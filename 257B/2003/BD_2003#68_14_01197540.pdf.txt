Abstract 
 
     E-commerce continues to grow however this will not 
mature until it becomes truly mobile - information 
available anywhere, anytime and to anybody. Applying 
mobile access to computing creates both tremendous 
commercial opportunities and complexity. It is becoming 
increasingly portable, as well as convenient as the 
wireless terminals can be installed in automobile 
dashboards and embedded in all manner of everyday 
appliances. Automobile manufacturers are beginning to 
offer wireless services to drivers but most in-car-
communications capabilities are still basic. Two primary 
areas of Telematics are: 
• On-board Telematics (CD ROM) & 
• Call centre Telematics 
     It is a big potential market for car manufacturers as 
millions of drivers spend many hours in their cars. 
However, the greatest challenges to the growth of mobile 
commerce are security and privacy issues and hence the 
lack of consumer confidence in mobile network security.

Introduction 
 
     Electronic commerce continues to see phenomenal 
growth, but most development of e-commerce involves 
wired infrastructures. Emerging wireless and mobile 
networks will provide new avenues for growth and new 
opportunities in mobile commerce [1]. 
     The growth of mobile applications will change the 
way people live, play and do business. The following 
evolutionary steps clarify how this would happen: 
Step 1: the user going to the computer’s location 
(computer-centric) 
Step 2: the computer is wherever the user is (person-
centric) [2]  
 
     Mobile commerce is the buying and selling of goods 
and services through wireless hand-held devices such as 
mobile phones, personal digital assistants (PDAs), mp3 
players, digital cameras, handheld gaming devices and 
computers [3]. M-commerce is facilitated by the 
convergence of the Internet, e-commerce and the wireless 
world where people can go online anytime, anywhere 
and using any device [2]. Some of examples of the 
wireless or mobile networks are GSM (Global Systems 
for Mobile Telecommunication), GPRS (General Packet 
Radio Services), CDMA (Code Division Multiple 
Access), Mobitex, Reflex and UMTS (Universal Mobile 
Telecommunication Systems) [4]. 
 
Research Rationale 
 
     This research originated as an attempt to understand 
why e-Business has not impacted significantly on the 
automobile industry. It could be surmised that m-
commerce will have a greater effect as it relates to 
mobility as does the motor industry. The approach is to 
acquire in-depth knowledge of security issues in wireless 
technologies as well as human stakeholders concerned 
about privacy issues against the convenience provided by 
the technology.  The theory and method adopted in the 
study is as follows: 
 
Methodology 
 
     Clarke [5] has outlined the challenges facing 
researchers in the domain of Electronic commerce. The 
‘high volatility of the phenomenon’ and lack of 
‘established definitions’ are obstacles to researchers 
trying to get high quality scientific data on which to base 
future hypotheses. 
     The literature review is the primary sources of 
research data including the World Wide Web, online

newspaper articles, newspapers through Factiva (Reuters 
and DowJones) and books such as ‘M-Commerce The 
race to Mobility [2] and ‘mCommerce Security: a 
beginner’s guide’ [4]. 
     This research was started by investigating the 
initiation, development and attempted adoption of m-
commerce across the automobile market. This paper 
represents one research facet of this data collection. This 
approach is in seeking to address ‘how’ and ‘why’ 
questions associated with this research. In the future, the 
researcher will undertake structured interviews with big 
players of manufacturers to develop a support system to 
clarify doubts of potential users. This will be reported on 
in a later paper. 
     In future, the methodology will also emphasize the 
importance of subjective meanings in the processes 
through which users react to Telematics [6]. This 
requires the use of field studies of humans in their 
settings so as to describe, interpret, analyze, and 
understand the social world from the participant’s 
perspective. That is, the process will be viewed as a 
social one, and the research will aim to capture the 
complex, dynamic nature of the social phenomena of 
Telematics. The research will seek to understand the 
process in practice from the participants’ perspectives, 
with a primary focus being the meaning of the 
technology to the individuals as well as their expectations 
around its use [6], particularly with respect to their 
social, cultural, and work contexts. 
 
Overview of M-Commerce 
 
     M-Commerce covers a multitude of industry sectors. 
Mobile phones and PDAs are frequently being used for 
conducting trades and logging on to wireless brokerage 
services in the USA. It is becoming increasingly portable 
as well as convenient to be installed in automobile 
dashboards [7]. Mobile banking is rapidly becoming a 
significant market for mobile consumers. Even most 
current news sites: CNN, Reuters, and BBC have started 
offering services whereby users can configure their 
mobile device to receive news and information content 
[4]. 
     M-commerce using mobile phone or handheld devices 
like PDAs are outlined in the table below:

    Implementation of wireless LAN (WLAN) has 
doubled over the last year in the USA according to 
Yankee Group. WLAN access points are becoming more 
common in malls, restaurants, and other high traffic 
locations [8]. It has been expected that 40 % of 
consumer-to-business e-commerce will come from smart 
phones using the wireless application protocol (WAP) by 
2004, according to the GartnerGroup, a market research 
firm [9].  
 
Functional Platforms of Mobile Commerce 
Applications 
 
     As discussed earlier, there are many ways mobile 
devices are used to conduct business and exchange 
information. The emerging unlimited number of potential 
mobile commerce applications can be classified into the 
following five platforms set out in the following table:

Mobile Commerce in the Automobile 
Industry 
      
     Electronic commerce has not affected the automotive 
industry as strongly as other consumer goods industries. 
So far, it has brought some cost savings for vehicle 
manufacturers by enabling them to streamline both 
supply-chain and retail processes [10]. Automobile 
manufacturers are beginning to offer wireless services to 
drivers. Mobile commerce will have a more fundamental 
impact: changing the features of the vehicle itself, and 
challenging car companies to become “mobility service 
providers”.  
 
Telematics  
 
     Telematics is the combination of the technologies of 
the Internet, the mobile phone and the automobile to 
provide increased safety and productivity by delivering 
better service and enjoyable trip for consumers. It is a 
mechanism for transforming the automobile into the 
mobile portal or a hands-free in-vehicle communication 
system [11].  In the past there have been two primary 
areas: 
• On-board Telematics – This system stores 
information on CD-ROMs that are located in the 
car, along with location positioning technology. 
Road maps in this form are most of time out-of-
date. 
• Call centre Telematics – This relies on phone 
calls to a call centre. Call centre lacks scalability 
and are prone to human error. Too expensive to 
run the centre. [12] 
     Mercedes-Benz was one of the first companies to 
describe ‘Telematics” as automotive communication 
technologies introducing SOS service (TeleAid) and 
followed by GM’s On-Star and Ford’s RESCU. The use 
of a GPS along with location-based mobile technology 
allow the service provider to assist drivers by providing 
directions, maps, traffic information and emergency 
roadside assistance. Car manufacturers are increasingly 
bringing wireless capabilities to their vehicles such as 
downloading music, returning email and on-the-road 
shopping. As market penetration increases and eventually 
demand for enriched content grows, and Telematics will 
become as a channel of information and entertainment. 
Drivers will be able turn on home lights, start and stop 
the sprinkler system, set their office and home security 
systems [2]. 
     The Telematics Research Group predicts that nearly 
21% of U.S. drivers will own vehicles that include some 
form of Telematics by 2006. Remote vehicle diagnostics 
and consumer desire for increased safety and security are 
driving the Telematics market in the fast lane [13]. 
 
Bluetooth 
 
     Bluetooth is a computing and telecommunication 
industry specification outlines on how mobile devices 
can interconnect with each other with home, business 
phones and computers using a short-range wireless 
communication [3]. 
     Future Bluetooth-based automotive applications are 
poised to deliver new opportunities to all facets of the 
industry from silicon vendors and hardware 
manufacturers, to automakers and gasoline retailers.

DaimlerChrysler's UConnect hands-free car kit, currently 
available as an option on certain Chrysler vehicles, 
serves as Bluetooth's U.S. introduction. Meanwhile in 
Europe, specific Saab and BMW models will also offer 
Bluetooth hands-free car kits as options [14]. Using 
Bluetooth to communicate with any mobile phone both in 
and out of the car, the unit includes a dashboard-mounted 
receiver and a microphone embedded in the rearview 
mirror and phone. While the system works with any 
carrier and phone number [13]. 
 
Business alliances for improved Telematics 
 
The Carucel infrastructure is the fourth generation (4G) 
technology that allows this necessary high bandwidth 
capacity (20 Mbps vs. 144 Kbps with 3G) while driving 
along the highway [15].  This high bandwidth capacity is 
critical for the mobile Internet which is expected to be 
the next tremendous growth area for wireless technology 
as evidenced by companies such as given below in the 
table.

     However, president CEO of ATX technologies Inc., 
the leading independent Telematics service provider to 
the automotive industry, emphasized on vRM (vehicle 
relationship management) and said, “In the five years 
we’ve been in the Telematics industry, ATX has learned 
that Telematics is all about customer satisfaction and 
customer satisfaction and customer loyalty, not creating a 
new business line or a mobile comer portal.” [16].  
     A new generation of Telematics will not only transmit 
location information but it also transmit a variety of data 
such as warning that electronic safety features of the 
automobile, designed to combat slippery road conditions, 
triggered at a specific time and location, at a specific 
speed. Convenient services enabled by new generation of 
systems, promote changes of lifestyle providing both 
location-based and context-aware services [17].  
     During next decade, drivers will find new cars 
equipped with wireless connectivity as a standard feature. 
As road congestion continues to increase, this feature 
will offer driver and passengers mobile services to 
exploit dead time lost in traffic with precise real-time 
information systems. This information also could be used 
to implement tidal routes, temporarily switching the 
direction of unused lanes in response to traffic demand 
and hence for the optimization of road space, traffic 
speed and journey times. This system will also help some 
authorities’ desires to collect tolls more efficiently, 
facilitate emergency services access to incidents and 
allow police forces to isolate fleeing criminals rapidly 
[2]. 
     The benefit offered by each convenience is associated 
with a loss of privacy. So mobility and the convenience 
of ubiquitous connectivity may be seen as a clear 
advantage of wireless technology, however these systems 
conflict with citizens’ rights to privacy in their 
movements [18].  
     The major challenge to make automobile a ‘mobility 
service provider” is to gain public acceptance of the 
technology and improve the security level in wireless 
technology. It is expected that enhanced vehicle safety 
Telematics features and vehicle relationship management 
(VRM) (customer-vehicle relationship) will provide 
customer satisfaction and increase customer loyalty to 
gain market place popularity. In order to improve the 
trust and security level, wireless encryption protocol 
(WEP) will be used to provide encryption over wireless 
network connections. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Mobile commerce is complementary to e-commerce. To 
extract value from e-commerce applications, new mobile 
application are needed that enable unprecedented ease

and speed of information access. However, it is certain 
that the mobile revolution will create tremendous 
opportunities for some companies and be a terrible threat 
to those who insist on status quo [2]. The future of 
Telematics shows promise but most in-car-
communications capabilities are still basic.  
Further research hopes to explore the greatest challenges 
to the growth of mobile commerce, security and privacy 
issues in mobile network security. Mobile commerce 
security equals Internet security plus wireless security. 
Wireless adds another layer of complexity and risk to 
safeguarding information because the infrastructure for 
m-commerce is much less mature, less reliable, and more 
vulnerable to a security breach by the very nature of how 
a wireless transaction is made [19].
