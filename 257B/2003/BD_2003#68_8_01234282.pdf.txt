Electrical components for 40Gb/s SONET OC-768 transmission
are of significant commercial interest in the optical networking
industry.  Recent work establishes the viability of advanced SiGe
technologies for use in OC-768 applications [1][2].  In this paper,
we present a 40/43Gb/s 4-to-1 MUX / CMU in a 120GHz fT SiGe
BiCMOS technology [3] that meets SONET OC-768 specifica-
tions.  The chip is co-packaged with a companion 16-to-4  MUX
(reported elsewhere), providing a complete OC-768 serializer and
CMU.
A block diagram of the chip appears in Fig. 13.4.1.  The chip inte-
grates three principle subsystems: a 40/43Gb/s 4-to-1 multiplex-
er, a 10Gb/s delay-locked loop (DLL), and a 20GHz half-rate
CMU.  The chip also includes a microprocessor serial interface,
transmit PLL lock monitoring, and a bandgap reference.
The multiplexer accepts four differential 10Gb/s current-mode
logic (CML) inputs.  Input data timing alignment is achieved
with a delay-locked loop (DLL) with on-chip loop filter providing
a 5GHz half-rate or 10GHz full-rate clock to the preceding 16-to-
4 multiplexer.  The DLL adjusts this clock to align the received
data to a local 10GHz clock. 
The incoming data is retimed and multiplexed up to 40Gb/s
using local clocks fed from the CMU.  An extra retiming latch is
used on alternating selector inputs to properly align clock and
data.  Clock delay-compensation buffers on the 20GHz clocks cor-
rect for propagation delay through the 10Gb/s latches and sub-
sequent selectors to improve setup-and-hold margins for the
20Gb/s data latches.  The final stage of the multiplexer uses a
half-rate architecture with no retiming latch after the selector. A
traveling-wave amplifier with on-chip 50‚Ñ¶ terminations drives
the 40Gb/s output with a 1Vp-p differential CML signal.  
A significant design challenge is to secure stable timing margins
over process, temperature and supply-voltage variations when
propagation delays are a significant fraction of the 25ps bit peri-
od.  The demands on timing accuracy are particularly acute in
the 20Gb/s latches and final selector stage where small timing
deviations contribute to eye closure and degradation in bit error
ratio (BER) performance.  
Figure 13.4.2 shows a circuit diagram of a 20Gb/s latch and illus-
trates the clocking architecture used in the 20Gb/s section of the
multiplexer to ensure timing stability.  In this architecture, an in-
phase clock retimes the selector input, while a quadrature clock
operates the selector itself.  If the propagation delays of the active
circuitry were zero, the quadrature clock would have high and low
levels precisely centered in the 20Gb/s data eyes.  This condition
maximizes the selector timing margin.  In reality, the re-timed
data is delayed significantly due to the latch clock-to-Q delay and
clock propagation delay.  To restore and stabilize the desired tim-
ing relationship between the selector clock and retimed data, a
replica delay-compensation buffer provides a matched delay for
the quadrature clock signal.  The resulting timing relationships
are illustrated in the timing diagram of Fig. 13.4.2.  Note that the
selector clock is positioned in the middle of the 20Gb/s data eye,
maximizing the timing margin and stabilizing performance
against process, voltage and temperature variations.
The 20GHz CMU provides in-phase and quadrature clocks to the
multiplexer.  The CMU uses an on-chip voltage-controlled oscil-
lator (VCO) with coarse and fine tuning control [4].  An analog
PLL with on-chip loop filter sets the fine control voltage, while
the coarse control is set digitally.  This technique permits a
smaller VCO gain slope for the analog loop and reduces the sen-
sitivity to supply noise injection.  The PLL sets the VCO fre-
quency to track an external 625MHz or 2.5GHz reference clock
over about 40MHz bandwidth.  Upon reset, an on-chip calibra-
tion loop automatically sets the coarse frequency control accord-
ing to the reference frequency supplied.  
A die photo of the MUX/CMU is shown in Fig. 13.4.3. The die
area is 8.25mm2.  The high operating frequency calls for meticu-
lous attention to detail in the layout, particularly in the 20GHz
clock distribution network, where in-phase and quadrature clock
delay matching is critical.  The layout makes extensive use of on-
chip transmission lines, which were carefully modeled in design
simulations.    
The die is co-packaged with a companion 16:4 MUX chip in a cus-
tom ceramic package.  The measurement data presented here
are taken in this configuration with a 2.5GHz reference clock.
Figure 13.4.4  shows the 40Gb/s data eye with 231-1 PRBS input
data as measured with a digital communications analyzer (DCA)
having about 150fs rms intrinsic jitter.  The DCA was triggered
at 10GHz for this measurement.  The eyes are clearly open,
entirely free of sparkle, and exhibit excellent symmetry between
adjacent eyes.  The corresponding 20GHz clock duty cycle is esti-
mated to be better than 51%.  The measured data jitter is 880fs
rms and 5.1ps peak-to-peak.  A 1010 input pattern was also used
to determine the CMU random jitter generation.  This jitter was
about 250fs rms on the DCA, including timebase jitter.  The
phase noise of the 1010 pattern was also measured on a spec-
trum analyzer.  The results, shown in Fig. 13.4.5, are used to
estimate the high-band jitter to check compliance with ITU
G.8251 jitter generation limits.  The phase noise at offsets below
1MHz is determined by the reference oscillator, provided by an
external cleanup PLL.  The high-band jitter is 116fs rms (about
1.6 ps, peak-to-peak), including the reference, which exceeds ITU
G.8251 specifications by about 4dB. To the authors‚Äô knowledge,
this is the first OC-768 MUX/CMU to meet G.8251 specifica-
tions.  The total random jitter generation (excluding the refer-
ence oscillator) is estimated at 175fs rms, which is consistent
with DCA measurements.  The packaged multiplexer achieved
error-free operation with 231-1 PRBS input data for 12 hours, at
which point the test was terminated.  This result implies a BER
of less than 4 x 10-16 with 50% confidence. The total power con-
sumption is 4.9 W.  The measurement results are summarized in
Fig. 13.4.6.
