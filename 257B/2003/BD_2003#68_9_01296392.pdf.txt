Abstract 
Image processing in discrete systems assumes an 
application of digital filtration methods and the 
spectral analysis using Discrete (Fast) Fourier 
Transformation. In many applied problems the error 
brought by aprocessing method or a computing system, 
is comparable with the error o f f n a l  result getting, the 
matter of extent of an error of data discretization 
therefore is topical. 
The problem of definition of the relative error of 
discretization of Fourier transformation is solved in the 
offered paper. It is shown that for  considered types of 
real signals the discretization error decreases in 
inverse proportion to the squared number of discrete 
points. For sume simple types of functions exact 
expressions for  discrete spectrum and the approached 
expressions of discretization error corresponding to 
them are received at the big number ofpoints. 
1. Introduction 
Discrete (or Fast) Fourier Transformation (DFT or 
FFT) [ I ]  still remains one of mathematical methods 
most used at the solution of various applied problems. 
In particular, its applications are well known at digital 
image processing in tasks of modeling, analyzing, 
interpolating, recovering, filtering etc. Still, data 
discretization is inevitable in many problems, and in 
some of them is even essential, since data processing is 
made by means of computers. Therefore the important 
problem is the definition or the estimation of the errors 
occurring at discretization of images and the subsequent 
application of a processing method. This problem is 
rather old; it has been considered, perhaps, since the 
times of the beginning of differential and integral 
calculus. There are numerous publications, many results 
can he found in handbooks, textbooks and monographs 
on numerical methods. 
The essence of the given problem has again 
increased at the second half of the last century under the 
influence of the following circumstances: 
a) Many information-measuring on-line systems for 
science, industry, space researches as well as in other 
important areas of human activity have appeared. The 
problem of the information extent for these systems 
remains sharp despite the presence of super-power 
computers and other computing systems. 
b) Requirements for accuracy of the received end 
product for which the size of the error brought by a 
method of processing or, generally, by the computing 
system, are the important component. 
The problem of definition of discretization error of 
Fourier Transformation is especially important in the 
applications of radiophysics at the restoration of spatial 
distribution of the radiation field of radiating systems 
by discrete measurements of complex characteristics of 
the field in their aperture (so-called NF-FF systems 
[2]). In these systems the number of measurements is 
not usually too great (hence, the error of discretization is 
not too small), a restored far-field and some integral 
characteristics are required to be determined precisely 
enough. In similar systems the attempt to avoid the 
specified errors of processing usually transforms to 
very expensive hardware complications. 
The presented paper is dedicated to the problem of 
the exact and approximate definition of a relative error 
of discretization of Fourier transformation. 
2. Target settings 
Let f(x) be a real function defined in the interval 
-a I 2  5 x 5 a I 2  , and its Fourier transformation be 
a i 2  
F(w) = If(x)exp(-jwx)dx . (1) 
- . / I  
By replacement of variables the formula (1) usually 
results to the kind 
F(u) = jf(p)exp(-jup)dp. (2) 
-1 
For brevity we'll call F(u) the spectrum of (finite) 
function f(p) . Function f(p) is (one-dimensional) 
representation of the signal on the coerced interval 
(-1,l) .  At discretization of function f(p) points are 
undertaken with an interval Ap = 2 I N  , i.e. reference 
points are pi = -1 + iAp i = 0,1, .._, N - 1  , where N is 
the size of total number of points. Then the integral ( 2 )  
turns into the sum 
S-1 
F ( u ) = ~ p ~ f ( p ~ ) e - i u ~ i .  i=O (3) 
By substituting values pi in (3) and also U = rrk , 
k = 0, f I, + 2, ... we receive

F ( ~ ) = ( 2 / N ) ~ ~ ” ~ ~ f ( - 1 + 2 i / N ) ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ .  (4) 
The sum in (4) represents the formula of the discrete 
(fast) Fourier transformation applied to sequence 
f ( p , ) ,  i=O,l, ..., N - 1 .  
Let F ~ ( u )  and Fo(u) be the normed on a 
maximum value of (2) and (4) correspondingly. We 
shall define a relative error of discretization of image 
snectrum restoration via the formula 
i=O 
in the points of continuity (5). Note that for real (or 
complex, but inphase) fimctions f(p) the maximal 
value of the module Fo(u) (no less than Fa (U)) is 
reached in the point of U = 0 ,  therefore 
F ~ ( U ) = F ( U ) ~ F ( O )  M F o ( u ) = F ( ~ ) / F ( 0 ) .  (6) 
Research of ( 5 )  is of interest at fixed N and at 
N + m for various types of functions f(p)  , including 
parametrical families of the functions usually 
considered in the problems of image processing, in 
particular - in the theory of radiating systems. 
Exact and asymptotic expressions of the spectra (6) 
for the same functions f(p) will be resulted below. 
3. Main results 
3.1. Research me thod  
Note that the exponent parameter in (3) and (4) 
linearly depends on the attitude u l N  . Therefore the 
normalized discrete spectrum of a wide class of 
functions f(p)  may be represented as 
where the functions g,,s (U), I = 1,2, ... generally 
depend on N and are complex. However, as in the 
considered cases these functions don’t depend on N ,  
i.e. g,,N(n) = g ,  (U). I = 1,2 ,... , then, for simplicity, we’ll 
omit the index N .  
As the module of a spectrum of real f(p) is sym- 
metric, g, (U) 0 ,  and (7) contains only terms with 
even degrees of the ratio u / N .  Therefore, if 
g , ( u ) t O ,  at small values of the ratio we have 
A N  = g,(u)(u/N)1 with an accuracy of up to terms of 
higher order. 
Note that for concrete types of functions f(p) 
calculation of continuous and discrete spectra (6), or of 
set of functions gl(u), I = 1,2, ... reduces, basically, to 
technical difficulties. Nevertheless, for many types of 
functions f(p) the specified calculations are made 
completely [3] and some of them are brought in the 
presented article. 
3.2. Some s imple  s t a n d a r d  functions 
At the solution of some applied problems it is accep- 
ted to use the standard models described by functions of 
type f(p)  , We shall consider the most elementaly of 
them. 
1. f ( p j = l . T h e n  
I F . ( u ) ~  = Isp(u)/ = Isin U I UI , 
I F 0  (u)l= Isp(u)/sp(u/N)I. 
Thenweget  A , ( u ) = l - l / / s p ( u / N ) / .  
At the small ratios U I N  we have 
2. f(p) = cns(np / 2) Here we get

F0(n)=- 
4N’ s inz(n/2N) 
n’ cns u 
E’ -4u’ 
where cp(u) = ~ a,p = U /  N f  E /  2N,  
3. f ( p ) = l - p ’ .  Inthiscase 
3(sin U - U  cns U )  
U’ 
Fo (U) = 
3 sin u ctg(u / N) - N cos u 
Fo(u) = 
N(N’ -1) sin2(u / N)

where g,(u) = 
2F: (U) 
It is interesting to notice, that at small U ,  and also at 
u+m (utnk) A N ( u ) = - -  I[’]’, - and at u + m

( u = x / 2 + a k )  
3.3. Families of one parameter functions 
Here we shall get results of calculations in the case of 
more complex functions f(p) containing one parameter. 
We’ll consider three families of such functions and we’ll 
get results of calculations comesponding to them. 
7. f , (p)=S+(I-F)cos(np/2) .  ’ 
Obviously, this case covers the types of function 
f(p) considered above: at 6 = 1 we have case 1 (see 
item ;.I), and at S = 0 - case 2 (this function is known 
also under the name “cosine on a pedestal”). Accordingly 
we have 
F&) =asdu)+(l -a)cdu), a=niWln6+2(l - @ I ,  
Fa (U) = aNsP s (4 + (1 - aN )CP, (ub 
where sps(u)=sp(u)exp(ju/N)sp(u/N),  
ax  = n6/[xS+2(1-G)ctg(n/2N)j1 
cp(u)sp’(n/2N)

shown that the minimal value of P(a) is achieved at 
S = 0.54 and is equal to 0.1. 
8. fa (p )=6+(1 -6 ) (1 -p’ ) .  This functionrepresents 
a linear combination of func.tions 1 and 3. We have 
&(U) = asp(u)+(l -a)g(u) ,  
where a = 3 S / ( 2 + 6 ) , g ( u ) = 3 ( s i n u - ~ c o s u ) / u ’ ,  
F o ( U ) = a N s p . ( U ) + ( l - - a N ) g , ( U ) ,  
a N  = a [ l - ( 1 - a ) / ” ] ,  
3[sin uctg(u / N) - N cos U] 
g,(u)-= 
N(Nz - l )s in’(u/N) ’ 
A,(u) = -S(a)u’ IN’ , 
S(a)  ii (17a’ -24a  + 1 2 ) / 3 0 .  
We notice that at 6 = 1 a = 1 and S(a)  = 1 /6, and 
at 6 = 0 a = 0 and S(a) = 1 /  3 ,  thus coinciding with 
the formulas (8) and (10) got earlier. 
9. f(p) = ev-a lpl ) .  
F,(u)= a n a +exp(-a)(usinu -acosu)

where 
Q(u;a)  = 1 1 9 + l y ( u ; a ) -  2 / 3 1 ‘  1 2 ;  
u(n;a)= p(a)sp(u)lF,(u); Ma) = a/lexp(a)-lI
