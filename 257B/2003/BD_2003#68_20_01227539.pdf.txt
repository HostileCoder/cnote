The issue of handwritten character recognition is still a big challenge to the scientific 
community. Several approaches to address this challenge have been attempted in the last 
years, mostly focusing on the English preprinted or handwritten characters space. Thus 
the need to attempt a research related to Arabic handwritten text recognition. 
Algorithms based on neural networks have proved to give better results than conventional 
methods when applied to problems where the decision rules of the classification problem 
are not clearly defined. Two neural networks were built to classify already segmented 
characters of handwritten Arabic text. The process starts by using a neuro-conventional 
algorithm, and a neural network for segmenting binarized connected blocks of characters; 
then, a heuristic algorithm extracts features from these characters and feeds them into two 
neural networks for classification purpose. The two neural networks correctly recognized 
73% of the characters. 
However, one hurdle was encountered in the above scenario, which can be summarized 
as follows: there are a lot of handwritten characters that can be segmented and classified 
into two or more different classes depending on whether they are looked at separately, or 
in a word, or even in a sentence. In other words, character classification, especially 
handwritten Arabic characters, depends largely on contextual information, not only on 
topographic features extracted from these characters.
