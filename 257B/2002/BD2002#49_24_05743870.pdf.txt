1_ INTRODUCTION 
Spanish is spoken by more than 300 000 Million people and is 
considered as one of the global langusges in the world. Spanish 
is an official language in Spain and all the countries in Latin 
America except Brazil. Moreover, the number of people who 
speak Spanish in the US is growing every day. The geographic 
distribution of Spanish is VCJY wide, it's spoken in Europe and in 
America from US to the Antarctica. The geographical dispersion, 
the existence of native languages in the Latin American 
countries where Spanish is spoken and the evolution of the 
language in each country along the time, prompted the apparition 
of dialectal variants. 
The dialectal variants have been described in the literature and 
include phonetic, lexical, semantic and cultural variations among 
others. Focusing on the importance of dialectal variants from the 
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) point of view, Moreoo 
(I] tries to cluster wide geographic areas or countries where 
phonetic similarities can be useful to have a unique ASR system, 
and it gives the general rules to describe such phonetic 
differences. 
The lack of suited databases to properly train ASK in each Latin 
American country is being overcome. Adding to the former 
V AHA or CALL HOME databases available in the LDC [2]. the 
SpccchDat Across Latin America (SALA) [I] project has 
developed a set of telephone databases in most of the countries 
(). 7803-7402·9/02/$ 17.00 ClZOO2 IEEE 
in Latin America allowing to train ASR systems. The SALA 
project was born with the objective of solving the lack of 
databases in Latin America using the specifications of 
SpeechDat (3] project that is considered close to a standard. 
Di fferent approximations can be found in the literature to cope 
with the multi-dialectal ASR. systems. A good tutorial is given in 
(4]. Acoustic-phonetic modeling and clustering of HMM, 
pronunciation modeling either data driven or 1aI0wleclge-based 
are commonly used. 
This paper deals with the suitability of using a single multi­
dialectal acoustic modeling for all the Spanish variants spoken in 
Europe and Latin America. The objective is two fold. First, it 
allows to usc all the available databases to jointly train and 
improve the same system. Second, it a1iows to use a single 
system for all the Spanish speaken. The experiments addressed 
in this paper have as intermediate objectives to show: a) the 
suitability of the rule-based phonetic transcription system for all 
the Spanish variants, b) the results of a single-dialect system 
used by another dialect, and c) the results of a multi-dialect 
system used to recognize utterances from a dilliect not included 
in the training set. The dialectal variants chosen in this paper are: 
Spanish as spoken in Spain, Colombia, Venezuela (Caribbean) 
and Argentina . All the Spanish variants are considered different 
from the linguistic point of view and representative of a wide 
number of Spanish speakers. 
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 shortly descnDcS 
the phonetic transcription and phonetic differences among 
dialects, section 3 shows the recognition system and sections 4 
and S describe the experiments and results. 
2. TRANSCRIPTION 
The phonetic. transcription used in this project is done in 
SAMPA symbols. For each dialectal variant considered in this 
project, a canonical phonetic transcription was defined and 
implemented. The canonical phonetic transcription of each 
dialectal variant is defined as the most COllUDOn variant, in 
number of speakers, of a given country or area. For the 
Caribbean variant, the variant spoken in Caracas was chosen; for 
Colombia, the dialectal variant spoken in Bogota was considered 
as canonical, and for the Argentinian variant, the canonical 
variant was chosen as the Spanish as spoken in Buenos Aires. 
1- 841 
TllIIIscriptions are obtained in an automatic fonn, each dialect 
with its specific tIlIIiscription. The rule-based phonetic 
tIlIIiscription is based on a previous work [5] and modifies the 
canonical phonetic transcription of' the Spanish as spoken in 
Spain [6). For the considered dialects it can be summarized as 
follows: 
Colombia 
• Pronunciation of rrl as lsi 
• IU is always uttered as Ijjl 
• The velar fricative Ix! is uttered as glottal !hi. 
• The sounds 1bI, Idl and Ig! are always pronounced as stop 
consonants except in post-nuclear position or in the onset of 
a syllable following a vowel. In these cases, the 
approximant allophones (IB!, 101 or IG/) are standard. 
Vene2:uela (Caribbean) 
• Pronunciation of rr I as lsi 
• IU is always uWlred as Ijjl 
• The voiceless velar fricative Ix! is uttered as voiceless 
glottal fricative !hi. 
• WhCn in coda position,lsI is tIlIIIsformed in !hi. 
• Nasal consonants in post-nuclear position are velar INI. 
Argentina 
• Pronunciation of rr I as Is! 
• Both IU and lijl are tIlIIisfonned into voiced palatoalveolar 
fricative IZI. After a nasal consonant, IZJ is produced as 
IdZI. 
lsi in post-nuclear position is tIlIIisformed in !hi, el\cept at 
the end of a word before a pause or a vowel.

3. RECOGNITION SYSTEM 
3.1. System description 
This work was implemented in a recognition system developped 
at Universitat Politecllica de Catalunya. Spain, called RAMSES 
[7]. 
The system is based on Semicontinous Hidden Marcov Models 
(SCHMM). Speech signals are parameterized with mel-cestrum 
and each frame is represented by their Cepstrum C, their 
derivatives /\,C, MC and the derivative of the Energy. The three 
first features are represented by S 12 gaussians and the Energy 
derivative by 128 gaussians. The phonetic units for this task are 
demiphones. Each phonetic unit is modeled by a 2 states left to 
right model. 
A context dependent (CD) demiphone model is created if the 
number of training rea1iutions in the training set, for that 
particular unit, is higher than a threshold . Otherwise, a context 
independent (CI) demiphone is used. CI demiphones arc trained 
with all the available realiutions of that demiphone.The 
threshold in the recognition system is set to 100 realiutions. 
3.2 Acoustic: modeling 
Two different kind of systerm are modeled . Mono-dialectal 
systems and one multi-dialectal system. Three different mono­
dialectal systerm were trained with data from Spain. Colombia 
and Veneruela. Some previous experiments [8J were perfonned 
to choose a suited set of phonemes. In particular it was decided 
to model separately fbI, Id!, Ig!, fBI, IDI, IG/, and In!, INI and 
jointly /U and lij/. The phonetic inventory for each mono­
dialectal is described in Table 1. Each mono-dialectal system is 
trained with the available data for that dialect. 
Cross-dialectal speech recognition experiments require cross­
dialect phoneme mapping since there are missing sounds in the 
phonetic inventory of the system to evaluate. As it was 
introduced in the transcription section, model candidates were 
selected based on phonetic knowledge. Experiments were done 
so as to decide the best mapping phonemes in order to improve 
the recognition rate. 
The final cross-dialect phoneme mapping decisions arc presented 
in Table 2. This table is read in the following manner, i.e. if we 
have the system trained in "Spain" and we want to recogni2'C 
speakers from "Colombia" we use the lsi model trained in 
"Spain" to represent the Colombian !hi phone. 
Dark cells indicate that the mapping process can be done 
directly, that is , no phoneme is missing. 
Table 2. Cross-dialect phoneme mapping decisions 
The multi-dialectal system was created with a single phonetic 
inventory, that is, all the dialects share the same acoustic models. 
The idea behind this is to include similar sounds in a single 
model having all the possible realiutions in it. Moreover the 
system is more robust to tIlIIiscription errors possibly due to 
gencrali2:ation of rules over a big number of speakers. 
Models are created from training material from all the dialects 
and the mal\imum number of speakers and utterances. The 
mapping of the phonetic units is done directly fro� their 
1- 842 
SAMP A representation, that is, those sounds with the same 
SAMP A symbol contribute to the training of the same HMM. 
These models fonn the biggest part of the inventory. Dialectal 
specific phones are trained with their dialect specific database 
only and are added to the global inventory. In tenns of phones, 
the: muiti-dialectaI phonetic inventory is composed by 32 
phones. 30 phones are trained with data from all the dialects, the 
phone IbJ is bained with data from Colombia and Venezuela and 
the phone rrl from Spanish as spoken in Spain is bained from 
data from that country only. 
A silence and a noise models are also used. 
4. DESCRIPTION OF EXPERIMENTS 
4 ••• Training and testing data 
In this work. the databases used for training and testing the ASR 
systems belong to the SpeecbDat and SALA projects. 
The database of Spanish as spoken in Spain was created in the 
framework of the SpeechDat project. The database consist of 
fixed network telephone recordings from 4000 different 
speakers. Signals were sampled and recorded from an ISDN line 
at 8KHz, 8 bits and coded with A law. Each speaker utters 45 
sentences either reading or answering some questions. Speakers 
were selected to have a broad coverage of ages and dialectal 
distribution in the country. In this work, 3500 speakers were 
selected for training purposes and 200 speakers for testing. 
The database of Spanish as spoken in !he different dialectal 
variants of Latin America, were created in the SALA project. 
Each database consist of fixed network telephone recordings 
from 1000 different speakers. Signals from the Colombian and 
Argentinean databases were recorded and stored from an ISDN 
line at 8KHz. 8 bits and A law coded. The Venezuelan database 
was recorded from an analogue telephone line and stored with 11 
law code. The criteria for speaker selection follow the SpeecbDat 
project. 800 speakers from each database were selected for 
training and 200 speakers for testing. 
The systems were trained with a set of phonetically ricb 
sentences and phonetically rich words. Only clean data was used, 
avoiding material with intennittent noise and mispronounced 
words and truncations. 
The recognition systems WCI'e evaluated with a test set consisting 
of isolated application words (i.e:. delete, enter, etc.) and isolated 
digits (from zero to nine). 
The specific data for training and testing is exposed below: 
• Train. Four different training sets are defined, 
corresponding to the dialects spoken in Spain, Colombia, 
Venezuela and a combined set of an of them. 
• Telt. Five tests were created, one for each considered 
dialect. In all the tests there are 40 possible different words 
to be recogni�ed (30 application words plus the teo digits). 
The total number of utterances for each training sct and test set is 
swnmarizcd in Table 3. The combined training set is composed 
by the sum of all the training utterances

4.2. E:s:perimental Systems 
Four different systems were created Three of them are mono­
dialect, that is, each one belongs only to a single dialect (Spanish 
as spoken in Spain, Colombian and Venezuelan). The remaining 
is the multilingual system trained simultaneously with these 
three dialects. Argentinean dialect is separau:d from all the 
training process. 
Table 4 shows the number of models finally created and how 
many of these models are context dependent or context 
independent.

Table 4. Number of models of demiphones created for each 
system created. 
The four systems will be evalusted with all the five tests. There 
are three points in which the expetimcnls are divided: 
• The performance of each mono-dialect system is measured 
in order to have a value to compare it with other results 
obtained with other different systems. 
• Cross-dialecl recognition are done to compare the 
pcrfonnance of the systems and to observe similarities 
between the dialects. 
• The multi-diaiectaI system is evaluated recognizing the 
three dialects present in the training process and 
recognizing the dialect kept out of the system, the 
Argentinean. 
5. RESULTS 
All the results presented in this section are expressed in tenns of 
% WER in the recognition of words or utterances of the test set. 
They are summarized in Table S. The different experiments are 
commented in the follOWing sections.

5.1 Mono-dialeet I)'ltenIa 
As it was supposed, the best perfonnance is given for the system 
of Spain since it has been trained with more data than the others. 
Both Colombian and Venezuelan systems have similar 
performance, despite the poor training for the Colombian 
system. 
5.2. Cross-diaJedI e:Ilperiments 
These results show that the systems are nearly equivalent with 
little differences in the performance and with better results 
depending on the nwnber of speakers. 
Apparently, there are no deviations due to the different recording 
system used in Venezuela (analogue lines, JL law) and in the 
other countries (ISDN lines, A law encoding). 
Looking at the recognition results of the system trained with data 
from "Spain·, it seems that Argentinean is closer to the Spanish 
spoken in Spain than to other Latin American countries. This 
agrees with the classical separation of the Latin American 
dialects. 
5.3. Multi-dialect experiments 
A grest improvement is obtained with the multi-dialcclal system. 
Table 5 let us to compare the results obtained with lite multi· 
dialect system and each mono-dialect system. The results show: 
• The test set from Spain has a WER of 1.3 when is applied 
to the mono-dialect system and is reduced to 1.1 when is 
applied to the multi-dialect system. The WER is reduced in 
a 20% 
• The WER obtained with the Colombian set is reduced a 
27% 
• The Venezuelan dialect obtains a WER reduction of a 57%. 
• Argentinean dialect keeps the same result when is applied 
10 the multi-dialect system as when is appl ied 10 the system 
trained in Spain. 
6. CONCLUSIONS 
The performed experiments validate the aulomatic rule-based 
Spanish phonetic transcription. 
Cross dialect experiments show the necessity of joining efforts 
among different databases to improve the recognition results. 
Multi-dialectal systems can work as a single system to cope with 
all the Spanish dialects. 
Currently, the authors are wolking in modeling a complete 
system for Latin America with additional data from Chile and 
Mexico.
