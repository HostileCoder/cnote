Abstract—Spatial Reuse Protocol (SRP) is a Media Access Control 
(MAC)-layer protocol that operates over a double counter-rotating 
ring network topology.  SRP is designed to enhance the SONET 
network so that it can handle data traffic more efficiently. We study 
all-terminal reliability of SRP ring implementing Intelligent 
Protection Switch (IPS) and Enhanced Intelligent Protection 
Switch (E-IPS).  For this purpose, we calculate reliability for all 
scenarios under which all-terminal connectivity is maintained.  By 
summing up the results arising from individual mutually exclusive 
events, all-terminal reliabilities for IPS and E-IPS are obtained.  By 
further assuming constant and time-dependent component failure 
rates, Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) and Mean Time to Failure 
Improvement Factor (MTIF) measures are calculated.  Results 
show that MTTF/MTIF vary as functions of network size, 
component reliability and coverage factor.  The advantage of E-IPS 
over IPS is more obvious when network size is big and concentrator 
failure rate is small.  Our analysis could be helpful to network 
designers who wish to determine whether the additional 
cost/complexity added by the E-IPS scheme is justified. 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
Spatial Reuse Protocol (SRP) Technology is a media-
independent Media Access Control (MAC)-layer protocol that 
operates over a double counter-rotating ring network topology.  
SRP is designed to enhance Synchronous Optical Network 
(SONET) network (traditionally optimized for voice traffic) in 
order to handle data traffic more efficiently [1][2][3].   
The double counter-rotating ring architecture has been 
adopted for both the Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) 
token ring and for SONET network.  The double counter-
rotating ring consists of a set of nodes and links connecting 
them (Figure 1).  Each node is connected to its neighbor by 2 
links.  One set of the links makes up primary ring and the other 
set of links makes up the backup ring.  Data transmission on 
primary ring and backup ring are on opposite directions.  
While the traditional SONET ring keeps a backup ring free 
of traffic in case of primary ring failure, SRP ring would use 
both backup ring and primary ring for traffic.  Theoretically, 
the SRP ring doubles the available bandwidth to users.   
All-terminal reliability (Rall) is defined as the reliability that 
all nodes on the ring are operating and can communicate with 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: SRP double ring 
each other [11].  In Schupke’s work [4], SRP Ring all-terminal 
connectivity is maintained under the following mutually 
exclusive events: a) all parts of the network are operational or 
b) one link failure that is healed by IPS (Intelligent Protection 
Switch). 
In this paper, we also consider the case of Enhanced 
Intelligent Protection Switch (E-IPS) that utilizes 
a concentrator to enhance the SRP ring availability/reliability.  
All-terminal reliability for both IPS and E-IPS protected rings 
is calculated.   Availability/reliability improvement due to E-
IPS is also analyzed. 
In this paper, we refer to “link-pair” as the two adjacent 
links between two (neighboring) nodes. The following 
symbols are used in the reliability models:  
N = number of nodes attached to the ring. 
rn(t) = Reliability function of a node. 
rA(t) = Reliability function of a link. 
CA = Probability that a link failure is bypassed by self-healing. 
rc(t) = Reliability function of a concentrator (for E-IPS). 
II. INTELLIGENT PROTECTION SWITCHING IN SRP RING 
A. Overview [5][6] 
Intelligent Protection Switching is a family of features for 
the SRP ring: 
1. Performance Monitoring and failure detection. 
2. Fast ring wrapping after failure detection. 
3. Packet re-routing adaptive to topology change.

In this section we list scenarios under which all-terminal 
connectivity is maintained and derive expressions for the 
corresponding probability of occurrence (reliability functions). 
B. Scenario1: single fiber cut  
If a single fiber cut occurred between node A and B, the 
two nodes will wrap their fiber (Figure 2).  As a result, ring is 
wrapped and all the nodes are still connected on the ring.   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2: Scenario 1: Single fiber cut 
C. Scenario 2: double fiber cuts on a link-pair 
If there is a double fiber cut between nodes A and B, nodes 
A and B would wrap the fibers so that all nodes are still 
connected on the ring (Figure 3).  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3: Scenario 2: Double fiber cut on a link-pair 
D. Scenario 3: dual single fiber cuts on different link-pairs 
If there are two single fiber cuts on different link-pairs, all 
nodes involved would wrap the fibers so that two separate 
rings (A-B and C-D) are generated (Figure 4).  Under the IPS 
scheme, all-terminal connectivity is not maintained. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4: Scenario 3: Dual single fiber cut on different link-pairs 
E. Scenario 4: double fiber cuts on different link-pairs 
If there are two double fiber cuts on different link-pairs, all 
nodes involved would wrap the fibers so that two separate 
rings (A-B and C-D) are generated (Figure 5).  Under the IPS 
scheme, all-terminal connectivity is not maintained.

F. All-terminal Reliability (IPS aproach) 
To obtain the all-terminal reliability for IPS, probabilities 
for different scenarios are calculated as follows: 
Scenario 0 (fault-free case): all links are operational and all 
nodes are operational.  The conditional probability of this 
scenario is given by: P(“all-terminal connectivity 
maintained”|“all links operational”) = [rn(t)]N .  Since P(“all 
links are operational”) = [rA(t)]
2N, the unconditional probability 
of this scenario is given by  
R0(N,t)  = [rn(t)N][rA(t)
 2N] .   (1) 
Scenario 1 (single fiber cut): one link fails, all the other 
(2N-1) links and all N nodes are fine, and self-healing is 
successful (CA = self-healing coverage = conditional 
probability of successful healing after a link failure).  The 
conditional probability of this scenario is given by: P(“all-
terminal connectivity maintained”|“one link failure”) = 
CA[rn(t)
N].  Since P(“one link failure”) = 2N(1-rA(t))[rA(t)]
2N-1, 
the unconditional probability of this scenario is given by            
R1(N,t) = 2NCA[1-rA(t)][rA(t)]
2N-1[rn(t)]N.       (2) 
Scenario 2 (double link failures on a link-pair): Two links 
on a link-pair fail, all the other (2N-2) links and all N nodes 
are working fine, and self-healing is successful.  The 
conditional probability of this scenario is given by: P(“all-
terminal connectivity maintained”|“link-pair failure”) = 
CA[rn(t)
N].  Since P(“link-pair failure”) = N(1-rA(t))
2 [rA(t) ]
2N-2, 
the unconditional probability is given by: 
            R2(N,t) = NCA[1-rA(t)]
2 [rA(t)]
2N-2[rn(t)]N.                        (3) 
Since the three scenarios described above are mutually 
exclusive, we obtain the all-terminal reliability for IPS as: 
R(N,t) = R0(N,t) +R1(N,t) + R2 (N,t) = [rn(t)N][rA(t)
2N]+  
2NCA[1-rA(t)][rA(t)]
2N-1[rn(t)]N + NCA[1-rA(t)]
2 [rA(t)]
2N-2[rn(t)]N.

It is convenient to assume that tλe(t)r AA −= and 
tnλe(t)nr −= (exponential reliability function, λn and λA  are 
constant failure rates of a link and a node respectively).

III. ENHANCED INTELLIGENT PROTECTION SWITCH (E-IPS) 
A. Overview [7] 
Intelligent concentrators [10] are used in E-IPS approach to 
enable logical ring over physical star topology.  Each node is 
connected to the concentrators (located in a central location) so 
that ring is transformed into a star configuration (Figure 6). 
Network managers can reconfigure the ring at the central 
location without rewiring.   
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 6: E-IPS topology: physical star and logical ring 
Since there is a concentrator between each pair of nodes, 
concentrator reliability has an impact on system reliability.   
Reliability function of a concentrator is denoted as rc(t). 
For the scenario 1 and 2 described in section II, E-IPS 
concentrators are transparent to the network and the IPS 
protocol deals with the wrapping of the ring.  As a result, all-
terminal connectivity is maintained for these scenarios.  In 
addition, E-IPS is also able to maintain all-terminal 
connectivity for scenario 3 and 4.  In this section, all-terminal 
reliability is calculated for scenario 3, 4 and for E-IPS. 
B. Scenario 3: dual single fiber cuts on different link-pairs 
For scenario 3 (dual single fiber cuts on different link-
pairs), E-IPS reconfiguration can maintain all-terminal 
connectivity (while IPS by itself cannot, as shown at section 
II).  In this example (Figure 7), nodes A and B have failed 
links (first cut occurs on link connecting first concentrator and 
node A, second cut occurs on link connecting node B and third 
concentrator), and nodes A and B represent the points where 
the ring turns around after healing.  The reconfiguration is 
implemented by rewiring among concentrator ports (rewiring 
represented by heavy dark lines in Figure 7).  
Note here that E-IPS cannot tolerate more than 2 failed 
connections while maintaining the all-terminal connectivity.  
For example, if there is one more failed link between C and D 
in our example, node C and D would have to wrap and two 
separate rings (A-C and B-D) would be generated. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 7: Scenario 3: Two Single Fiber Cuts or Node Failure (E-IPS) 
C. Scenario 4: dual double fiber cuts on different link-pairs 
For scenario 4 (dual double fiber cuts on different link-
pairs), E-IPS reconfiguration can maintain all-terminal 
connectivity (while IPS by itself cannot, as shown at section 
II).  In this example (Figure 8), nodes A and B have failed 
links (first double cuts occurs on links connecting first 
concentrator and node A, second double cuts occurs on links 
connecting node B and third concentrator), and nodes A and B 
represent the points where the ring turns around after healing.  
The reconfiguration is implemented by rewiring among 
concentrator ports (rewiring represented by heavy dark lines in 
Figure 8). Again, E-IPS cannot tolerate more than 2 failed 
connections and yet maintain the all-terminal connectivity.

approach) 
D.  All-terminal Reliability (E-IPS approach) 
To obtain the all-terminal reliability for E-IPS, 
probabilities for different scenarios are calculated as follows: 
Scenario 0 (fault-free case): all links are operational (2N 
links for double ring) and all nodes (N nodes) are operational.  
The conditional probability of this scenario is given by: P(“all-
terminal connectivity maintained” | “all links are operational”) 
= [rn(t)]N [rc(t)].  Since P(“all links operational”) = [rA(t)]
2N, the 
unconditional probability of this scenario is given by:  
R0(N,t) = [rn(t)]N[rA(t)]
2N rc(t).   (7) 
Scenario 1 (single fiber cut): One link fails, all the other 
2N-1 links are fine, and self-healing is successful (CA = self-
healing coverage = conditional probability of successful 
  
  
542
healing after a link failure).  The conditional probability of this 
scenario is given by: P(“all-terminal connectivity maintained” 
| “one link failure”) = [rn(t)]Nrc(t)CA, since P(“one link failure”) 
= 2N(1-rA(t))[rA(t)]
2N-1, the unconditional probability of this 
scenario is given by:  
R1(N,t) = 2NCA[1-rA(t)][rA(t)]
2N-1[rn(t)]N rc(t).  (8) 
Scenario 2 (double link failures on a link-pair): two links 
on a link-pair fail, all the other 2N-2 links are working fine, 
and self-healing is successful.  The conditional probability of 
this scenario is given by: P(“all-terminal connectivity 
maintained”|“link-pair failure”) = [rn(t)]Nrc(t)CA.  Since 
P(“link-pair failure”) = N(1-rA(t))
2 rA(t)
2N-2 , the unconditional 
probability of this scenario is given by:  
R2(N,t) = NCA[1-rA(t)]
2 [rA(t)]
2N-2[rn(t)]N rc(t).  (9) 
Scenario 3 (Dual single fiber cuts on different link-pairs): 
two links fail on different link-pairs (failed links can not be on 
link-pairs connecting to the same node, otherwise this node 
would be isolated and all-terminal connectivity can not be 
maintained), all the other 2N-2 links are working fine, and 
self-healing is successful (CA = failure self-healing coverage = 
probability of successful healing after failure).  Since there are 
2N links on the ring, there are )N2(  possibilities to select 2 
links out of 2N links.  These 2 links cannot be between same 
pair of nodes (the possibility of such selection is N) and these 
2 links cannot connect to the same node from different sides 
(the possibility of such selection are 4N).  As a result, the total 
possibilities for selecting 2 failed links for this scenario is )N2(  
- N – 4N = 2N(N-3).  The conditional probability of this 
scenario is given by: 
R3(N,t) = 2N(N-3)CA[1- rA(t)]
2 [rA(t)]
2N-2[rn(t)]N rc(t).    (10) 
Scenario 4 (dual double fiber cuts on different link-pairs): 
four links fail on two link-pairs (failed link-pairs can not 
connect to the same node, otherwise this node would be 
isolated and all-terminal connectivity can not be maintained).  
Since the number of nodes is N, there are )N2(  possibilities to 
select 2 link-pairs out of N link-pairs.  Since the possibility of 
2 link-pairs connecting to the same node is equal to the 
number of nodes (N), the possibility of selecting 2 failed link-
pairs (4 failed links) for this scenario is )N2(  - N = 2
3)N(N − .  
The conditional probability of this scenario is given by: P(“all-
terminal connectivity maintained” | “dual double links failure 
on different link-pairs”) = [rn(t)]N rc(t) CA.  Since P(“dual 
double links failure on different link-pairs”) = 
2
3)N(N − [1- 
rA(t)]
4 [rA(t)]
2N-4, the unconditional probability of this scenario 
is given by: 
R4(N,t) = 2
3)N(N − CA[1- rA(t)]
4[ rA(t)]
2N-4[rn(t)]N rc(t).      (11) 
All-terminal reliability for E-IPS: R(N,t) = R0 (N,t) + 
R1(N,t) + R2(N,t) + R3(N,t) + R4(N,t) = [rn(t)]N[rA(t)]

IV. NUMERICAL RESULTS 
In this section numerical results are presented based on 
expressions derived in earlier sections.  For the constant 
failure rate case link/concentrator/node MTTF are chosen as 
106 hours.  Self-healing coverage factor CA is taken as 0.99.  
For the time-dependent failure rate case, shape parameters α 
are chosen as 0.5 and 2 (when shape parameter is less/larger 
than 1, the failure rate is decreasing/increasing with time).  
The scale parameter is chosen as 10-6 hours-1. 
In Figure 9, all-terminal reliability functions are plotted as a 
function of time using both the time-dependent failure rate (α 
= 0.5, α = 2) and the constant failure rate.  For n = 5, IPS leads 
to a greater reliability function than E-IPS for small mission 
times.  For larger mission times, the E-IPS reliability function 
surpasses the IPS reliability function (there is a crossover 
point where the E-IPS reliability function is equal to the IPS 
reliability function).  For n = 10/20/100, the E-IPS reliability 
function is always better than the IPS reliability function. 
We use the Mean Time to Failure and Mean Time to 
Failure Improvement Factor metrics to compare IPS/E-IPS 
reliability.  MTIF is defined as MTTFE-IPS / MTTFIPS [8]. The 
553
numerical results are shown in Table 1 (Exponential), Table 2 
(Weibull, α = 0.5) and Table 3 (Weibull, α = 2). 
As the number of nodes increases, MTTF decreases but 
MTIF increases.  MTTF and MTIF vary as a function of 
network size, component reliability (node, link, concentrator) 
and coverage factor.  The advantage of E-IPS over IPS is more 
obvious as network size increases.

In Figure 10, MTIF is plotted as a function of concentrator 
scale parameter (λc) for the time dependent failure rate 
assumption (α = 0.5, α = 2) and constant failure rate 
assumption (α = 1). We observe that the E-IPS approach leads 
to more reliable systems when compared with the IPS approach 
(MTIF>1) for a range of concentrator failure rate values.  The 
advantage of E-IPS degrades (MTIF value decrease) when 
concentrators get less reliable (failure rate increases).  The 
advantage of E-IPS over IPS is more obvious when network 
size is bigger and concentrator failure rate is smaller. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 10: MTIF as a function of concentrator failure rate (hour-1) 
In Figure 11, MTIF is plotted as a function of failure 
healing coverage (CA varies from 0.9 to 0.999).   It can be seen 
E-IPS gains more advantage over IPS as healing coverage 
increases.  In Figure 12, we compare IPS reliability functions 
for both the constant and time dependent failure rate 
assumptions (component MTTFs are assumed to be 106 hours 
for link, node and concentrator). Since MTTFWeibull =

shape parameter grows bigger, system reliability becomes 
larger.  In Figure 13, we compare E-IPS reliability functions 
for both the constant and the time dependent case (component 
MTTF are assumed to be 106 hours for link, node and 
concentrator). Since MTTFWeibull = 1)α

system reliability is better as shape parameter becomes bigger.

bigger, system reliability becomes larger.  In Figure 13, we 
compare E-IPS reliability functions for both the constant and

, λn = λA = λc = 2x10-6 1/hours for α = 0.5 and λn = 
λA = λc = 8.862x10-7 1/hours for α = 2.  The same observation 
can be made that system reliability is better as shape parameter 
becomes bigger.  If we assume that every component (link, 
node, etc) on SRP ring can be independently repaired then all 
reliability function expressions can be converted to system 
availability expressions. In particular, assuming steady state 
availability [9] for node an = 0.999999, steady state availability 
for link aA = 0.999999 and steady state availability for 
concentrator ac= 0.999999, the (steady-state) availability of 
IPS/E-IPS can be calculated as:  
AIPS = anNaA
2N + 2NCA(1-aA)aA
2N-1 anN + NCA(1-aA)
2 aA
2N-2 anN

rate assumption (black line for α=2, red line for α=0.5).  
It can be seen that for the parameter values chosen the E-
IPS leads to smaller availability values than the IPS.  To 
improve the availability of the E-IPS, we need to “improve” 
the concentrator availability (ac).  Table 5 lists the smallest ac  
value that is need to achieve AE-IPS > AIPS (an = 0.999999, aA = 
0.999999, CA = 0.99) .

40 >0.9900009871 
50 >0.9900009854 
100 >0.9900009710 
 
We can conclude from the above observation that larger 
concentrator availability results in better E-IPS availability.  A 
larger network can benefit more from E-IPS approach given 
fixed concentrator reliability.  Dual-homed nodes [8, 10] and 
"inner-outer" topology [7] can be used to enhance reliability. 
V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper we studied the all-terminal reliability of an 
SRP ring that adopts the IPS and the E-IPS mechanisms for 
fault-tolerance.  For this purpose, we analyzed all scenarios 
under which all-terminal connectivity is maintained.  The 
reliability function for each scenario is calculated.  By 
summing up expressions arising from individual mutual 
exclusive events, all-terminal reliability functions for IPS and 
E-IPS are obtained.  Under the assumption that component 
(node/link/concentrator) have constant or time-dependent 
failure rates, Mean Time to Failure (MTTF), and Mean Time 
to Failure Improvement Factor (MTIF) are calculated.  Results 
show that MTTF/MTIF vary as function of network size, 
component reliability (node, link, concentrator) and healing 
coverage factor.  The E-IPS mechanism is superior to IPS 
approach when network size is bigger and concentrator failure 
rate is smaller.
