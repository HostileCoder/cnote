Abstract—Both, adaptive antenna arrays for ISI cancella-
tion and non-linear hard limiter receivers are well known as
key technologies for high data rate low-cost receivers [1][2].
However, the combination of both technologies is a big chal-
lenge since non-linear receivers only provide phase or fre-
quency samples. The amplitude information, which is re-
quired for the adaptation of the antenna array, is not acces-
sible. Therefore, adaptive antenna arrays are most often ap-
plied in combination with linear receivers.
In this paper we present a new very low cost receiver which
combines adaptive antenna arrays and hard limiter receivers.
The training of the adaptive antenna array is performed on
basis of the complex channel impulse response (CIR), which
is estimated only by phase samples. The performance of this
approach is shown by means of simulations using a simple
hard decision device and Maximum Likelihood equalization.
Three decoding structures are compared: Optimum combin-
ing with hard decision, optimum combining with reduced state
Viterbi equalizer and a single antenna receiver with full state
Viterbi equalizer.
I. INTRODUCTION
Hard amplitude limiting receiver structures are known
as very low cost receivers. Compared to linear receivers
power consumption and hardware effort can be reduced
immensely. Due to the amplitude limitation the dynamic
range of those systems is minimized and no automatic gain
control (AGC) circuit is required. However, channel equal-
izing in digital domain is difficult for non-linear receivers
since the amplitude information is not available. Thus,
non-linear receivers are usually clearly outperformed by
linear receivers, especially in severe frequency selective
mobile communication channels. Smart antennas are known
as low cost technology for intersymbol interference (ISI)
cancellation in the analogue domain [2][3][4]. Up to now,
the training of the adaptive antenna array (Combiner) is
performed using linear receiver structures because an es-
timate of the complex channel impulse response (CIR) is
required.
In this paper a method to calculate the combiner co-
efficients on basis of phase samples is shown. Thus, a
new receiver structure, namely combiner with cascaded
phase detector, is able to compete even severe ISI situa-
tions (Fig. 1). The hard limiter is inherently included be-
cause equalization and channel estimation are based only
on phase samples. The complex weighting coefficients
of the adaptive antenna array are represented by ci with
i = 1..NA where NA equals the number of antennas in the
receiver. The receive signals are amplified (or damped),
phase shifted and summed up in the analogue domain. Thus,
only one receive chain is required. The resulting signal is
filtered by a bandpass prior to phase detection and sam-
pling. An equalizer can be cascaded to obtain the estimated
information symbols α. In combination with a Viterbi de-
coder a new class of space-time equalizers with different
degrees of complexity can be deduced. The performance
of these equalizers is shown by means of simulations.

{−1, 1}, yields the transmit sequence s. The rows of the
channel matrix X describe the NA multipath propagation
channels from the transmit antenna to the receive antennas.
The combined signal rc can be written as:
rc = cH · (Xs+ n) (1)
n is an additive symmetric white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
component with two sided spectral power density N0. The
resulting impulse response of channel matrix and combiner
is:
hTc = c
H ·X (2)
The received signal behind the bandpass filter hBP (k) is
denoted r and φr is the phase of the received signal. The
phase detector arg( · ) is assumed to provide a mod 2π
distributed phase signal.
Two types of decoders are investigated: a differential phase
threshold detector, where the ν-th symbol is decided with
ˆα[ν] = sign
{
φr[ν]− φr[ν − 1]
}
(3)
and a Viterbi decoder which performs a Maximum Likeli-
hood sequence estimation [7]:
iˆ = arg{max
i
p( φr | d(i))}
ˆα = α(i)
(4)
p( φr | d) is the conditional probability density function
and d is the complex desired sequence.
III. COMBINING
In this paper we investigate optimum combining (OC)
and examine the impact on the system performance in com-
bination with the cascaded equalizer. OC maximizes the
signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio S/(I+N). The com-
biner coefficients are given as:
c =
(
XXH + Iσ2n
)−1 ·X[:, kopt] (5)
σ2n is the variance of the symmetric complex additive white
Gaussian noise, I is the unity matrix and X[:, kopt] means
the kopt column of the channel matrix. The parameter kopt
is a synchronization parameter which selects the signal tap.
All other taps are considered as interference and are sup-
pressed.
The combiner coefficient optimization requires an es-
timate of the complex channel impulse matrix X for the
adaptation of the antenna array. Since the channel im-
pulse response is generally unknown in wireless transmis-
sion systems it has to be estimated.
IV. MAXIMUM LIKELIHOOD SEQUENCE ESTIMATION
The Maximum Likelihood sequence estimation (MLSE)
is performed using some idealized assumptions: The band-
pass is supposed to be an ideal bandpass filter. This means
the noise samples to be statistically independent and the
phase errors to be caused by an AWGN component. Fur-
thermore, the knowledge of the complex desired sequence
d is assumed . Then, the probability density function in (4)
can be factorized:

With (6) and (7) the MLSE can be evaluated using the
Viterbi algorithm [6].
V. CHANNEL ESTIMATION
Wireless LAN standards (e.g. HiperLAN) often apply a
known training sequence at the beginning of a data burst
for CIR estimation and synchronization. Non-linear hard
limiter receivers can estimate the complex CIR on basis of
phase samples of this training sequence as shown in [7]:
The training sequence (TS) consists of M consecutive m-
sequences. This leads to an M fold observation of the same
desired phase sequence φd:
φ(m)r = φd + φ
(m)
n , m = 1...M (9)
A phasor average yields an estimate ˆφd. The associated
amplitude sequence |d| is estimated based on the variance
of the observed phase values. These estimates yield a first
estimate ˆd1 of the complex desired sequence:
ˆ
d1 = | ˆd| · exp(j ˆφd) (10)
A subspace approach yields an estimate ˆhc of the complex
CIR:
ˆhc = arg

SBP is the convolution matrix of the transmitted training
sequence and the bandpass impulse response. The CIR es-
timation procedure can easily be adapted to the NA an-
tenna receiver by switching the antennas of the antenna
array. Note, the training sequence must be transmitted NA
times.
For Viterbi decoding according to (4) the complex sequence
d is required. A second, more precise estimate

VI. RESULTS
Three receiver structures are considered here. First, a
one antenna phase detection receiver without combiner and
with full state Viterbi decoder is examined. The number of
states is determined by the overall system memory which
is given by the memory of the bandpass, channel and trans-
mitter. With the MLSE approach from (4) this is a quasi
optimum decoder for the phase detection receiver.
The second structure is a three antenna receiver (NA = 3)
with combiner. Optimum combining is used to combat the
ISI of the propagation channel. A differential phase detec-
tor according to (3) is used for the decision of the symbols.
However, this structure suffers from the ISI introduced by
the bandpass filter which cannot be combated by the com-
biner.
Therefore, the third structure uses combiner and phase de-
tection with Viterbi decoder to equalize this ISI. The num-
ber of states is reduced compared to the first structure and
this way the complexity is reduced.
The performance of these receiver structures are exam-
ined by bit error ratio (BER) simulations. The curves are
shown over Eb/N0 which is energy per bit to noise power
density. For the three antenna receivers this is the mean
Eb/N0 of all branches. Here, MSK modulation and NA =
3 antennas are investigated. (The Trellis representation of
MSK can be found in [6].) The bandpass is a second order
butterworth filter with B ·T = 0.4; B the one sided 3dB-
bandwidth.
First the performance for an exemplary channel matrix X

is examined and compared with the performance of state-
of-the-art decoders. For a single antenna differential phase
detection (DPD) receiver all three channels are very criti-
cal. Fig. 3 shows the simulation results for the DPD with
Viterbi decoder and Euclidean metric (DPD+Viterbi) as
described in [1]. Obviously, this receiver fails and also
simpler structures without equalizer or with decision feed-
back equalizer fail in these channels. The reason for that

are high amplitude ¤uctuations caused by the propagation
channel. The special choice of X allows a very good re-
sult of the combiner combating the ISI. With cH = [1, 1, 1]
the resulting impulse response equals an ideal propagation
channel:
hTc = c
H ·X = [2, 0, 0] (13)
The results in Fig. 3 are achieved for this combining vector
which also implies a perfect channel estimate. As expected
the DPD with combiner (DPD+C) achieves good perfor-
mance. The single antenna receiver with full state Viterbi
and phase detection (PD+Viterbi) achieves better perfor-
mance: about 1.5dB at a BER of 10−3. Note, using 3 an-
tennas would increase the performance due to the diversity
gain. The gain of the reduced state Viterbi (PD+C+Viterbi)
is again 1.5dB at a BER of 10−3. As a reference the per-
formance of an optimum linear receiver with one antenna
(Linear optimum) is also shown. It achieves a gain of about
1.5dB compared to the best phase detection receiver.
The impact of the nonlinear channel estimation (according
to Section V) is shown in Fig. 4. The CIR estimates are
performed for each antenna separately by switching the an-
tennas. This means a 3 times longer training sequence (TS)
than for the single antenna system. With the system mem-
ory L the length of the training sequence (TS) in times of
the symbol period is:
NA ·M · 2L+1 (14)
In the simulations here L = 4 and M = 5is used and the
length of the TS results to 480 symbols. Since T-spaced
sampling is used at the receiver the number of samples for
the channel estimate is also 480 which means 160 samples
per antenna. The results show a loss of only about 1dB
and below for BER ≤ 10−3.
Experiences have shown that the quality of the CIR esti-
mate is essentially determined by the number of samples
of the TS. So, with a higher sampling rate the performance

of the receiver can be increased or otherwise the length of
the TS can be reduced without giving up the performance.
Finally, a more general channel model is used to examine
the performance of the receiver structures with combiner.
The taps of the channel impulse response are modeled as
randomly generated complex numbers with Rayleigh dis-
tributed amplitudes A and uniformly distributed phases φ.
The channel length is chosen to have 3 taps. The delay
spread DS is set to 0.5T . With the symbol period T the
taps of the channel matrix are given:

(15)
Fig. 5 shows the mean BER of this channel model eval-
uated for 200 channels at eachEb/N0. Again the combiner
with Viterbi outperforms the simpler structure. The loss of
the channel estimation compared to the BER with perfect
channel knowledge is up to 2dB for BER ≤ 10−3. The
performance of a linear optimum receiver and a differen-
tial phase detection receiver are shown as references. Of
course, compared to the complex optimum linear receiver
the performance of any phase detection receiver must be
worse. However, differential phase detection with antenna
combiner is a very low cost receiver structure that pro-
vides very useful capabilities also in severe ISI propaga-
tion. Compared to common nonlinear receiver structures

with differential phase detection or limiter discriminator
detection the coverage of the phase detector with combiner
will be much higher. As shown in the plot the differential
phase detector fails in these ISI channels. Also, with ad-
ditional (full state) Viterbi equalizer only a small perfor-
mance improvement can be achieved. However, the com-
biner structures –in particular with reduced state Viterbi–
outperform these common structures. Therefore, they could
be an attractive alternative to common expensive linear re-
ceivers.
