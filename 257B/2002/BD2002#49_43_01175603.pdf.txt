U. TRANSLATIONOFCOMFQUND NOUNS 
A. Compound N o m  andMachine ~nnrlntion 
The pmcsssing speed and availability of limidess memory 
space have made us to usc a large lexicon for natural 
language processing. No one would be surprised when they 
hear that the dictionaries for a MT system contain more than 
a h u n W  thousand word cnhies. Neverrheless, there arc 
occasions that such a dictionary bccomes useless in machine 
translations. The translation of compound nouns in Japanese 
offa an example: the nature of composing them maks it 
impossible for a dictionary. regardless of its size, to register a 
Jufftcient amount of compound nouns possibly used in an 
input ten to MT systems. It is fmsmting a fact and MT 
systems often d their incapability of properly translating 
compound nouns unngisterai in the dictionaries. 
For instame, f t B f i k E b t E V X P I  is a compound noun 
composed of four constituents or unit words. This in English 
means a writer's aid system or, when banslating it more 
directly, a syppOrr system for document generalion. But if we 
input this to a MT system, its output would probably be l i b  
document wention support .rys~n, as the word itself is not 
found in the dictionaries and as it p r o d m  the translation by 
mnratcnating the translations of each unit word in the 
compound noun: ftt(documnt%$&rcation)btE(mrt) 
V X t l ( s y s t r m ) .  
B. prwious Work 
The translation of a compound noun is o h  based on the 
compositionality principle (Nagao, 1996) and we see it use. 
for example. in Sasaoka et al. (1998) and Tanaka et al. 
(2001). This method w o h  h e  in some cases: tEH4@@! 
e bcwmm language i n f o m . o n  processing as B 3 
(Isnguage), *98  (information), and SB@mccssing). It 
reveals its ineflkclivsncss in many other instances, howenr. 
Som make use of corpora and scdtistical means to translating 
compound nouns. Along this line, Kaji et al. (19%) and 
Smadja et al. (1996) extracted translation of collocations 
h m  parallel corpora. Fung (1998) and Tanaka et al. (1996) 
put a similar effort with non-aligned cnrpom 
The corpus-based translation has pmblcms, tm. A 
compound noun may not be translated when it does not 
appcar in the corpora used In addition, even when it appsm 
in the co- thm always is the data-sparsmess problem in 
the statistical method, It may be vcy hard for us to find an 
equivalent in the target language corpus for a lengthy 
compound noun unless it has k e n  used frssuently as a 
common word. a pmpcr noun like the name for an institution, 
a jargon, and the like. 
In what follows, instcad of translating the compound nouns 
using large dictionaries or corpora, we propose a method for 
rewiting them into their equivalent phrilsal expressions. If 
WO arc succcssful in this effort, then a MT system is to take 
the rewritten expressions and translate the compound nouns 
into the target language. 
111. A METHOD FOR REWRnlNGCOMPOLJND NOUNS 
A compound noun is g e n d  to express a certain concept 
succinctly and it assumes a single syntactic unit as a noun It 
is coosidered to be a short hand for a lengthy expression. For 
instance, Tia???$ffEiE*$E consists of four constituent 
nouns: e-?i$r(administration), ???*(reform), BZ@rnmotion), 
and *#(headquarters). In its full expression this becomes Ti 
R d ? ? ? S b Z i  tdffEiEbZ+l expressing the meaning, 
heodquaners forpromoting Irdntnirlrution reform. 
Q 2002 IEEE SMC 
WA2E4 
We assume from an observation that certain inherent 
dcpmdcncy relations hold among the canstitumts of a 
compound noun and consider that the linguistic elements 
expssing the relations are omitted at the tim the compound 
noun was created. If we could supply the omitted elements, 
thm a MT systemmaybe able to translate a compound noun 
using its hrll expression or remitten form (the unit words 
with the padded elements) into the truget language. 
A. SmrcrurOl AM~YS~S of Conpound N o w  
We n a d  to find the i n h m t  relations to devise our method 
for rewriting a compound noun or rewnmucthg its full 
expression. To do so, we get the dependency of 
wmpound noun based on OUT previous work (was et al., 
2002). 
For a compound noun with its constiiuats, yy ...___ ....._ wm, 
we may bc able to 6nd a dependency relation that depmds 
on exprsxd as wI -, wl, using mutual infomation-lie 
metrics As is w e l l - h o w  mutual information is a standard 
way of estimating the s m g t b  of lexical association baasm 
any two wards (Church & Hanks, 1990). It is defined as: 
whm N is the sizc of the corpus used in the estimation, 
f (w, ,w,)  is the f i w m c y  of c o d c ~ m n c c ~ l  of W, and W, . 
and f (w, )  and f&) is the frequency of cach word

available to analyze the depcndencyrelations as it is cxp&tcd 
to makc the data spmeness pmblrm less p m b h t i c  than 
that in the use of other corpora' We then & h e  an Internet- 
b a d  Mutual Infomtion ( IMI ) as in formula (2) and use it 
to measure the strrngm of association bnwrm two wards

In formula (2). N denotes the Wtal number of the Japanese 
URLs registend in a search m+e. It is 42 million in OUT 
case.' hi<x) is the hit number we get when searching the 
word x in a search engine; < w, AND w2 > is a quny 
formula gotten by applying the Logid opetator AND to w, 
and w2 ; is the hit n u m k  when searching a 
compound word of the two constituent words wI and w 2 .

a concept that nprrscnts three classes of w o h  lime, 
Locatian. and OrgMkotion. We determine whether or not 
the tirst constituent word in a ampound noun, belongs to 
TLO, using the dictionary Matsumom et al. (2001) uses for 
chasm, a morphological analym. 
B. R m i n g  Compound Noum 
We rewrite a compound noun into a simple phrasal 
expnssion, using the r e d  fmm the dependency analysis. 
Flow ofthe nuUIod Figurr 1 shows the flow of OUT d o &  
We take as input the dependency relations among 
constitaents in a cMnpound noun. We then see the inherent 
relation or e x p s i o n  pattern each modifier and modified in a 
dspcndmcy relation holds. using a paucm table created in

linguistic knowledge.

of expression patterns for the original compound noun. 
Etpmsion pauerns brwrn bvo MUM Nouns in Japanese 
may be classified into the following 3 types, dep+nding on 
the funetions they may assume: 
1. Common noun (cnoun): normal one 
behaves like a vcrb with a suthx, b6. 
3. Adjectival noun (anoun): gcncraUy normal one; 
sometimes behaves like an adjective with a suffix, tt. 
Wih this knowledge. a relation between two types of nouns, 
A-B, may be &en as in Table I .  
Note that the "+" sign in fmnt of (A-tB) in Table 1 
implicates the inclusion of all patmns for A-tB. A. 0, I ,  S, 
G, L, or I indicates the ease the noun A in A+B takes in 
case gramnar for agent, object, imbument. source. god, 
lmm.on, orr*ne(Fillmore, 1968; Tanakadr Fmaki, 1975).

of the relation that holds baasm the nouns in the 
dependency relation A + B. bcfon assigning its 
comspond@g expression pattern. Here, we use the 
dictionary in Cham (Matrumom et al., 2001) to find the

Step3: Select rhc unit w& A, and B. dirosdy eombbd as the 
flllal sxprcssim. 
?he sewnd one in each pair of expressions in Step I is 
considered to be equivalent to the first one as the former is 
the inflected form of the latter. For instance, (AIITBL) is 
equivalent to (AflTBb a) as B L is the inflected form of B b  
a. 
In our proudwe, we first consider the case in which B acts 
as a verb. When B docs not occur as a verb. then it is 
considered to appear as a common noun. The reason to think 
this way is simpk: we more o h  scc the role of a w u n  in a 
compound noun that behaves like a verb. 
Generadon of ~ 3 4  q r m s b n  We d t e  a wmpound 
noun into its equivalent phrasal form after finding expression 
patterns for all (A-+B)'s of the compound noun. 
We make the phrasal expression wmbining expressions for 
all (A+B)'s h m  inner to outer, and IEA to right in the 
&pendency srmcture of a compound noun. Suppose, in an 
example, we have a compound noun of W ~ W ~ W , W ,  with the 
depmdency relations m Figwe 2. Suppose also we find 
expression patterm for (A+B)'s m it as: 
w, + w , ( w , @ w 3 b 5  ), 
w2 + W , ( W , t M t s W , ) ,  
w, -3 w,(w,afck50 w , h  
Then we get the combined expression for the conpund as 
(Wl@(W*nQk W , ) - 4 - 5 ) O l t & O  w,. 
- Y 2 2 5

Figure 3. Two Possible Derivations 
When Y in ( I )  is a vnoun and act as a normal noun in one 
relation and a verb in another, we need to consolidate the two 
expressions for X + Y and Y + Z. For instance, 
( x0f:ahOl Y ) and ( H i z  ), where Y is the vnoun and 
used as a normal noun in the first expression and a verb in

Y - + z  in (2). 
?he consolidation is necessary also when Y in ( I )  or Z in (2) 
acts as a verb and takes two different inflected forms in 
X+Y and Y+Z in ( I )  or X- tZ  and Y +Z in (2). Table 
2 below shows the consolidating des. 
(1) in Table 2 refers to the first derivation in Figure 3, and (2) 
the sewnd derivation. Conditions spenfy the forms to which 
the consolidations are to be applied. Tronsformations specify 
the wnsolidating rules for individual pattcrns in conditions. 
X+Y+Z is a combined expression where "+" stands for the 
padded words used to produce the combined expressions

IV. EWE- 
We examine how effcctive our method is by conducting some 
experiments, and then show their results with an evaluation 
A. TestData 
We select fmm Mainchi Newspaper'l994,' an annual vohune 
of a Japanese newspapz, the top 100 most utilized 
compound nouns for the lengtfi of 5. 6, 7, and 8 kanji 
characters. Afterdnrmwu ' 'ng their constituent suuctures and 
dependency sfructum by the system Han et al. have built 
(2001a; 2002), we use 88, 74, 66, and 64 instances of the 
compound nouns with 5. 6, 1, and 8 kanji-charactm, 
respectively, whose dependency relations have bxn 
successfully analyzea 
R. Experimem and Evaluations 
We feed the original compound nouns and their rewriuen 
expressions to a Japanese-to-English machine translation 
system The Honyahu Professional V7.03, one of the most 
powerful MT srjtrms in the &et

Table 3 compares the psrFomance of the MT system using 
the phrasal expressions with the one using the original 
compound nouns. The total instance h m  indicates the 
numbcr of mgisterrd mmpnnd nouns in the diciionary 
used in the MT systan. It is apparmt born Table 3 that the 
quality of translation h m  the phrasal exprcssions is not so 
good when the length of compound nouns is short and gets 
betta as the length bscoms longcr. A reason for this seems 
simple. The concatenation of unit words is effective when the 
length of compound nouns is short. But it docs not work 
well when the length gets longer. 
Table 5 shows another way of evaluating the performance of 
translations either from the original compound nouns or the 
rearriften expressions. Hm,  a means that the translated 
English is "acceptable", and na "not acceptable".' Table 4

V. CONCLUSION 
We have presented a method for rewriting a Japanese 
compound noun into a simple phrasal expression so thal 
machine translation systems may be able to come up with its 
equivalent expressions in the target language. The evaluation 
of the experimental results that followed indicates that our 
method is effcctive in impmving the translation of 
mgistered compound nouns.
