The great divide separating industries and companies 
within an industry is between those who are up shifting 
to real time supply chains and those who are not. Until 
today, very few organizations have succeeded in 
seamlessly integrating all levels of supply chain 
activities to achieve a quantum leap in business process.  
The ones that have succeeded are reaping big 
competitive rewards and offer us a window into 
netcentric business processes across the supply chain.  
This paper discusses some of these vanguard 
organizations and the important insights they provide us 
into the future.  An earlier version of this paper 
appeared in the Supply Chain Management Review, 
January/February 2001. 
 
1. Introduction: The Real Time Supply Chain 
In Motion 
 
 The following two cases represent the power of 
the real-time supply chain. 
 
Case 1 
A customer service representative in Atlanta 
turns to the computer to review an incoming order over 
the Web.  Is the product available to promise the 
customer?  The representative clicks the “search 
inventory" icon.  Immediately, a software agent 
interrogates the global inventory database, which 
includes not only its own corporate inventories in 
warehouses across the U.S., but those of its supply chain 
partners in Europe and Asia.  The software agent: 
• locates the necessary products and 
components the customer has requested. 
• calculates the guaranteed lead time to 
source and assemble these items. 
• calculates the most optimal transport route 
to the customer’s site. 
 
All of these transactions occur within 3 seconds. 
 
Case 2 
 
An importer or an exporter in Singapore has to 
get necessary approvals from 18 agencies that handle 
customs/trade approvals.  How long does it take for a 
shipper or freight forwarder to get those 18 different 
approvals? 
A trader can accomplish this by logging on to 
the island’s TradeNet, a 24 by 7 Internet-based system, 
making the request, and filling out the necessary on-line 
forms. The forms are then routed through eighteen 
different agencies simultaneously.  The whole 
permitting process is accomplished online within fifteen 
minutes. 
 
2. Driving Forces of the Real-Time Supply 
Chain 
 
The great divide separating industries and 
companies within an industry is between those who are 
up shifting to real time supply chains and those who are 
not. The real time supply chain business model is being 
formed, fundamentally shaped by the following three 
major technology trends: 
• Accelerating Connectivity and Broadband 
Networks Converging Voice and Data  
• The Transition To Smart Networks 
• Real-Time Total Asset Visibility 
 
These three major technology trends are now described. 
 
3.0 Accelerating Connectivity and Broadband 
Networks Converging  
Voice and Data 
 
Massive investments in fiber and satellite 
infrastructure capacities are leading to the doubling of 
speed of communications every three to six months (a 
forecasting rule known as Metcalfe’s Law).  In addition 
to increases in speed of communication, sheer volume 
of bandwidth is increasing exponentially.  For example, 
transatlantic fiber capacity expanded ten times between 
1998 and 2000.  Currently, we are verging on a 
bandwidth glut in key economic corridors.  360networks 
expects to have laid 56,000 miles of fiber on three 
continents within the year.  Global Crossing is installing 
97,000 miles of fiber on five continents; and Qwest is 
building a fiber optic network of 48,000 miles.  It is 
estimated that only 6.5% of installed fiber in the U.S. is 
presently even “lit” and used; the rest is dark fiber 
awaiting higher demand.1 This burgeoning availability 
of bandwidth is reflected in long distance 
telecommunications charges to corporate customers.  
The price of a call minute from the U.S. to Israel 
dropped from 32 cents to 8 cents over past three years. 
The emerging technological environment will 
be marked by massive bandwidth availability across the 
entire globe.  In addition to fiber networks traversing the

major economic corridors, low orbiting satellites, 
provided by companies like Teledesic, will offer 
wireless internet access anytime and anywhere at speeds 
up to one thousand times present day modems.  Core 
engineering obstacles to high speed Internet satellite 
delivery are rapidly being removed.  Recently, a 
Microsoft/Gilead Inc. partnership announced a 
technology for uploading data digitally via satellite, 
significantly bolstering the transfer rates and freeing 
users from the need to be tethered to land phone lines. 
Despite this emerging global massive 
bandwidth availability, constraints to fully exploit the 
bandwidth resource will probably not be completely 
eliminated.  These constraints will likely include:  
• Nation-state and bureaucratic interference with the 
user-community, with gateway access to bandwidth 
still subject to control and excessive rents by 
totalitarian or corrupt state telecommunications 
authorities.  The idealistic notion of the early 1990s 
that information wants to run free will remain just 
that- an idealistic notion- well into the future. 
• Persistent last mile problems, with the firehose of 
bandwidth meeting a needle-size lumen of 
connector devices.  The United States military 
today, with massive global bandwidth 
availability under mega-outsourcing contracts 
with telecommunications giants like AT&T, still 
has to strip away graphics from Power Point 
presentations when relaying data files to 
submarines at sea because of antennae 
limitations.  Imagine the situation if the military 
truly ‘informatizes’ itself and total situation 
awareness infiltrates every aspect of operations.  If 
present trends continue, the likelihood of crippling 
data jams or-worse- dangerous stripping away of 
crucial data to achieve some modicum of network 
throughput will be omni-present. 
 
4. The Transition To Smart Networks 
We are witnessing the following transition of 
software applications.  Software applications are 
moving from separate packaged software bought and 
installed on local machines and internal corporate 
networks to integrated suites of applications, managed 
remotely by 3rd party applications service providers.  
Application Service Providers (ASP), such as 
Digex, US Internetworking, Corio, and Exodus are 
leading the conversion of software to hosted 
applications.  These ASPs replace the customer’s IT 
infrastructure with the transfer of any applications and 
data onto the ASP servers.  All that is left on the 
customer’s site are the desktop PCs or terminals, 
connected onto a phone line or Internet connection.  
Typically, the ASP provides 24X7 customer support and 
ongoing system/ software upgrades, with charges based 
on the number of concurrent users and the amount of 
use by each user. For example, Corio will charge a daily 
user between $595 and $895 a month to access hosted 
applications over a wide area network; whereas an 
occasional user accessing applications over the Internet 
would cost only about $20 month. 
Software providers, such as SAP, People Soft, 
and Oracle are already hosting ERP modules remotely 
via ASPs. For example, USI’s suite of Internet managed 
applications include: financial management and human 
resources management software, powered by 
PeopleSoft; customer relationship management powered 
by Siebel Systems; and electronic Commerce, powered 
by BroadVision and Microsoft.   
The telecommunications providers whose 
bandwidth carries the data and supports the ASP 
networks and user-communities are positioning 
themselves to be part of this revolution in computing 
and Internet--based services.  Qwest signed a $500 
million deal with Hewlett Packard to equip Qwest’s 
CyberCenters with hardware and software to support the 
carrier’s forthcoming SAP/ERP outsourced service.  On 
June 28,1999, Qwest launched CyberSolutions, a joint 
venture with KPMG to develop application service 
provider hosting and management services for software 
such as ERP and Microsoft BackOffice Applications. 
GTE has collaborated with the Sun-Netscape 
Alliance to create its Network Commerce Platform.  
GTE bills the Network Commerce Platform as a “web-
based application rental platform for any hosted 
application.”  This system is an operating system and is 
application neutral with security features including 
digital certificates and user authentication.   
Currently, we see other major 
telecommunications players, such as MCI and AT&T 
directly entering into alliances with application service 
providers such as Digex and USInternetworking.  These 
telecom players are attempting to absorb software 
hosting services right into their networks, a transitional 
phase on the way to smart networks with on-demand 
intelligence and functionality. Other companies, such as 
Lucent, envision networks becoming “application 
switches” that enable users to source and use specific 
software functionalities from different ASPs on an as-
needed basis.  Thus, the smart network will sense when 
one ASP’s application servers are reaching overload and 
will automatically roll users over to another ASP’s 
application servers that have available capacity.   
A variant on this vision is extending the 
operation system and applications of one server via real-
time global satellite linkage to other servers in the same 
corporate network on the other side of the globe and 
snatching the remote server capacity.  This overall 
transition will continue so that there will soon be smart 
global networks with so much bandwidth availability 
that instant point to point connections can be 
established anywhere on the network and the 
delivery of as needed, customized data/and 
applications can be sped to users.   The direction and 
phasing of this software transition are shown in Charts 1 
and 2 found at the end of this paper. 
There are enormous challenges to reaching this 
vision of smart networks.  Domain support, sustaining 
200 millisecond transactions from a network

perspective, remains a significant hurdle; as does 
tracking and reporting different levels of licensed 
software services usage. But a concerted effort is 
underway to solve these issues. 
For example, Cisco has pulled together an ASP 
“ecosystem” of some 127 technology companies, 
ranging from companies that provide web hosting 
services, such as MSIA, to companies, such as Xevo, 
that have developed intelligent agents that migrate to 
desktops and monitor use of rented software over the 
net. 
In addition, Cisco is even reengineering its core 
product, IP routers, for the future smart networks.  Cisco 
is now embedding Tibco, Inc.’s middleware and real 
time messaging and publish-and-subscribe technology 
into its new generation of intelligent routers.  
Eventually, these routers will become business message 
traffic cops, extracting real time data from 
heterogeneous databases and dynamically addressing 
vital business data and messages to corporate users 
across the network.  
Such innovations can extend computing power 
and can offload complexity from in-house corporate 
managers and management systems to outsourcing 
specialists.  Nevertheless, the most significant danger of 
these innovations is the possible subversion of mission 
critical hosted servers by hackers intent on mischief or 
terrorism.  One can envision a scenario where hosted 
systems become slave systems under the control of 
intruders for short or extended periods.  
 
5. Real-Time Total Asset Visibility 
 
The ability to link and to effectively monitor, 
in real or near real-time, disparate remote assets and 
devices of all kinds, from inventory in-transit to sensor 
devices out on remote grids, is on the horizon and 
achievable in the short-run.  This ability will flow from 
the following developments: 
• Spread of  protocols for pervasive device inter-
communication and networking, such as Sun 
Microsystem’s Jini and Intel’s Bluetooth, enable a 
device to register itself on a network and update its 
location and systems status in real time  
• Spread of standards for industry-wide 
transactions processing, such as RossetaNet's 
XML consortium for the electronics industry or the 
Data Interchange Standards Association’s XML 
consortium for the financial industry.  
• Rise of new, integrated operating platforms for 
electronic processes, such as  proposed in IBM’s 
Supply Chain Development Initiative.  
• Rise of more reliable and cheaper radio 
frequency tags, Internet (I)-buttons and other 
field sensors.  For example, Dallas Semiconductor 
produces thermocron I-button devices today that 
attach to shipments of fresh produce and seafood.  
These devices take constant temperature readings to 
assess shipment safety and can be scanned and read 
by handheld devices. 
Taken together, these spreading protocols, 
standards, new operating platforms, and sensor 
technology will enable an organization to track and 
monitor highly distributed assets in real time.  This 
functionality will allow firms to rapidly reconfigure and 
deploy joint assets with extended enterprise partners and 
to conduct global transactions with less “friction,” e.g., 
less cost and time delays. 
Yet, it would be wrong to imagine this type of 
visibility as a process that will unfold in some 
automated or semi-automated fashion or as the result of 
one dominant standard or platform that will ultimately 
prevail.  Visibility will more likely flow from a series of 
highly labor intensive efforts to tag and inventory assets 
in the field and to connect them together with whatever 
evolving technologies seem most reliable at the time. 
 
6. Year 2001 Supply Chain  Business Practices 
 
Regardless of the IT architectures that are 
employed; or the application-level transport protocols 
(such as HTTP, FTP, etc.); or the basic message 
constructs (such as XML headers and MIME types), the 
need for underlying business process integration and 
system documentation of the rules governing that 
process integration will remain constant. The underlying 
business processes themselves will likely be transformed 
and will be radically different from those that dominate 
industries today.  
As massive bandwidth and the multi-media 
Internet transform the way whole industries conduct 
business, a fundamentally new set of business/ 
transaction processes and embedded system process-
descriptions/electronic business rules to support those 
processes will have to be developed.  RosettaNet calls 
these process descriptions “choreographies”. As Rick 
Drummond writes2: 
A simple choreography might be where a 
message is sent to a server and a response is 
received. These two messages together form 
the choreography of the transaction.  The 
complexity rapidly increases as the 
choreographies that must be supported 
increase.  The choreographies are often 
business sector-or application-specific so that 
only the people who know them well are the 
business process experts in that application 
and industry.  We see choreographies all the 
time in information gathering on the Web.  
More sophisticated transaction choreographies 
need to be supported, such as those used in 
Internet credit card purchase transactions, 
including, for example, issuing the request to 
buy, verifying the credit card, and confirming 
the purchase.  The shipping facilities are 
contacted and the product shipped.  However, 
the transaction is not completed until all of the

Worldwide Standard,” E-Business Advisor, April 2000.

above steps have been completed, perhaps 
over an extended period of time.  One of the 
most complex choreographies comes from the 
travel industry, where a single transaction may 
be composed of airline, car rental, hotel, and 
other bookings that occur across multiple 
industries and organizations. 
  
Yet, when we try to visualize such real time 
supply chain business processes and transaction 
choreographies, we mostly imagine a patchwork quilt of 
technology pieces and programs.  This is demonstrated 
in Chart 3 (found at the end of this paper).  Chart 3 
portrays how companies are cobbling together self-
service customer-order portals; ERP systems across 
internal processes; middleware links to disparate trading 
partner systems; collaborative planning/forecasting 
systems to aggregate supply chain community 
inventory/materials positions and requirements; and 
purchasing/auction portals to meet those aggregate 
requirements. 
 Until today, very few organizations have 
succeeded in seamlessly integrating all these technology 
pieces for quantum leaps in business process.  The ones 
that have succeeded are reaping big competitive rewards 
and offer us a window into netcentric business processes 
across the supply chain.  We shall discuss some of these 
vanguard organizations and the important insights they 
provide us into the future. As shown in the FedEx case, 
this will overturn our highly linear paradigm of supply 
chain operations and lead to a new webbed mode. 
 
6.1 Federal Express:  Simultaneous Processing 
Across An Extended Supply Chain 
 
Situational Analysis at Federal Express: 
 
• Army of portable bar code scanners feeding a 
centralized database 
• 400,000 customer service calls, 2.5 million 
packages daily 
• Business model dedicated to increasing speed 
of information and logistics flow 
• The FedEx-Proflowers Alliance 
• Massive available bandwidth can enable 
simultaneous, rather than serial processing, e.g.,      
      a single event will trigger multiple real-time 
actions throughout the chain. 
 
Today, Fedex is a leading model of 
simultaneous processing across an extended supply 
chain.  Federal Express employs real-time data 
transmission to assist in routing and tracking packages.  
Information recorded by portable bar-code scanners is 
transmitted to a central database and can be made 
available to all employees and customers, not just 
managers in traditional decision-making roles.  The 
FedEx corporate communications network is one of the 
world’s most sophisticated and most reliable, each day 
processing nearly 400,000 customer-service calls and 
tracking the location, pickup time, and delivery time of 
2.5 million packages. 
Federal Express is as much an information 
firm as a transportation company. Federal Express’s 
business model is now dedicated to: 
• increase transaction speed (single transaction 
triggers multiple enterprise actions) 
• connect systems and customers, globally 
• reduce costs (shifting processing burden to 
customers) 
• improve information control (available to 
employees, customers, and between customers) 
• provide solutions beyond the immediate business 
case (through re-engineering the supply chain, and 
alliance strategies) 
     
    The best example of how this is playing out 
today is the example of Fedex’s alliance with 
Proflowers.com , an internet company that runs a portal 
for ordering fresh flowers.  When Proflowers receives a 
web order, the Proflower webserver simultaneously 
records the transaction and messages FEDEX.  Based on 
this message, FEDEX generates both a shipping label 
(that is returned to the Proflower webserver and 
downloaded to the  grower) and a  request to its  fleet to 
pick up the order at the grower’s site. When the pickup 
occurs, the Fedex shipping label with all the requisite 
customer information is already on the carton of flowers 
to be shipped. 
In essence,  Fedex and Proflowers.com are 
using a single shared  trigger event, a customer order 
on the web, to generate multiple supply chain 
transactions.  This is a completely new paradigm of 
supply chain, a webbed model (rather than a 
sequential model based on serial handoffs) to attain 
quantum leaps in time savings and administrative 
processing costs. 
FedEx wants to develop global information 
systems for use by customers.  The systems will be 
integrated with customers’ systems so that customers 
will not know where their systems end and FedEx’s 
systems begin..  FedEx would like to develop a “real 
time information superhub”.  This information superhub 
will allow FedEx to use the information it collects and 
warehouses in an intelligent manner to foresee industry 
trends and to provide its customers with useful 
intelligence. 
   
6.2 Cisco:  End-to-End Internet Supply Chain 
Integration  
 
Situational Analysis: 
• Customer self-help.  Customers submit support 
requests on web site. They also can download 
software updates and diagnostics tools 
• Electronic Commerce.  Customers use web-based 
apps to price configure, validate, and order 
products. 
• Software Distribution via downloads from web site

• Expense Reporting.  Employees file expense reports 
electronically 
• Supply Chain Management.  E-commerce 
application notifies suppliers when incoming orders 
deviate from forecasts 
 
Cisco Systems has a profound mastery of  
supply chain and e-business processes utilizing the 
Internet.  Cisco has employed the Internet to reengineer 
processes across its whole span of operations and has 
become a global networked organization.  Every step of 
its supply chain, from customer order self-service/ 
product configuration to supplier management employs 
Internet-based processes.  This has worked so well that 
Cisco’s per employee revenue is almost three times that 
of competitors such as Lucent. 
  Cisco has reaped huge benefits from 
successfully and seamlessly integrating the fundamental 
technologies and components of the Internet on an 
enterprise-wide basis.  Further integration will occur as 
customer-order self-service portals; web-enabled  
“demand-driven” production and inventory 
replenishment processes; distributor/supplier 
collaborative planning/forecasting efforts, and online 
purchasing/marketplace exchanges, all come together 
into more seamlessly inter-woven supply chains.  
Today we are seeing only the very beginnings 
of such integration.  Take Cisco Systems as an example 
of early success in supply chain integration.  Cisco has 
used the Internet to lower its cost of doing business more 
than $560 million per year.  
It now receives more than 50% of its product 
orders via the Internet.  Its customers use 24-hour web 
based applications to price, configure, validate, and order 
products.  By automatically trapping errors at the 
configuration stage, Cisco has reduced orders that 
require reworking from 15% to 2%.  On the supply side, 
Cisco’s e-commerce applications automatically notify a 
group of suppliers when incoming orders deviate from 
forecasts.  By increasing responsiveness to customers, 
Cisco has been able to improve revenue capture by $100 
million annually.  By integrating suppliers earlier in the 
ordering process, the company has reduced lead times 
from an average of 40 days to 7-21 days.3  
Cisco has had to cobble together functionality 
and best of breed technology applications from providers 
such as Ariba and Extensity in order to attain their 
pipeline flow. Soon more integrated application sets will 
be available. Oracle recently unveiled its web-rewritten  
integrated ERP system 11 I  which is a first attempt to 
put a whole intermeshed suite of supply chain 
applications on the web.  
But integrated web-based supply chains are not 
only internally managed, as in the case of Cisco.  Hosted 
application suites, such as the Pandesic suite hosted by 
                                                        
3 Cisco Systems, “Building  A Global Networked 
Business”, January,2000

wide management to the web as an outsourced service. 
 
6.3 SUN Microsystems : The Network is the Supply 
Chain 
 
Situational Analysis:  
• Sun Peak network  links 50,000 employees, 
suppliers, and distributors 
• Sun Peak  is supporting $250 M supply chain BPR 
designed to cut 5 weeks out of 14 week product 
cycle time and 25% of the costs 
• The goal is a Virtual Merge.  Jini-enabled supply 
chains that automatically adjust assets, machines 
and inventories to real demand.rtual Merge:  
 
  Sun is  an industry leader in scalable servers 
to power PC Networks and Web sites. Of its $9.7 billion 
in revenue, 88% is server hardware sales.  Sun Peak, a 
Web-centric infrastructure (servers and Java 
workstations) links 50,000 employees, suppliers, and 
distributors.  Sun’s last mainframe was unplugged in 
January,1999.  The Sun Peak provides the foundation 
for future growth and flexibility to compete and serves 
as a demonstration of Sun’s role in networking.  It will 
help Sun transform itself to a net-centric way of doing 
business.  The new type of networking will allow Sun to 
reduce its planning and testing times and costs and 
move to a collaborative product innovation system 
based on rapid experimentation and correction off real 
market/customer data. 
There are many management challenges 
currently facing Sun.  First, it must master better surge 
management techniques to cope with volatility in the 
marketplace. They encounter 480% spikes in demand 
for a product from one year to the next.  Sun cannot 
simply be better at forecasting; the Sun supply chain 
must be better at adapting to real time demands on a 
chain-wide basis. One way that Sun has 
accomplished this is via a shared extended 
enterprise-wide data network and more 
collaborative relationships across the chain that 
exploit this available real time data. 
Thus, Sun Peak infrastructure is being used to 
support a  $250 million supply chain BPR project 
designed to cut 5 weeks out of 14 week product cycle 
times and 25% of cost. This reengineering of the supply 
chain is vital, given the speed and volatility of the high 
tech marketplace.  
Also underway is a plan to implement Jini-
enabled supply chains that automatically adjust 
networked assets, machines and inventories to real 
demand.  Once plugged into a network, a Jini-enabled 
device, with an address, can broadcast its capabilities to 
other devices in the network. Internally, Sun is 
attempting to use Jini  to implement a “Virtual 
Merge” functionality in the supply chain, or a real 
time synchronization of all components to arrive at 
the same time into production/distribution staging 
areas.

Other current Sun management challenges 
include implementing  horizontal process 
owners/incentives and spiral promotion policies so that 
workforce development and deployment can keep pace 
with the netcentric technology infrastructure being 
developed. 
6.4 The Automotive Network Exchange : 
Industry-Wide Process Design and 
Effectiveness 
Situational Analysis: 
• VPN/ Industry Wide real-time management 
infrastructure among automotive trading partners 
• Led by Ford, Chrysler, and GM and 3 dozen trading 
partners 
• Certified ISPs used to guarantee reliable connection  
 
The Automotive Network Exchange (ANX) 
highlights how real time networks are changing the way 
companies interact with each other not only across 
supply chains, but across whole industries.  As an 
industry-wide real-time management infrastructure, this 
virtual private network provides the medium for 
e-commerce and data transfer among authorized 
automotive trading partners.  ANX provides a common 
transaction infrastructure to handle computer-aided 
design (CAD) files, purchase orders, and payments in 
North America. 
ANX is the product of an industry-sponsored 
initiative led by Ford, Chrysler, and General Motors, 
working in concert with the AIAG (Auto Industry 
Association Group) and nearly 3 dozen automotive 
trading partners.  Participants in the ANX project 
identified four criteria that they felt were essential for 
their communications: These criteria are: performance, 
reliability, security, and management.  As is well 
known, the issues of reliability (servers that are down) – 
and performance (fluctuating transfer rates) are current 
serious concerns for users of the public Internet.  
 ANX was designed to be as secure as a Virtual 
Private Network (VPN); have an organization 
responsible for managing the transport of the electronic 
data, the ANX Overseer; and have a reliable 
infrastructure and a steady performance.  
 
7.0 ANX Design Issues And Solutions 
7.1 ANX  Performance 
 
A stable level of performance is a key 
advantage of ANX over the public Internet today, 
because transmission rates fluctuate in the public 
Internet. Highly synchronized production facilities 
require real-time data transmission and real-time data 
transmission can only be achieved with a network that 
offers a predictable performance. Organizations are 
asking for performance guarantees, like those that the 
telephone companies routinely provide.  The issue of 
data transmission performance is crucial for 
manufacturing companies that work in a Just-in-Time 
environment, where electronic data runs parallel to the 
physical transport of goods.  A company that connects 
to the ANX service may choose between different 
performance or bandwidth levels, starting from a 52 
KBPS dial-up line up to a 3 MBPS dedicated line. 
 
 
 
7.2 ANX Reliability 
 
Common problems for users of the public 
Internet are data loss or servers that are not accessible.  
Within the ANX community, “certified’ Internet Service 
Providers – the CSPs – are committed to guarantee a 
very high level of availability of their infrastructure and, 
thus, a high reliability.  They take the full responsibility 
for the data transport from one trading partner through 
the ANX “cloud” over to the other trading partner.  
Thus, trading partners do not need to worry about losing 
data as is happening on the public Internet. 
 
7.3 ANX Security 
 
ANX has addressed this problem with the 
adoption of the Internet Protocol Security (IPS) 
standard.  Within the ANX operating sphere, CSPs are 
allowed to exchange data only with other certified 
CSPs.  This ensures that no data is sent “unattended” 
over the public infrastructure. 
 
7.4 ANX Management 
 
Whereas there is no central management of the 
public Internet, the management of VPNs (Virtual 
Private Networks) is limited to a service provider’s 
customers.  This means that there is no single 
organization responsible for the management of data 
that runs across the secure VPNs.  
Within the ANX community, the ANX 
Overseer (ANXO) is the entity responsible for 
managing data that runs among the certified Internet 
Service Providers.  The ANXO additionally provides 
information to the trading partners about the 
performance and availability of ANX services.  
According to Forrester Research, “corporate extranets 
need a single-point management solution for all security 
options.”  This issue has been addressed by ANX 
through the ANXO function.  Additionally to these 
advantages, members argue that the service quality of 
the CSPs will be improved over time due to competition 
for the acquisition of trading partners.  
 
8. Anticipated Impacts of ANX Between Business 
Partners 
 
Direct savings of having ANX between 
business partners include: cost reductions through 
elimination of contract, billing, network management, 
equipment maintenance, and floor space overhead, 
through elimination of transaction-based charges for 
connectivity, through elimination of private lines;and

complexity reduction through reduced need for multiple 
providers to reach trading partners globally, and through 
increased compatibility. 
 
 
 
9. Summary Of Major Business Process Themes 
For The Real Time Supply Chain 
 
 The review of the pioneering organizations 
described above give us insights into the direction and 
character of the real time supply chain.. The major 
interrelated themes that emerge are the following: 
• Real time supply chain business processes 
capitalize on massive available bandwidth through 
simultaneous, rather than serial processing , e.g., a 
single event will trigger multiple real time actions 
throughout the chain.  As shown in the Fedex case, 
this overturns our highly linear paradigm of supply 
chain operations and lead to a new webbed model. 
• More seamless technology integration across supply 
chain activities enable the “straight through 
processing” of customer orders.  Customer self 
service portals are increasingly setting the pace for 
the whole supply chain and  providing clear real 
time market feedback and strongly  signal inventory 
requirements directly to the supply base. This has 
tremendous implications in cutting the costs 
generated by chain-wide buffer-stocking as hedges 
against unknown demand patterns, a syndrome 
known as the bullwhip effect. This is the 
implication of the Cisco case. 
• Real time extended enterprise architectures will not 
only permit new transaction efficiencies between 
trading partners, but also new strategy and product 
planning efficiencies, as the case of Sun implied.  
This is a very important distinction-not only the 
process but the product itself, it’s very design and 
evolving menu of features- will align with customer 
requirements more in real time. 
• Increasingly, the emphasis in business process 
design and performance effectiveness will move 
from an emphasis on the individual organization 
and its supply chain, to industry-wide process 
design and effectiveness.  This is the implication of 
the ANX case. 
 
10. Conclusions 
 
While the power of the real-time supply chain 
will revolutionize business processes in the coming 
years, there are some important overall conclusions 
about the path that we will take in realizing these gains. 
• In the transitional period to completely inter-
operable networks and applications, supply chain 
planners still require a middleware and real time 
messaging strategy capable of extracting from and 
linking disparate legacy, ERP, Internet and other 
data sources across the organization and its 
extended enterprise partners.  
• Second, an enterprise should be seeking to portal 
supply chain applications and services in a far more 
comprehensive manner than hitherto attempted.  It 
needs to migrate to an architecture of centrally 
managed servers and much thinner, more pervasive 
clients to gain greater situational awareness and 
distributed real time computing. This means senior 
supply chain managers need to establish a shared 
supply chain application service provider capability 
to support business units in a leveraged and 
efficient manner; to distribute new supply chain 
technology upgrades instantly across the network; 
and to maintain a single enterprise-wide supply 
chain deployment visibility. 
• Enterprises should be expanding discussions with 
global telecom providers and application service 
providers to ensure the availability of suites of 
hosted supply chain applications needed for its own 
distributed transactions. 
• While pursuing centralized portaling and hosting 
strategies, an enterprise must simultaneously focus 
on a massive diffusion strategy to the services that 
will enable the easing of the last mile constraints. 
Two way digital satellite-based  internet 
connectivity is one tool that can be employed in this 
strategy 
• While actively pursuing extended enterprise 
activities and linking to a range of industry or 
commodity-specific procurement portals to benefit 
from scale efficiencies in purchasing, an enterprise 
must nevertheless monitor the negative impacts of 
such activities on core suppliers to avoid 
endangering the critical supply base in pursuit of 
short term operational gains.
