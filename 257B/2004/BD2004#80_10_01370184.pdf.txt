Abstract— Oases are specific landscapes and play very important 
economic roles in arid Northwestern China. Yet, the peripheral 
ecological systems around the oases are equally important to the 
oasis economic systems in terms of protecting the oasis from 
desertification and ensuring sustainable development of oases. 
However, the rapid increases in the population and steady 
progress in the society and technology since 1950s have greatly 
expanded irrigated agricultural production in the oases, resulting 
in a dramatic decrease in stream flow and associated increase in 
the groundwater withdrawal in arid Northwestern China. The 
overexploitation of groundwater formed groundwater table 
depletion cones and eventually lowered the groundwater table 
not only in the oases but also in the periphery of the oasis, 
resulting in an overall decrease in soil water content. In response 
to the soil moisture decrease in the periphery, some plant species 
relying on groundwater resource have been dying out and other 
more mesic species have been replaced with more xerosere 
species. In this paper, the groundwater flowing processes and the 
water-table fluctuating processes during the past 40 years were 
simulated to obtain the spatial and temporal distribution of 
groundwater table by means of the GIS-assisted FEFLOW 
modeling based on the hydrogeologic data obtained in the Minqin 
Basin. Several conclusions can be drawn from the simulated 
results. First, the discharge and recharge of groundwater 
retained balanced and the groundwater table depth in the 
periphery area of the oasis maintained 2-3 m deep during 1960-
1965. Second, the utilization of the groundwater dropped the 
groundwater table within the oasis to 5-10 m, leading to the 
formation of big groundwater depletion cones that started to 
influence the groundwater table of the periphery area in the 
1970’s. Third, the further overexploitation of the groundwater 
within the oasis has dropped the groundwater table to 10-20 m in 
the oasis and 7-10 m in the periphery since the middle 1980’s.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Oases are specific landscapes that exist within deserts in 
arid regions (Jia et al. 2003). The oases in the arid 
Northwestern China take up only 4–5% of the total area of the 
arid regions, but, over 90% of the population and over 95% of 
the social wealth are concentrated within the oases. In general, 
oases located in the middle and lower reaches of the inland 
rivers are hydrologically supported by the river-recharged 
groundwater that lies within the underlying alluvial sediments. 
As a part of the arid Northwestern China, the Hexi corridor is 
also embedded with oases and the oases in the corridor have 
been playing very important political and economic roles 
during the past over 2000 years since Han Dynasty (Han, 
2001). However, the rapid increases in the population and 
steady progress in the society and technology since 1950s have 
greatly expanded irrigated agricultural production in the oases, 
resulting in a dramatic decrease in stream flow and associated 
increase in the groundwater withdrawal. Consequently, water 
resource has become an obstacle to the development of 
agricultural production, leading to an increasingly severed 
conflict between supply and demand of water resource. As an 
extreme example of the conflict occurring in the Hexi Corridor, 
the Minqin Basin that lies in the lower reach of the Shiyang 
River has been both economically and ecologically suffering 
from the decrease in the stream flow due to upstream water 
interception and local groundwater overexploitation. The 
surface water resource into the basin is solely supplied by the 
Shiyang River (one of the three inland rivers in the Hexi 
corridor), which is in turn supplied by natural precipitation and 
ice-snow melting in the Oilian Mountains in the eastern margin 
of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. Specifically, the stream flow 
coming to the Hongyashan Reservoir that supplies irrigation 
water to the Minqin oasis has decreased from 4.5×108 m3 to 
1.14×108 m3 due to upstream water diversion to irrigation (Gao, 
2003) and at the same time the irrigated acreage in the oasis 
has been greatly expanded. Consequently, the groundwater 
within the oasis has been excessively extracted since 1970, 
leading to the formation and expansion of the groundwater 
table depletion cones (E et al.1997; Ding et al. 2003). The 
coalescing of the individual depletion cones has not only 
drastically lowered the groundwater table within the oasis but 
also the groundwater table in the periphery of the oasis, 
resulting in an overall decrease in soil water content. In 
response to the soil moisture decrease in the periphery, some 
plant species relying on groundwater resource have been dying 
out and other more mesic species have been replaced with 
more xerosere species (Yang, 1999). As we all know, the 
desert plants distributed in the periphery of the oasis play the 
most essential roles to protect the oasis from desertification, 
meaning that the oasis economic systems have to co-exist with

the peripheral ecological systems in the Minqin Basin. In order 
to develop the strategies of retrieving the vegetation and 
preserving the oasis, this study is designed to investigate the 
groundwater flowing processes and the water-table fluctuating 
processes during the past 40 years to obtain the spatial and 
temporal distribution of groundwater table by means of the 
GIS-assisted FEFLOW modeling based on the hydrogeologic 
data obtained in the Minqin Basin. 
II. STUDY AREA 
The Minqin Basin (103°02’- 104°02′E and 38°05′- 
39°06′N), covering an area of 1.6×104 km2, lies in the 
lower reach of the Shiyang River with an elevation from 1310 
to 1900 m above sea level and the Minqin oasis is located in 
the center of the basin accounting for 6.9% of the total basin. 
The oasis, flanked by uninterrupted hills along northern and 
southeastern borders and scattered hills in southern border of 
the basin, is an irrigated agricultural system. 
Figure 1.  Location of the study area in the Minqin Basin 
The study area located in the plain of the Minqin Basin (see 
Figure 1), covering an area of 4017km2, has a typical arid 
continental climate with an average annual temperature of 7.6
℃ (average maximum: 30.7℃ in July and average minimum: 
16.8℃  in January) and an average annual precipitation of 
114.4 mm (1960-2002). Precipitation, about 80% occurring 
between June to September, is characterized by a high 
variability (a maximum of 185.1mm in 1973 and a minimum of 
42.2mm in 1962) with an annual potential evaporation of about 
2604.3 mm. The average annual wind velocity is 2.2ms-1 with a 
prevailing wind direction of NW (Yan, 1997).  
The study area slopes gently northward from 1400 m to 
1310 m above sea level with a mean surficial gradient of 0.05-
0.09%. The Hongyashan reservoir is situated at the southern 
end of the study area (The arc of AB seen in Figure 1 is the 
dam-base of Minqin reservoir, BC is the drainage divide of 
Minqin Basin, CD is the northern hills foot line, AE and ED is 
south-east border along the topography). In addition, two hills 
named Suwu Mount and Langpaoquan Mount outcrop the 
chalky limestone in the south and north respectively and do not 
participate in any groundwater processes. 
III. THE GROUNDWATER-FLOW SYSTEM 
A. Hydrogeological structure  
The borehole logs of the study area along the course of the 
Shiyang River investigated by Gansu Provincial Hydrogeologic 
Bureau (GPHB) reveal that the sequences of the sedimentary 
formation contain several superimposed sub-aquifers separated 
by semi-impervious or impervious aquitards and are comprised 
of Quaternary sediments of lacustrine sands, silts and clays. To 
implement our modeling effort, we simplify the hydrogeologic 
complex into two aquifers separated by a clay aquitard based 
on the findings of the borehole logs. The top hydrostratigraphic 
unit is considered to be a sandy unconfined aquifer up to 150 m 
thick in the south and to 120 m thick in the north. The top 
unconfined aquifer, intercalated with thin clay lenses that may 
give rise to localized perched groundwater bodies, is the 
dominant groundwater-withdrawing formation because 90 
percent of the wells are extracted from it for irrigation. The 
second aquifer underlying the 30-50 m thick clayey aquitard 
and overlying the Eocene formation has a thickness of 100 m. 
B. Groundwater flow system and the mechanisim of 
recharge and discharge  
The Hongyashan Reservoir dammed the Shiyang River in 
1960, and the artificial channels have replaced the natural 
channels since 1961 in the Minqin oasis. The seepage flow 
runs along the gravity gradient with a N-S direction. The 
recharges into the aquifer of the Minqin Basin include 
horizontal lateral flux from the south aquifer and vertical 
infiltration from the rainfall and the seepage from irrigation 
water. The amounts of the vertical infiltration from the rainfall 
decrease with the withdrawal-caused water-table decline. For 
example, the average infiltration rate is 16.8 mm·a-1 when 
groundwater table depth is less than 5 meters, while the rate is 
0 mm·a-1 when the depth is more than 5 meters (Ma, 2002). The 
sum of infiltration from irrigation water is calculated to be 
3.0×108 m3 in 1960-1965, 2.6×108 m3 in 1970, and 2.2×108 to 
1.8×108 m3 from 1980 up to now. Investigations by GPHB 
revealed that the lateral flux through the dam-base is around 
6.0×106 m3a-1. The lateral flux from the southern aquifer is 
about 4.0×107 to 5.0×107 m3a-1. 
The water discharges include actual evapotranspiration 
from the shallow unconfined groundwater, the net withdrawal 
of groundwater and some lateral discharge outputs. The 
evapotranspiration is directly related to the depth of the 
groundwater table. For example, the evaporation is 148 mma-1 
when the groundwater table ranges between 1 to 3 m, while it 
becomes 17 mma-1 when the groundwater table ranges between 
3 to 5 m and 0 mma-1 when the groundwater table is more than 
5 m. The pumping of groundwater began in 1965 in the Minqin 
Basin, but the number of pumping wells increased dramatically 
from 1970 to 1979 and reached 7000 and has maintained 
unchanged 8000 since 1980 (see Table 1). The wells are 
irregularly distributed within the oasis. In addition, the 
pumping wells have been deepened from 20～30 m to 60～150 
m in the past 40 years. It should be noted that the lateral 
discharge out of the study area might be negligible considering 
the decline of groundwater table (Ma, 2002). The budget of 
groundwater (see Table 1) was calculated for Model designing.

IV. METHODOLOGY  
A. Numerical model and design of boundary conditions 
The employed numerical model is FEFLOW, a finite 
element code based on the general three dimension (3D) form 
of the governing differential equation for flow in 
heterogeneous isotropic media, allowing for the usual Dirichlet 
(specified head) and Neumann (specified flux) boundary 
conditions (Beckers, 2001). The Bouseeinesq differential 
equation described below is the principal functions in it.

Where H is the saturated hydraulic head [L], h is the water 
table elevation above the impermeable barrier [L], H0 is the 
initial hydraulic head [L], q is the flux to recharge [LT-1], K is 
the hydraulic conductivity [LT-1], μis the specific yield, W is 
the water balance, i.e., discharge minus recharge [LT-1], D is 
the study area, Г2 is the second kind boundary condition, t is 
time [T] and n is the normal direction.  
The model of FEFLOW is composed of three parts: 1) The 
designation of finite element mesh; 2) 3D designation of slices 
and layers; and 3) Problem editor to specify the parameters 
needed for simulation. 
Figure 2.  Finite element meshes in horizental plane. 
The model area is divided into 18051 mesh elements 
containing 12376 mesh nodes. The meshes are refined in the 
oasis to consider the highly varying hydrogeological properties 
of oasis (see Figure 2). To consider the vertical variability in 
the hydrogeological properties for 3D simulation, the formation 
is simplified into 2 aquifers separated by a clay aquitard as 
described above. The real world z-elevation of 4 slices of the 3 
layers was defined respectively in the DATA 
REGIONALIZATION function on the basis of the modeling-
area digital elevation model (DEM) prepared in ARCVIEW. 
The necessary data for each slice of the 3 layers were assigned, 
i.e. flow initial conditions such as hydraulic head, flow 
boundaries such as the second and fourth kind boundary 
conditions, and flow materials such as hydraulic conductivity, 
specific storage coefficient and porosity of the formation. 
Figure 3.  Distribution of groundwater table depth in 1960 
The initial hydraulic head of groundwater surface in 1960 
was assigned (see Figure 3) by means of interpolation of 
imported so-called ‘triplets file’ function. The second kind 
boundary condition (Neumann) was adopted in the model (see 
Figure 2) where AB with 0.08219 md-1, AE with 0.01369 md-1 
of flux and BC-CD-DE with zero flux. The fourth kind 
boundary condition (wells), which is the net consumption that 
causes the drawdown of groundwater table, was assigned from 
1960 to 2000 according to the Time-varying Power function 
that can edit or import the net groundwater consumption rate 
data (Table 1). The net consumption was calculated based on 
the budget of recharge and discharge. It should be noted here 
that in terms of discharge, the evapotranspiration dominated the 
earlier period while the groundwater pumping later period. The 
saturated conductivity and storativity (drain/fillable porosity) 
of 3 layers (upper aquifer, aquitard and bottom aquifer) were 
assigned respectively in the Flow Materials Function, in which 
the parameters of flow materials derived from the borehole 
logs investigated by GPHB were prepared in ARCVIEW. In 
order to calibrate the model, the data of 28-referenced 
observation points (wells) in refined area of the oasis were 
utilized. 
After assigning all parameters needed for simulating, we set 
the constant time of 480 steps with the step length of 30 days. 
B. Calibration of the mode 
The calibration of a complex groundwater model is 
normally a time-consuming but an essential task (J. Beckers

and E. O. Frind, 2001). Modeling calibration is the process of 
adjusting model parameters and comparing the results until 
calculated head values closely match the recorded values 
within a pre-established range of error at selected points of the 
upper aquifer (Roger González-Herrera, 2002). 
In this study, the data of 28-refenrenmced observation wells 
recorded from 1982 to 2002 with monthly resolution was used 
to compare with the simulated groundwater table depth through 
adjusting the following parameters: the recharge flux of the 
second kind boundary condition, the time-dependent amounts 
and distribution in the Minqin oasis of pumping groundwater, 
and the flow materials of saturated conductivity and the 
storativity (drain/fillable porosity) by trial and error. 
Figure 4.  Distribution of groundwater table depth in 2002 
The distribution of simulated groundwater table depth in 
2000 (14400th day) was shown (see Figure 4) and the average 
error of simulated value is 0.5 m in comparison with the 
observed data (See Fig. 5).

simulated values in the selected 5 wells: ······Observations, —— simulations. 
V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
The development of the Minqin oasis through pumping 
groundwater has been impacting the ecosystem of its periphery 
region and is going to threaten the safe existence itself. The 
simulation of groundwater table for the periphery of the oasis 
where there are little observed records available makes it 
possible to quantitatively investigate the relationship between 
the drawdown of groundwater table and the vegetation 
degradation in the arid inland river regions. Several preliminary 
conclusions can be drawn from our simulation. First, the 
discharge and recharge of groundwater retained balanced and 
the groundwater table depth in the periphery area of the oasis 
maintained 2-3 m deep during 1960-1965. Second, the 
utilization of the groundwater dropped the groundwater table 
within the oasis to 5-10 m, leading to the formation of big 
groundwater depletion cones that started to influence the 
groundwater table of the periphery area in the 1970’s. Third, 
the further overexploitation of the groundwater within the oasis 
has dropped the groundwater table to 10-20 m, causing the 
groundwater depletion cones to reach the periphery of the oasis 
and the groundwater table of the periphery has been 
consequently lowered to 7-10 m below the surface since the 
middle 1980’s.
