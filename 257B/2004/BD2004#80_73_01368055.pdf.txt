Abstract-A 2 A  modulator designed specifically for 
extended temperature applications is reported. The design is 
fabricated in a 3.3-V 0Spm SOS-CMOS process and 
incorporates a 2-2 cascade architecture allowing operation as 
either a 2"'- or 41h-order modulator. Experimental data for 
both modulator configurations are presented including 
dynamic range (or effective resolution), signal-to-noise ratio 
and total harmonic distortion over a temperature range of 
25°C to 225°C. The design obtains an effective resolution of 
-16 bits at 25°C and -12 bits at 225"C, both at a digital 
output rate of 2KS/s. Specific design details associated with 
high temperature operation are discussed including 
architectural issues, device sizing, and modulator noise. In 
addition, a digital decimation filter designed for use with the 
modulator and implemented in both software and in a field 
programmable gate array is summarized. This paper reports 
the first 4~-order XA modulator fabricated in an SOVSOS 
process and demonstrates the feasibility of high resolution 
data conversion at elevated temperatures.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Recent advances in integrated circuit fabrication 
technologies and in temperature-tolerant circuit architectures 
have enabled true precision measurements in extreme 
environments. In particular, engine exhaust monitoring 
(both internal combustion and jet engine), seismic 
exploratiodwell management, and satelliteispace flight have 
emerged as three of the most temperature demanding 
monitoring applications currently facing industry [l-31. 
One of the most common functional modules in any sensor 
interface is the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Of the 
many different circuit topologies employed for analog-to- 
digital conversion, only sigma delta (XA) based methods 
have shown significant promise for precision high 
temperature operation. XA methods incorporate 
oversampling and noise shaping and consequently provide 
improved resolution over Nyquist-rate conversion methods 
by trading component accuracy for time. This inherent 
property of oversampled converters makes them ideal for 
high-temperature applications since component errors and 
drifts associated with elevated temperature are well tolerated 
compared to other analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) 
techniques. 
Several papers have been published on 2 A  modulators 
implemented in Silicon-On-Sapphire (SOS) or Silicon-On- 
Insulator (SOI) for high-temperature or radiation 
environments 14-61. Though significant, these reported 
designs implement 2"d-order noise shaping and produce at 
best 13 bits of resolution. This research addresses the need 
to extent the obtainable resolution of XA ADCs fabricated in 
SOVSOS for high-temperature applications and reports the 
first 4Ih-order modulator architecture fabricated in SOS/SOI. 
2. MODULATOR ARCHITECTURE 
The modulator reported was designed with special 
consideration for high-temperature operation [3]. Though 
cascade topologies do present some disadvantages when 
compared to single-loop structures, namely reduced input 
dynamic range and matching errors, the topology composed 
of two Znd-order loops is inherently stable. In addition, 
single-loop modulator architectures allow for more straight- 
forward implementation of the digital decimation filters, but

require proper initialization, monitoring and compensation to 
ensure robust stability. For these reasons, a 2-2c cascaded 
architecture was selected. The classical integrator gain was 
implemented since it has been shown to be less sensitive to 
matching errors as comparcd to alternative gain selections 
that minimize the requircd integrator output swing. The 2-2c 
modulator architecture is shown in Figure 1.

correlated double sampler 
3. INTEGRATOR AMPLIFIER 
The integator amplifier is the most critical functional block 
of the modulator as it detennines the integrator performance 
and dominates the input-referred electronic noise of the 
modulator. A fully differential architecture was implemented 
for rejection of common-mode noise and offsets. Preliminay 
simulations and SOS MOSFET device measurements 
indicate that either a multi-stage topology or cascoded 
topology is required to obtain open loop dc gains on the 
order of 2000. Multi-stage topologies require more than one 
common-mode feedback loop (CMFB) and are typically 
more difficult to compensate than single-stage structures [6]. 
Conversely, a folded cascode topology produces high loop 
gain, requires a single CMFB loop, and is more easily 
compensated. Disadvantages of this architecture include 
increased input-referred noise and limited output swing due 
to the cascode devices. However, the stability advantages of 
the folded cascode over multi-stage topologies make it more 
desirable for wide temperature application. 
A schematic of the fully-differential folded cascode amplifier 
is shown in Figure 2. Continuous-time CMFB was 
incorporated to allow use in both sampled- and continuous- 
time applications. The output of the amplifier is buffered 
using source followers made of intrinsic devices (-zero 
threshold voltage) and the common-mode voltage determined 
using a resistance divider. The CMFB loop compares this 
voltage to a CMFB reference and controls the load devices 
M9 & M10 to maintain the output at the desired common- 
mode level. A modified wide-swing cascode biasing is used 
throughout to provide maximizcd output swing and precise 
bias setting [7,8]. The bias circuit for the amplifier is shown 
in Figure 2 and incorporates feedback loops formed by 
MB8MB9 and ME417iMB18 to ensure the cascode devices 
MIO, M12, M14, and M20 remain in saturation over a wide 
range of temperatures.

4. DIGITAL DECIMATION FILTER 
The decimation filter designed for use with the 2 A  modulator 
is shown in Figure 4. The filter implements a novel 
architecture allowing use with both single loop architectures 
and cascaded architectures. The decimation ratio is 256, and 
the maximum resolution is 24 bits. As Figure 4 shows, the 
decimation filter is made of two FIR filters, the noise- 
cancellation filter, and a sinc filter with the decimator. The 
FIR filter is designed as a one-bit-input FIR filter using 
adders only, allowing operation at the oversampling 
frequency. The primary purpose of the FIR filter is to correct 
the droop caused by the 4"-order sinc filter as well as to add 
to the total filter out-of-band attenuation. The goal in this 
design was to have the pass-band ripple less than 0.02 dB, 
while maintaining sufficient stop-band attenuation to 
suppress the out-of-band quantization noise of a high- 
resolution modulator. 
The FIR filters from Figure 4 have an order of 4096 and are 
composed of 64 non-zero taps padded with 64 zero-taps. 
2 
2609 
The non-zero tap values were determined using the Remez 
exchange algorithm in Matlab. 64 zero-taps were inserted 
between thc filter taps to generate a comb-like filter whose 
structure is shown in Figure 5. Each shift register is one bit 
wide allowing multiplier-free implementation. The filter taps 
are 12-bit precision and produce a 15-bit wide data path at 
the output of the filter. The magnitude response of the filter 
was simulatcd using Matlab and is shown in Figure 6.

L y [ n l  
Figure 5 -FIR filter structure 
The sinc filter of Figure 4 is a 4Ih-order sinc filter followed 
by decimation. The most effective implcmcntation of the 
filter is an integrator-decimator-differentiator structure as 
shown in Figure 8. The decimation factor M is 256, and it is 
equal to the oversampling ratio of the modulator. 
As elaborated in [SI, to avoid overtlow the datapath size in 
the sinc structure needs to be 
b>log,[(M*+l)]+c>53 (1) 
where b is the number of bits in the datapath, M=256 is the 
decimation ratio, k=4 is the sinc order, and c=Zl is the 
nurnbcr of bits input to the sinc filter from the noise 
cancellation filter. A number of the least significant bits 
from (1) can be dropped depending on the modulator's 
practical dynamic range.

The noise cancellation filter of Figure 4 is required when the 
filter is used with cascaded EA modulators composed of 2 
single-bit loops [7]. Most commonly, this filter is placed 
before the decimation filter which consequently requires 
multi-bit multiplication in the decimation filter. The 
topology presented in this work partitions the filter, placing 
the noise cancellation function following the FIR function. 
This topological improvement reduces the overall filter 
implementation complexity and allows higher signal 
bandwidths. The noise eancellahon filter block diagram is 
shown in Figure 7. The inputs are 15-bits wide and the filter 
produces a 21-bit result. 
Figure 8 - 4Ih-order sinc filter with a by-M decimator 
Figure 9 shows the total impulse response of the filter 
without decimation. The filter exhibits an increase of 
2OdBioctave in stop-band attenuation making it most 
effective at rejecting the quantization noise furthest away 
h m  the baseband where the most of the noise power is 
located. Lower attenuation at fiequencies closer to the 
baseband is sufficient since the quantization noise power at 
these frequencies is very low. Note that the nulls of the sinc 
function have been placed to maximize attenuation of the 
baseband images of the FIR filter. 
As shown in Figure IO,  the simulated total pass-band ripple 
for the decimation filter is less than 0.015 dB which is much 
better than the pass-band ripple in most commercial, low- 
temperature ADCs. Figure I 1  shows the simulated 3dB- 
bandwidth of the filter which is approximately 1 kHz for the 
decimated sampling frequency of 2.4 kHz.

The decimation filter was first implemented in a Xilinx 
XC4062XL.A-09-HQ240 FPGA as an intermediate step in an 
effort to design a high-resolution, high-temperature ZA AID 
converter ASIC [9]. The shift register from Figure 5 was 
designed as a 4096-hit long, one-bit wide FIFO using FPGAs 
distributed RAM controlled by an address counter. Since the 
impulsc response of the F I R  filter is symmetric, the one-bit 
multiplication with the 12-bit filter taps was implemented as 
a multiplexer. 
Besides the decimation filter core, a number of additional 
blocks were implemented to allow filter configuring and self 
testing. Interfacing to the filter is accomplished using an SPI 
port that allows access to a number of configuration and 
statu registers. The entire FPGA implementation required 
2,727 flip-flops, 2,485 4-input lookup tables, and 637 3-input 
lookup tables which represented 80% of the FPGA 
resources. Testing of the FPGA code was performed using a 
generic board containing two XC4062XLA FPGAs and 
interface circuitry to communicate with a PC running a 
LabVIEW CUI. The filter can operate using input data from 
either an external modulator or a pre-stored modulator filc. 
Thc output of the filter is stored to the PCs hard drive, 
analyzcd, and displayed using the LabVIEW GUI. 
Figure 12 shows the simulatcd output of the decimation filter 
with an input data stream acquired from an Analog Devices 
AD1555 modulator (full-scale input signal, f = 240 Hz). 
Figure 13 shows the output of the PGA-implemented 
decimation filter under the same test conditions. As 
demonstrated in Figures 12 and 13, excellent agreement 
between the simulated and experimental results was 
observed. Furthermore, the calculated SNRs in both cases 
were identical.

5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
The modulator and digital filter designs were fabricated as 
separate integrated circuits in a 0.5p.m SOS-CMOS process 
available through MOSIS. Photographs of these two custom 
chips are shown in Figures 16 and 17. The modulator ASIC 
incorporates the circuits of Figure 1 plus clock generation 
circuitry and buffer amplifiers to enable off-chip monitoring 
of each integrator output. The digital filter ASIC was 
designed using a mixture of standard cell and custom layout 
techniques. To minimize silicon implementation area, the 
FIR shift registers were implemented as custom-designed 
SRAM cells controlled by a set of counters. The noise 
cancellation and sinc filter chip layouts were also custom 
designed to reduce the chip area. Only the SPI circuihy was 
synthesized directly from VHDL using standard cells. 
Testing of the digital filter ASIC produced the same results

fabricated in 0 . 5 ~  SOS-CMOS 
Figure 18 shows the measured open loop response of the 
integrator amplifier as a function of temperature from 25°C 
to 200°C with 20pF load capacitance. Table 1 summarizes 
the preliminary results of the testing. These results indicate 
very little degradation of the amplifier open loop gain with 
increasing temperature. Maintaining high loop gain is 
important at all temperatures to prevent excessive noise 
contribution from secondary integrators in the modulator 
loop. 
A multitude of tests were performed on the modulator as a 
function of temperature and input amplitude using a custom- 
designed test setup. The chips were tested from 25°C to 
225°C with a low-noise input sine wave of 36.6Hz and 
5

144Hz. The measured output spectrum of the modulator is 
presentcd in Figurcs 19-22. Figures 19 & 20 show the room 
temperature output spectra as a function of input amplitude 
for the modulator configured as 2"d and 4Ih order, with CDS 
disabled, and with CDS enabled. Each FFT is calculated 
from -lM points and the spectra shown represcnt an averagc 
of 8 runs. Figures 21 and 22 show the output spcctra as a 
function of temperature for a fixed input signal amplitude of 
-3dB. Note the increase in thc noise floor with increasing 
temperature.

At each temperature the SNR and THD were calculated as a 
function of input amplitude and are presented in Figures 23 
and 24, respectively. Test results indicate decreased peak 
S N R  with temperature as expected. However, this is the 
result of increascd electronic noise [IO] and not quantization 
noise shaping as demonstrated by both the measured dc gain 
of thc integrator amplifier and observed slope of the shaped 
quantization noise at high temperature. In addition, the THD 
calculations indicate increased distortion with both increased 
input signal level and temperature, as expected. The 
measured dynamic range (DR) of the modulator as a function 
of temperature is shown in Figure 25, for both 2"d and 4Ih 
order modulators with the CDS enabled and disabled. A 
summary of test data for the modulators over a range of 
temperatures is shown in Table 2.

Overall testing indicates that low-frequency noise reduction 
is accomplished using CDS but this techniqucs provides 
limited benefit in this case due to the increase of the white 
noise associated with this operation. In addition, the low 
frequency reduction due to CDS appears to increasingly fail 
for temperatures above 175°C as noticed by the l/f noise 
creep in the output spectrum. The reason for this 
phenomenon is not obvious and will require M e r  
investigation. However, the use of CDS will provide 
significant improvement in dynamic range over a system 
without CDS for smaller signal bandwidths than shown in 
this paper. 
6. CONCLUSIONS 
This work represents the first presentation of both 2"d- and 
4Ih-order EA modulators in SOVSOS and demonstrates the 
feasibility of high-resolution data conversion in SOS using 
2 A  techniques at elevated temperatures. SNR, THD, and DR 
data were presented over a temperature range of 25°C to 
225°C. Over the entire temperature range, the measured 
modulator performance indicates that the design is input- 
noise limited and improved performance can he obtained 
with better noise management. The use of CDS in this 
design provided no improvement in performance with a 
digital output rate of 2k sampleshecond. However, 
significant improvement in performance over systems 
without CDS can be obtained up to -175°C if lower DO% 
are used. The high flicker noise contribution of the MOS 
devices in SOS processes certainly imposes dynamic range
