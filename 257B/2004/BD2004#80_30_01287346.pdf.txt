Abstract
Due to overall popularity of the Internet, e-learning 
has become a hot method of learning in recent years. 
Through the Internet, learners can freely absorb new 
knowledge without the restriction of time and place. 
Many companies have adopted e-learning to train their 
employees. The e-learning system can make an 
enterprise more competitive by increasing the 
knowledge of its employees. As we know, e-learning has 
become one of the most potential e-commerce 
businesses. 
At present, most e-learning environment 
architectures are in consideration of a single computer 
or server as its erecting foundation. As soon as its work 
load increases, the software and hardware need to be 
updated or renewed; this is a big burden to a company 
with insufficient budget. Thus, in this research we 
employ a kind of Grid Computing technology, called 
“Access Grid”, to integrate the idle computer resources 
in an enterprise into an e-learning platform for 
substituting the purchase of costly high-level server and 
equipment.   
The Access Grid supports group-to-group 
communication via high-speed networking over the 
Internet. It provides high quality audio and real-time 
video interactive interface for e-learning users. All the 
hardware cost is reasonable so that companies or 
academies can easily set up their own Access Grid 
Node. By using Access Grid technologies, enterprises 
can integrate their training materials into knowledge 
repository such as “Data Grid” as the e-learning VOD 
platform so that the knowledge can be shared and 
published more flexibly and widely.

1. Introduction 
With the development in communication and 
network technology in recent years, under the gradual 
improvement of network bandwidth and quality, the 
real-time transmission of high-quality video and audio 
becomes possible. Therefore, the transmission of 
multimedia and relative network application 
technologies have gradually been developed and 
become popular, such as the technology of Distance 
Education, Video Conference and Video on Demand, 
etc.
Distance Education is a very effective method of 
learning. The advantage of Distance Education is that it 
can overcome the obstacle of geographical location; 
making students on remote sides feel that they are at 
the incidence like being in the environment of 
attending classes in a classroom. Moreover, it can save 
cost and time of the students for their commutation to 
and fro the classroom.  
Although Distance Education has many advantages, 
the biggest obstacle is the investment on equipment. 
For instance, teaching mode that intends to achieve 
real-time two-way video/audio teaching effect needs to 
be established with costly Video Conference system. 
This type of system usually demands exclusive 
equipment and very high bandwidth. To enterprises or 
schools with insufficient budget, it is almost impossible 
for them to establish the system.

In order to enable more enterprises and schools to 
apply Distance Education, this research has combined  
two kinds of Grid Computing technologies such as 
Access Grid and Data Grid for building one set of 
teaching system that consists of expandability and 
resources sharing capability. 
2. E-learning and Distance Education  
The development of current Distance Education 
System for E-learning can roughly be classified into 3 
types as follows [1]: 
2.1. Multicast Teaching System: 
This type of system is that the teacher and the 
students can be located in different places. By using 
network technology, the video/audio of the 
classroom teaching and multimedia teaching 
materials can be transmitted real-time to the remote 
side classrooms. Furthermore, it allows the two-way 
real-time communication between the teacher and 
the students in remote side classrooms. 
2.2. Virtual Classroom Teaching System: 
This type of system adopts one set of teaching 
management system to simulate the scenario of 
attending class in a classroom (such as teacher’s 
lecture, holding examination, specified assignment 
or questions answering, student proposed question 
or participating examination, etc). Teacher and 
students can link to the teaching management 
system at any time through the Internet in front of 
computer for teaching or learning. 
2.3. Video on Demand Teaching System: 
This type of system adopts the technology of 
VOD (Video on Demand). Students can obtain the 
learning teaching materials through the Internet 
by using the computer or TV furnished with Set- 
Top Box and to process distance learning in 
accordance with personal learning speed by 
controlling the broadcasting process. 
The teaching mode of this research combines 
Multicast and VOD teaching modes. Real-time video 
teaching is performed at fixed time but the rest of time 
is only web teaching. For instance, after the class, the 
video teaching course is produced as video stream file 
for broadcasting online for the convenience of learners 
who can not watch the real-time video teaching course. 
3. Access Grid and Grid Computing 
Access Grid is the technology developed by U.S. 
Argonne National Laboratory. It enables many people 
to process interactions and opinion exchanges through 
video and audio. At present, it has been used in many 
sites that need video such as training, teaching, 
conference and seminar, etc. The application software 
of Access Grid is called Access Grid Toolkit. This is a 
freeware that anybody can freely download from the 
Access Grid web site. On the web site, it also provides 
complete technical archives for giving necessary 
assistance to its users. Up to September 2003, the latest 
version of Access Grid Toolkit is Version 2.1 [2]. 
Before Access Grid Toolkit Version 2.0, Access 
Grid is only a kind of video conference system. After 
Version 2.0, Access Grid has already tightly combined 
with Grid technology, therefore the Grid Middleware 
Globus Toolkit needs to be installed before the 
installation of Access Grid Toolkit 2.0.  
The middleware Globus will check thoroughly all the 
available resources in the Grid when making a 
computing task, such as which hosts are available, how 
much processing capability is left, what the available 
data is in the database. Then, the tasks required by the 
users will allocate its resources and control its action 
by the system [3].  
As AG (Access Grid) 2.0 has already tightly 
combined with Grid so that all the functions of Grid 
technology such as authentication, resource allocation, 
and remote data access and fault detection are the 
standard function of Access Grid; at the same time, 
XML Web service is also the data transmitting method 
of Access Grid. 
In Globus Toolkit 3.0, Web Service is already the 
standard architecture named OGSA (Open Grid 
Services Architecture). The Web Service based on 
OGSA is also named Grid Service [4]. 
4. The Access Grid Architecture 
The system established in this research will use the 
following architecture as Implementation. 
4.1. The front end 
The experiment location of this research is in Li Zen 
High School in Taichung, Taiwan. By using Access 
Grid technologies, the school can integrate their 
training courses and materials into Grid environment 
which provides more flexible teaching mode. 
It is necessary to set up a Portal Web Site in the 
Access Grid system first, which not only provides 
services to the members of the Grid, but also acts as a 
teaching platform for the other academies through the 
Internet [5]. Figure 1 is the architecture of Access Grid.

Figure 1. Architecture of Access Grid 
Behind the Portal Web Site, We will set up a Video 
Conference Platform via Access Grid Toolkit. This 
Platform requires the following hard wares: 
(1) 4 sets of PC – one for Display, one for Video 
Capture, one for Audio capture, and the other 
one for management. 
(2) 4 sets of Video Camera. 
(3) Several Microphones, based on how many 
people in the conference room. 
(4) 3 sets of projector 
In AG 2.0, Virtual Venue is the most important part 
that provides the following functions [6]: 
 Entry/Exit Authorization Information 
 Connections to other Venues 
 Coherence among Users 
 Client Capabilities Negotiation 
 Applications 
Virtual Venue is divided into three major parts, 
which are Venue server, Venue client and Venue Server 
Management Client. Their major function is to provide 
one collaborate place to all users [7].  
The advantage of Virtual Venue is unlimited 
expansion; that is, if a new organization is to join the 
e-learning parade of Access Grid only if this new 
organization establishes its own Virtual Venue and 
establishes the inter-authentication relationship with 
other existing Virtual Venue, it can join the Access Grid 
and become one of the members.  
4.2. Access Grid and Data Grid 
   Virtual Venue is a place where users collaborate so 
that we can establish one Data Grid Node in one 
Virtual Venue as the place for storing teaching 
resources. For the students who could not participate in 
the real-time courses, they can also watch them after 
the classes. Nevertheless, the files that record the video 
of the classes are usually so huge that they require high 
capacity of storage device such as Disk Array, NAS or 
SAN, Therefore, we can use Data Grid technology to 
substitute the above storage device [8]. 
Establishment of Data Grid only uses the internal 
idle teaching or administration computer resources 
within the school. In this way, it is possible that the 
storage space obtained will not be less than that of an 
expensive storage device. Figure 2 is the architecture 
figure of the combination of Access Grid and Data 
Grid.  
Figure 2. Data Grid Architecture 
Data Grid environment consists of two important 
elements: GRIS (Grid Resource information Services) 
and MDS (Metacomputing Directory Services). GRIS 
provides an infrastructure for storing and managing the

status and components around the Whole Grid. MDS is 
based on LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access 
Protocol), which is used for storing and looking up data 
related to information on the Grid [9]. 
The Data Grid Architecture we adopt is separated 
into two parts. For the part inside the school we call it 
Local Grid, which is formed by two Nodes. Each Node 
is comprised of a PC Cluster formed by 4 PCs. For the 
above PC, its configuration is Pentium III 600 MHz 
CPU, 128 MB RAM, 20 MB HDD, 10/100 Fast 
Ethernet and its operation system is Red Hat Linux 9.0. 
4.3. The Back End 
The system set up by this research can not only be 
applied to the teaching on campus, but also provide 
other academies through the Internet to share its 
teaching material. Herein we bring up an Internet 
virtual organization concept of “Partner Academy”, 
which can be regarded as a ”Resources Receivers” who 
can not only share the present sources on the Internet, 
but also act as a “Resources Providers” who provides 
resources. Each partner academy can provide different 
resources according to its specialty.  
Based on the architecture of Data Grid, information 
placed in each Local Grid should have its uniqueness 
and will not be repeated.  For example, what is placed 
in school A will be mathematics and what is placed in 
school B will be teaching content of literature. In so 
doing, it will not result in waste of teaching resource 
investment. Figure 3 shows the framework of partner 
academy.

5. Conclusions 
This research hopes to integrate those idle computer 
facilities in academies by Grid Computing and the 
techniques of Access Grid and Data Grid so as to save 
cost and make best use of resources. For those 
academies that have insufficient budges, they can then 
obtain better services and enormous teaching resources 
through the techniques of Access Grid. With the 
continual participation of partner academies, the 
expected accomplishments and experiences of this 
research can be provided as reference to those 
academies which hope to develop e-learning so as to 
save their cost and time to develop the similar system.
