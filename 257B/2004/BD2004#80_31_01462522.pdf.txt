actinides, we construct a 4-π Ge-spectrometer utilizing  multiple 
gamma-ray detection method. This spectrometer consists of 30 Ge 
crystals and BGO anti-Compton shields. Generally, a data 
acquisition system for such a big Ge spectrometer consists of 
many NIM modules; it requires large space and huge cost. To 
overcome these problems, we developed a new data acquisition 
system with digital signal processing techniques. This system is 
mounted in a 19 inches VME sub-rack, and the cost of this system 
is greatly reduced. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
HE aim of our study is the acquisition of neutron cross-
section data for the minor actinides (such as 237Np, 
241Am and 243Am) that are important for the development of 
innovative nuclear reactor technology. We developed a new 
advanced measurement technology for the acquirement of 
neutron cross-section data of the minor actinides [1]. In this 
technique, we construct a 4-π Ge-spectrometer utilizing 
multiple gamma-ray detection (gamma-gamma or higher-fold 
coincidence) method. Fig. 1 shows the conceptual design of 
the 4-π Ge-spectrometer. The present 4-π Ge-spectrometer will 
be for the Time Of Flight (TOF) with pulsed neutron. This 
spectrometer consists of 30 Ge crystals and BGO anti-
Compton shields. Two of these 30 crystals are segmented into 
6 channels, thus, this spectrometer has 40 Ge outputs and 128 
BGO outputs.

In multiple gamma-ray detection method, we deal multiply 
coincident signals from an array of Ge and BGO detectors. To 
make a trigger signal, we check the anti-coincidence of the 
output signals from Ge detectors and BGO detectors first, and 
we detect a coincidence pattern of the signals from the Ge 
detectors after that. Generally, a data acquisition system for 
such a Ge-spectrometer consists of NIM modules. However, 
because the coincidence pattern is very complicated and 
changed by the kinds of the experiments, many NIM modules, 
large space, and costs, which require more than US 20,000 
dollars per one Ge detector channel, are required [2].  
Recently, digital signal processing techniques and digital-
analog conversion technology improves rapidly, and a high 
density and high cost performance data acquisition system 
became possible. Because of that, the digitization of the data 
acquisition system develops rapidly in many fields such as 
physics experiments and space development [3]-[5]. 
From these backgrounds, we developed a new data 
acquisition system for the 4-π Ge-spectrometer with digital 
signal processing techniques. 
 
II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
A. Conceptual Design 
Fig. 2 shows a conceptual design of our data acquisition 
system. The system consists of three Main ADC modules, five 
Fast Timing modules and a Coincidence module. A photo of 
the Main ADC module, the Fast Timing module and the 
Coincidence module are shown in Fig. 3. The preamplifier

 outputs of the Ge detectors are directly put into the Main ADC 
modules and the Fast Timing Modules. The outputs of BGO 
anti-Compton detectors are only put into the Fast Timing 
Modules. The Fast Timing Module discriminates detector 
signals and send them to the Coincidence module. The 
Coincidence Module checks (anti-)coincidence of these signals 
and generates a trriger signal to the Main ADC Modules. On 
the Main ADC modules, when a trigger signal comes, the 
pulse height is analyzed by fitting or filtering digitized data. 
All modules are 9U VME boards and can be mounted in a 19 
inches VME sub-rack. The cost of this system is reduced one 
order of magnitude. 
B. Triggering  
The Fast Timing module consists of a big removable analog 
daughter board and a 9U digital board. On this analog daughter 
board, there are 32 input channels from the preamplifier 
outputs of the Ge detectors and the PMT outputs from BGO 
anti-Compton detectors. On the analog daughter board, input 
signals are shaped with a differentiation circuit, a pole-zero 
cancellation circuit, and amplification circuits. The shaped 
input signals become LVDS output signals with a Constant-
Fraction Discriminator (CFD) for judging the existence of the 
signals by the gamma rays. The 32 output signals of CFDs are 
input to the Coincidence Module. The constant of the wave 
shaping (the time constant of the differentiation circuit and the 
pole-zero cancellation circuit, and the gain of the amplification 
circuits) and the threshold values of the CFDs can be changed 
via a VME-bus or Front Panel switches. 
For the Coincidence Module, we choose a Field 
Programmable Gate Array (FPGA: XC2V2000-6FG676C, 
2M-gates 200MHz) because the coincidence condition varied 
in the experiments and we deal the input logic signals from the 
Fast Timing. The Coincidence module has the 256 LVDS 
input channels. It detects a coincidence condition with FPGA 
and makes and sends a trigger signal to the Main ADC 
modules.

0-7803-8700-7/04/$20.00 (C) 2004 IEEE 1490
  
Because the program of the FPGA can be uploaded via 
VME-bus, the coincidence condition can be freely changed by 
the kind of the experiments.  
In some of the experiments, we need to measure the time of 
the signal interval. That time interval is very wide from several 
ns for judging the coincidence condition to several ms for TOF 
experiments. Because of that, by using the FPGA, we can 
measure the time interval of the signals with time resolution of 
5ns and maximum range of 84 ms. 
On the Coincidence Module and Main ADC Modules, there 
are connectors for Multichannel Buffered Serial Port (McBSP). 
McBSP is a TI’s proprietary serial line implemented in DSPs 
and has a speed of 50Mbps. By using McBSP for the 
communication between the Coincidence Module and Main 
DSP Modules, it can do a more intelligence triggering, such as 
to transmit the trigger information to the DSPs on Main ADC 
modules. 
C. Energy Measurement 
Photograph of the Main ADC Module is shown in Fig. 4. 
In the Main ADC Modules, we implement Digital Signal 
Processor (DSP: TMX320VC5502APGE-300, 16bit 300MHz 
600MIPS) for each channel because we want to change a 
digital filter freely and the cost of the chip is low.  
Since detector signal is digitized in a high-speed ADC, it 
seems possible to do all analog processing such as 
differentiation and integration or filtering within the DSPs [6, 
7]. However, this necessitates longer data size for fitting and 
consumes data processing power. In addition, because our 4-π 
spectrometer will be for TOF experiments with pulsed neutron, 
event rate can be very high and there will be large pile-up. To 
prepare such large pile-up signal, without pulse shaping, we 
must reduce amplifier gain and it degrades signal-to-noise ratio. 
To prepare the pile-up without degrading the signal-to-noise 
ratio, we implement analog pulse shaping circuits on the Main 
ADC Modules.  
The Main ADC Module consists of 4 removable analog 
daughter boards and a 9U digital board. Each analog daughter 
boards has 4 input channels and each channel has analog 
circuits for differentiation, pole-zero cancellation, integrating, 
amplification and offset adjustment.  All constants of the wave 
shaping (the differential time, the integral time, the pole-zero 
cancellation, the voltage gain, and the offset adjustment) also 
can be changed using a VME-bus or Front Panel switches. The 
shaped output signals of the analog daughter boards are 
digitized with 16 ADCs (12bit 40MHz), and the digitized data 
is stored in FIFO which is implemented in an FPGA. When a 
trigger signal from the Coincidence Module is comes, the 
FIFO FPGA sends the digitized data to a DSP with a Trigger 
ID number. The pulse height is calculated by using the DSP 
and is sent to another DSP for control via McBSP lines 
connected through a CPLD. The control DSP bundled 100 sets 
of the data from the 16 channels, and put into a Dual Port 
Memory. The bundled data is read out from the Dual Port 
Memory with a PC.

 D. Technical Summary  
The following data, shown in Table 1 summarize 
specifications of our new data acquisition system. 
 
III. PERFORMANCE OF THE MAIN ADC MODULES 
A complete performance evaluation has not yet been made, 
because the 4- π Ge-spectrometer hasn't been completed yet. 
The performance of the Main ADC module has been tested 
with a pulse generator (ORTEC 419) and Eurisys clover 
detector, which is one component of the 4- π Ge-spectrometer. 
A. Noise And Cross Talk 
Fig. 5 shows output signals of ADC #1~4 when test pulse 
from a pulse generator is injected on input #1. Though periodic 
noise originated from the VME clock frequency (8MHz) was 
seen, there is no detectable cross talk and the noise is below 
acceptable level (1.5~3.3 of least significant bit: LSB). 
Fig. 6. shows a time dependency of the peak height on ch1 
and 2. Test pulses are generated with a pulse generator, and it 
was the temperature change of 10K in this measurement. 
Temperature dependency of the peak height is substantially 
small, when the peak height is about 1200 LSB, the 
temperature dependence is less than 0.15 LSB/K at room 
temperature. 
B. Test With a Clover Detector 
To test the performance of the Main ADC module, the 
energy resolution was measured with the clover detector.  
Fig. 7. shows acquired traces for fully absorbed 1.33MeV 
gamma-rays (60Co). The trace shaped with analog circuits 
(Differential time: 500ns Integral time: 120ns) is shown in 
trace (a), and the trace with largest differential time (33us) and 
smallest integral time (120ns), which is almost the same as 
preamplifier output, is shown in trace (b). To compare these

 traces, the trace shaped with Moving Window Deconvolution 
(MWD) filtering[8] (filter length: 2us), which is widely used in 
digital signal processing, is also shown in trace (c). 
In Table 2, the FWHM of the full energy peak at 1.33MeV 
is shown. To evaluate FWHM of this system, we measured the 
gamma-ray spectrum with Labo: 2100C MCA and main 
ORTEC: 572A amplifier (shaping time 2us). The FWHMs 
show almost the same value for MCA and the new system, and 
good energy resolution could be achieved with short shaping 
time. 
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
We have described the design and the performance of a new 
data acquisition system for the 4-π Ge-spectrometer with 
digital signal processing techniques. In the tests with the clover 
detectors, good energy resolution can be achieved with short 
shaping time. This system can be mounted in a 19 inches VME 
sub-sub-rack, we can reduce the cost of the readout system by 
one order of magnitude.
