Abstract: Within North China there is a special rim zone 
characterized with a mixture of crop farming and herd grazing. Due 
to intensive land use for cropping and grazing, natural ecosystems in 
this semi-arid zone have been seriously destroyed in the past decades. 
Several strong sandstorms in recent years swept through the zone to 
invade into Beijing the capital of China and other big cities in North 
China. It has been commonly agreed that the sandstorms are the 
direct results of landscape ecological destroy in Northwest China, 
Inner Mongolia and Mongolia Plateau. The ecological degradation 
and desertification are the core issues concerned from both inside and 
outside China especially Japan and Korea. In order to monitor the 
ecosystem development and its dynamics in the zone and in the 
Northwest China Plateau for possible programs of environmental 
improvement, many academic efforts have been on the way toward 
the zone. The current study at our lab is part of the efforts in China. 
The objective of the study is to monitor the land use changes in last 
twenty years in the rim zone. ArcInfo GIS has been used as tool to 
establish a spatial database for the social-economic and natural 
conditions of the zone. Remote sensing (RS) data especially MODIS 
and Land TM images have been used for land use mapping. 
Integrating GIS with RS techniques, we analyze the land use 
dynamics of the zone, which has above 200 counties spreading in 
Qinghai, Gansu, Shaanxi. Shanxi, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, 
Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces. The zone can be divided into three 
sub-regions for detailed examination: the east, the middle and the 
west. The result indicates that farmland in the zone expands 3.12% 
from1985 to 2000, while rangeland as a contrast reduces 3.44% 
during the period. On the other hand, the occupied area of settlements 
(villages and towns) increases up to 11.61%. All these imply that 
intensive anthropogenic activities have been the forces driving the 
landscape ecosystem in the zone to change dramatically in the recent 
decades. It is very urgent to administrate crop farming and herd 
grazing for a sustainable development in the zone where ecosystem 
has been very fragile.

Ⅰ. INTRODUCTION 
Environmentally and climatologically, the Earth is a system. 
Changes of environments and landscapes in one part of the 
Earth will have some effects on the others. To understand the 
changes of the giant system in the last decades and their 
potential impacts on mankind in the next future, many efforts 
have been devoted to study the environment and terrestrial 
ecosystem of the Earth system [1]. Geographically North 
China is very important in governing the global system and its 
dynamics. The rim zone within North China is agriculturally 
characterized with a mixture of crop farming and herd grazing. 
In the south of the rim zone is so-called agricultural region of 
China, feeding the Chinese and breeding the Chinese culture. 
Outside the rim zone is so-called grassland pasture region with 
nomads in the past, who have been settled down in recent 
decades. Due to intensive land use for cropping and grazing, 
natural ecosystems in this semi-arid zone have been seriously 
destroyed in the past decades. Several strong sandstorms in 
recent years swept through the zone to invade into Beijing the 
capital of China and other big cities in North China [2][3]. The 
impacts of the sandstorms were not only limited within China 
but also extended into the northeast Asia. It has been 
commonly agreed that the sandstorms are the direct results of 
landscape ecological destroy in Northwest China, Inner 
Mongolia and Mongolia Plateau [2]. Due to its importance of 
geographical location as the juncture between North China and 
the Northwest China Plateau, the rim zone has attracted many 
concerns from scientific, political and public circles. The 
ecological degradation and desertification are the core issues 
in these concerns from both inside and outside China 
especially Japan and Korea.  
In order to monitor the ecosystem development and its 
dynamics in the zone for possible programs of environmental 
improvement, many academic efforts have been on the way 
toward the zone. The current study at our lab is part of the 
efforts in China. The objective of the study is to monitor the 
changes of land use and land cover in last twenty years in the 
rim zone. Emphases are given to the changes of farmland for 
cropping and grassland pasture for cattle grazing.  
Ⅱ. METHODOLOGY 
A. The rim zone and its situation 
The rim zone is a transaction region in North China. The 
feature of agriculturally transforming from cropping into 
pasture grazing makes the zone very unique not only in China 
but also throughout the world. Annual precipitation of the 
zone is usually around 200mm. There are total 200 counties 
and banners (local administrative unit of China) in the zone, 
0-7803-8742-2/04/$20.00 (c) 2004 IEEE 4021
 with a territory of 707000 km2. Geographically the rim zone 
can be divided into three sub-zones: the east, the middle and 
the west. The east sub-zone is consisted of 47 counties and 
banners, mainly locating in west Liaoning, north Hebei, west 
Jilin, west Heilongjiang and east Inner Mongolia. The middle 
sub-zone has 96 counties and banners, spatially distributing in 
south Inner Mongolia, north Hebei, north Shanxi, north 
Shaanxi and east Gansu. The west sub-zone has 57 counties 
and banners, mainly in west Shaanxi, south Gansu, east 
Qinghai and south Ningxia. 
Population of the rim zone is totally about 60 million, with a 
density of 85 person/km2. Among the population, above ¾ (46 
million) reside in rural villages as farmers or herders. Total 
output of rural economy was RMB¥194.6 (US$23.7) billion in 
1995 and RMB¥214.3 billion in 2000, with an annual growth 
of 1.67%, which is much lower than the annual growth of 
entire China (7%). Annual net income of rural resident in the 
zone is very low: only RMB¥408 (US$51) per capita in 1995 
and RMB¥1141 per capita in 2000. The net income level is 
only about haft of entire China average. Rural poverty of the 
rim zone has long been well known in China. Poor living 
conditions and few ways for better life make rural farmers in 
the rim zone to focus their attention on the land. Consequently 
the increase of land use intensity in the zone has aggravated 
the serious environmental and ecosystem degradation. 
B. Remote sensing data and image processing 
In the study, we mainly use Landsat TM images together 
with MODIS data as the data sources for identification of each 
type of land use and land cover in the rim zone. About 50 TM 
images are used, acquired in two years: 1985 and 1999. Since 
land cover change is defined as the change of specific type of 
land cover in a time period, the detection of such change 
through interpretation of remote sensing images is simply to 
identify the type of land cover in the two years for comparison 
of its change in area and quality. To match the geographical 
location of the images into a specific coordinate system, we 
select Albert conic projection for geometric correction, which 
can be done through georeferencing with a number of control 
points. In each image we obtain 20-40 control points for 
geometric correction. Polynomial model with order of 2 is 
selected as geometric correction model. Nearest neighboring 
method is used to resample the pixel values for the output file. 
C. Types of land use/covers for image interpretation 
The system developed by Liu [4] is used in the study as the 
types of land use and land cover. The system is consisted of 6 
types: farmland, forestland, grassland, water body, urban and 
roads, and others. Farmland is defined as the cropping land for 
such field crops as rice, wheat, maize, sorghum, potatoes and 
so on. Farmland in China is generally consisted of two sub-
types: water farmland mainly for paddy rice and dry farmland 
for wheat, corn, etc. Forestland is the land with arboreal trees 
and woodland is the land with shrubs and low trees. Grassland 
is mainly covered with various grasses. In our study, we 
further divided grassland into three sub-types: sparse grassland 
with low grass cover rate, moderate grassland with moderate 
grass cover rate and dense grassland with high grass cover rate. 
The type of urban and roads is mainly composed of three sub-
types in our region: towns, villages and roads. Though Liu [4] 
divided water body into several sub-types such as channels, 
lakes, ponds, and so on, we only use them as one type in the 
study because our region is a semi-arid region with very few 
water body areas. Among the type of others, we identify 
several sub-types according to the special features of land 
cover in the rim zone: gobi, sandy land, salty land, wetland, 
bare soil and bare rock. Gobi is an important landscape in west 
China, defined as the land covered dominantly with small 
stones or rock particles with diameter of 2-10cm. Except 
wetland, these sub-types of other land covers represent a 
negative direction of landscape ecosystem development. 
Ⅲ. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
A. Changes of land uses in the rim zone 
Our monitoring results (table 1) indicate that land uses in 
the rim zone had experienced dramatic changes in last two 
decades. One obvious feature is the expansion of farmland. 
The cultivated land area increases 6682 km2 between 1985 and 
1999, accounting for 3.12% cultivated land area in mid-1980s. 
Expansion of cultivated land is actually in cost of grassland, 
which has shown a similar percentage of decrease during the 
period. In 1985 the zone had about 31525.28 km2 of grassland 
but the type of land use dropped to 301152.1km2 in 1999, with 
a decrease rate of 3.44% (table 1). Another feature revealed in 
table 1 is the rapid expansion of towns and villages. This 
implies that pressure of population has made the occupation of 
man-made settlement steadily expanding to meet the essential 
living demands of local people. As a cost, the area of wetland 
and water bodies is in disappearing. The increase of forestland 
is the only one encouraging feature favorable to ecosystem 
sustainability in the rim zone. This increase in forestland is 
probably due to the campaigns of re-foresting the landscape in 
the region to harness the desertification and environmental 
degradation.

Tables 2 and 3 shows land use changes in two typical 
administrative units of the zone: table 2 for Tolon County and 
table 3 for the Left Kolchin Rear Banner. More detailed 
classification of land uses have been employed for the 
monitoring in the two units. In Tolon County, the most 
obvious change is the bare soil. This type of land cover was 
only 5.3km2 in 1985, while it expanded into 20.3km2 in 1999, 
with an increase of 2.8 times. Sharp changes can also be seen 
in woodland, sandy land and wetland. The increase of 
woodland in this county is 1.4 times between 1985 and 1999. 
This increase is probably attributed to degradation of 
0-7803-8742-2/04/$20.00 (c) 2004 IEEE 4022
 forestland into woodland in the evolution of local ecosystem. 
As shown in table 2, forestland decreases from 312.2km2 in 
1985 to 218.1km2 in 1999, with a reduction of 94km2, which is 
larger than the increase of woodland area (72km2) during the 
period. Of course, the efforts to forest the landscape may also 
have some positive contributions to the increase of woodland. 
With regarding to ecosystem degradation, the expansion of 
sparse grassland is exactly attributed to the reduction of 
moderate grassland. During this period, sparse grassland 
increased about 30km2, while moderate grassland decreases 
339 km2. Since the increase of sparse grassland is much 
smaller than the decrease of moderate grassland. The 
degradation of grassland ecosystem is even more severe. This 
implies that only small part of the moderate grassland 
degrades into sparse grassland. Most degrade into sandy land 
or bare soil. Quality of the landscape is also not optimistic in 
the county. The salty land expanded above 10 times during the 
period. In 1985 the county only had about 25km2 of salty land. 
However, this type of land cover has expanded to 287km2, 
with an increase of 10.67 times. The disappearance of many 
wetland areas also confirms the severe degradation of 
landscape environment and ecosystem in the county. The 
sharp changes in main types of land cover in the county have 
reached the level of threatening the sustainability of landscape 
environment ecosystem.

As a contrast to the severe degradation, the change of land 
use and land cover in Left Kolchin Rear Banner since mid-
1980s is much better in terms of environmental development 
and ecosystem evolution (table 3) though some similar 
degradations can also been seen in the Banner. The land 
use/cover change limits to below 50% in all types between 
1985 and 1999, while the change in Tolon reaches to above 10 
times for salty land and 2.8 times for bare soil. According to 
our monitoring results, the Banner has quite stable bare soil 
area during the period. Only 0.5km2 of bare soil can be 
identified on the images of the Banner in 1985 and this area 
keeps unchanged in 1999. One interesting feature in land 
use/cover change in the Banner is probably the expansion of 
dry farmland. In 1985 this type of land cover was 1415km2. It 
increases to 1619km2 in 1999, with an increase of 203km2. 
This increase may be contributed by the reduction of sparse 
grassland and moderate grassland. The two types of grassland 
reduces 105km2 and 368km2 respectively during the period. 
This means that the pressure of population in the Banner has 
forced many grasslands be reclaimed into cropping land. The 
expansion of farmland is accompanied with increase of rural 
village areas. During the period, area of rural villages 
increases 48km2, with a rate of 27.65%. Such expansion of 
cultivated land may not be an encouraging direction of 
environmental development and ecosystem evolution in the 
Banner where rainfall is only about 200mm and the landscape 
is a typical semi-arid region. 
B. Land use change in the three sub-zones  
Table 4 compares the land use change of the three sub-
zones since mid-1980s. Farmland in China includes two types: 
water farmland and dry farmland. During the period, water 
farmland in the rim zone experienced a reduction of area. 
Totally the area reduced 131km2, with a rate of 4.52%. This is 
mainly contributed by the sharp reduction in the middle sub-
zone, which has a reduction of 322km2 during the period. The 
reduction in the west sub-zone is only 5.5km2, with a rate of 
2.23% (table 4). Spatial distribution of water farmland in the 
middle sub-zone is mainly along the Yellow River valley. The 
sharp reduction of water farmland during the period may be 
the direct results of water shortage in the region. Yellow River 
is the second important river in China. However, in recent two 
decades the river has been facing severe problem of over use 
of its limited water resources, which has made the river to 
break its flow in lower reaches to the sea by several times. The 
farmland for paddy rice is one of the reasons leading to over 
use of the river’s limited water resources. Facing the shortage 
of water supply, many farmlands for paddy rice in the rime 
zone, where the environment is not suitable for paddy rice 
planting, have been changed into dry farmland for such crops 
as wheat, sunflower and sugar beet. However, the east sub-
zone still has an increase of water farmland area during the 
period. This probably is due to the relatively sufficient water 
resources in the sub-zone along the Daqinganling Mountains. 
Another factor that may be important in shaping the 
direction of ecosystem evolution is reclamation of grassland 
and forestland/woodland into farmland. During the period 
between 1985 and 1999 the area of dry farmland in the rim 
zone increases 6813km2, with an increase rate of 3.24%. Dry 
farmland expands more in the east sub-zone than in the middle 
0-7803-8742-2/04/$20.00 (c) 2004 IEEE 4023
 sub-zone or the west sub-zone. The east sub-zone has an 
increase of about 6% during the period and it is below 2% in 
both middle and west sub-zones. Together with water 
farmland, we can conclude that reclamation in the east sub-
zone is much more severe than that in the middle and the west 
sub-zones. Examination of grassland area changes in the three 
sub-zones enables us to touch the scenario of intensive 
reclamation in the rim zone and makes us to concern the 
sustainable development of grassland ecosystem in the zone. 
Table 4. Land use change rate in the three sub-zones 
Land use type East (%) Middle (%) West (%) 
Water farmland 10.16 -43.64 -2.23 
Dry farmland 5.96 1.63 1.70 
Forestland 99.70 251.30 102.31 
Woodland 5.31 -5.84 0.32 
Sparse grassland -19.76 6.96 0.47 
Moderate grassland -8.07 -2.98 -3.57 
Dense grassland 0.97 -17.38 1.64 
Water bodies -16.20 19.68 8.79 
Wetland -1.87 -4.78 -0.67 
Towns  12.22 23.79 14.43 
Villages 9.94 15.67 8.17 
Roads 48.04 46.41 12.26 
Sandy land 1.79 6.18 -7.94 
Gobi 36.54 0 23.43 
Bare soil 50.32 -36.32 1.29 
Bare rock -8.9 23.58 -2.93 
Salty land -1.5 2.15 -2.75 
Others -17.72 0 -8.08 
All three types of grassland have experienced a decrease in 
area during the period between 1985 and 1999 (table 4). The 
reduction rate of both moderate and high cover rate grasslands 
is high up to 4-5%, which is higher than the increase rate of 
dry farmland. Total decrease of grassland in the rim zone 
reaches the magnitude of 10372km2. Analyzing the table 4, we 
find that the decrease of grassland can be associated with the 
expansion of such types of land use/cover as dry farmland, 
village, sandy land, and bare surfaces. Since grassland 
represents the dominant natural ecosystem in the rim zone, the 
reduction of its areas reflects the severe status of current 
ecological conditions for sustainable development of the 
fragile economic system. Therefore, ideology of sustainable 
development and ecosystem conservation must be emphasized 
in planning local economic development. 
In the east zone, both sparse and moderate grasslands have 
shown a dramatic drop of areas. Only dense grassland shows 
slight increase. However, the increase is much smaller than the 
decrease. As indicated in table 4, the areas of sparse and 
moderate grasslands have a decrease of 6395km2, with a rate 
of 11.05% (the decrease rate for sparse grassland is 19.76%).  
Another scenario of grassland degradation can be observed 
in the middle and the west sub-zones. Remarkable deduction 
of grassland area can be seen in the types of dense and 
moderate grasslands, while the area of sparse grassland has a 
change of increase during the period. In 1985 the middle sub-
zone had areas of 24945km2 and 49611km2 respectively that 
can be classified as dense and moderate grassland. The areas 
dropped toward 20612km2 and 48133km2 respectively in 1999. 
Thus the area decrease is 1478km2 and 4336km2 respectively 
for the two types of grassland, with a rate of 3% and 17%. The 
sharp decrease of dense grassland in the middle sub-zone 
confirms the argument of severe ecological degradation 
currently existing in the grassland landscape of the zone. 
Similar environmental degradation can also be seen in the 
west sub-zone, as shown in table 4, though the severity is not 
as big as that in the middle sub-zone.  
Ⅳ. CONCLUSION 
Integration of remote sensing with GIS techniques is 
employed in the study to detect the changes of land use/cover 
in the rim zone within North China in recent two decades. One 
obvious feature is that farmland increases steadily while the 
grassland decreases accordingly. This is due to the reclamation 
of grassland for cropping. During 1985-1999, farmland in the 
rim zone increased 6682 km2, with an increase rate of 3.12%. 
As a contrast, grassland decreased 10373 km2 during the 
period, with a rate of 3.44%. Therefore, it can be concluded 
that the expansion of cropping in the zone is in cost of 
grassland shrinking. Climatologically the zone is a semi-arid 
environment, hence unfavorable for extensive cropping 
especially paddy rice planting. However, the east part of the 
zone has an increase of water farmland by up to 10%. 
Grassland ecosystem and semi-arid environment has been 
remarkably destroyed under the intensive and unreasonable 
use of the limited natural endeavors in the rim zone. 
Fortunately the environmental degradation in the zone has 
been highly concerned in China. Some actions such as 
returning farmland into its original grassland and forestland 
have been on the way to release the degradation in the zone.
