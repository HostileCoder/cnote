SUMMARY & CONCLUSIONS 
 
This paper presents a possibility with which the reliability 
knowledge of maintenance employees can be used in order to 
receive reliability data that can be used to do simulations or 
further calculations. Using the presented methodology opens 
up a big source of information. The use of employee 
knowledge entails the processing of imprecise data, as the 
knowledge is not given in the form of a failure time plot, but 
in the form of verbal expressions and specific information. 
The paper deals with the data format and precision of expert-
based information. 
A methodology is presented which enables the 
transformation of certain employee (further called experts) 
information into reliability data. Apart from that the paper also 
shows the influence of imprecision of expert information and 
how to handle this imprecision in order to get applicable 
results. As a finishing subject the paper also provides a 
possibility with which the deviations of expert information 
from reality can be estimated dependent on the expert 
statement itself. With that approach one can tax the trustability 
of expert information. 
 
1. INTRODUCTION 
 
An essential precondition for the use of simulations 
(availability of production lines or determination of 
maintenance costs) is the existence of data. The reliability 
information of the components that shall be considered in the 
modeling and simulation must be available. Although small or 
middle-class enterprises cannot provide a machine- or facility 
focused data-collection very often, it would be useful for them 
to use simulation results anyhow. The key for solving that 
kind of problems lies represented by the employees in the 
enterprises themselves. The experience and knowledge of the 
employees comprises information about many years. The use 
of expert knowledge implies the processability of data 
revealed by experts. That means that the kind of expert data is 
transformable into reliability parameters. Therefore, it would 
be the most convenient way to gather experts’ knowledge 
directly in the form of parameters (Ref. 1) that build up a 
failure behavior representing failure distribution, as for 
example a Weibull distribution. For many components 
(especially electronic ones) one can also use data out of 
catalogues, for example out of the Military Handbook (Ref. 2) 
and data banks. This described most convenient proceeding is 
not working in the most cases. Many catalogued values do not 
match the operational profile of the real product or are too 
imprecise and can only be used for a comparison but not for 
the calculation or the simulation of a real product (e.g. a 
production facility). Apart from that, an update has not taken 
place for the Military Handbook during the last decade. This 
decreases the accuracy of such catalogues once more (Ref. 3). 
Where should such information stem from elsewhere? The 
path that is followed in this paper bases on the use of the 
knowledge of employees, that already collected many 
experience with the machines or facilities during their working 
time in an enterprise. The experts have information about the 
failure behavior, but this knowledge is only available in the 
experts’ speech. Using this source of information is many 
times more practical than assuming that an all knowing expert 
reveals machine- and operation dependent data in the form of 
direct distribution parameters. The language of employee 
experts is very practically oriented and is mainly based on 
times of failures or other events. If it is possible to translate 
this speech into reliability parameters and to quantify the risk 
of usage of these data, also small and medium-sized 
enterprises will be able to use simulation technique in order to 
optimize business processes like maintenance and spare-part 
strategy.

2. BASICS & DEFINITIONS 
 
2.1 Reliability 
 
The reliability R(t) of a system (or component) is the 
probability that, when operating under stated environmental 
conditions, the system (or component) will perform its 
intended function adequately for a specified interval of time t 
(Ref.4). The mathematical description is based on the 
probability density function (pdf) f(t), the cumulative 
distribution function (cdf) F(t) with f(t) = dF(t)/dt, the 
reliability R(t) = 1 – F(t) and the failure rate (hazard function) 
λ(t) = f(t)/R(t). 
 
2.2 The Weibull distribution 
 
The usual description of the failure behavior of 
mechanical systems or components is provided by the three-
parameter Weibull distribution (Ref. 1), with the pdf

with shape parameter b, scale parameter T and location 
parameter t0. For t0 = 0 one speaks of a two-parameter Weibull 
distribution. The failure rate λ(t) of a Weibull distribution is a 
function of time, it can depict all three sections of the well-
known bath-tub curve depending only on the shape parameter. 
 
3. KNOWLEDGE OF EMPLOYEE EXPERTS 
 
The project on which this paper bases, has been done in 
cooperation with ZOLLERN ISOPROFIL, a medium-sized 
manufacturer of steel profiles. The enterprise has many 
experienced employees who are responsible for the 
maintenance of the machines. The project has been done in 
cooperation with two employees. Both of them are working 
already more than 13 years in the enterprise. One of the 
experts is responsible for an annealing furnace, the other one 
coordinates the maintenance activities of a sandblast unit. As 
the project was limited by time every expert was questioned 
only about one critical part of his facility, although the experts 
would have been able to reveal more information about other 
critical elements. 
 
3.1 The Psychological Aspect 
 
Gathering data from an expert is not as easy as starting an 
output plot. The challenge is situated in the information 
transfer from one person to another (Ref. 5). The asked person 
has to understand the question the interviewer asks him, he has 
to remind relevant information, he has to do judgments and 
ratings, and finally he has to answer the posed question. These 
four partial aspects must be considered and the interviewer 
must always be aware of them in order to get valid 
information. To do so, especially for the purpose of eliciting 
reliability information, an extensive motivation prolog took 
place, in which the experts have been told of what use their 
knowledge can be. Further it is important, that the interviewer 
prevents an interviewer-bias, i.e. to prevent an interviewer’s 
misunderstanding of expert statements. Apart from that there 
exists the difficulty for the expert to handle the posed 
question. For answering a question it might be possible, that 
the expert has to deal with many information. If the amount of 
information becomes too big the expert’s answer might be 
very imprecise (Ref. 5), because he could use very rough 
assumptions and simplifications to answer a question he is 
actually overburdened with. These and more aspects (Ref. 5) 
have to be taken into account, when an elicitation of expert 
knowledge shall take place. 
 
3.2 What do employee experts know? 
 
One of the most important assumptions that is made for 
the applicability of employees’ knowledge in order to gather 
input data for purposes of simulation is that they can reveal 
useful data. As already mentioned above it is not likely that an 
employee expert can serve with certain distribution 
parameters. This assumption can be made (Ref. 1) but only in 
scarce cases. The kind of posed questions can be sorted into 
classes of difficulty (Table 1.). 
 
Table 1: Difficulty classes for employee experts 
Objective of a Question Class of Difficulty 
Failure times (first, last) 1 
Modes (when have most of the 
parts failed) and Means 2 
Probabilities 3 
Parameters of Distribution 4 
 
The interviewer started with class No. 1 and proceeded to 
higher difficulties if this was possible, i.e. if the expert could 
handle the posed question. Respective to this, the 
psychological aspect is of most crucial importance, as the 
expert shall not be rushed to give statements to questions he 
does not understand and as a result of that, the interviewer 
obtains wrong and counterproductive data. Expert No.1 chose 
a bearing out of an annealing furnace, as his object of 
consideration. The expert mentioned, that there are six 
identical bearings in the furnace. These six bearings have to 
stand the same stress. As this is given, one can suppose an 
identical failure behavior. During the beginning of the 
elicitation the expert explained that a mainly preventive 
maintenance strategy is applied to the annealing furnace. As a 
result of this almost no bearing fails in the sense of a sudden 
downtime, that makes the whole unit not working. In half year 
intervals the bearings are examined with stethoscopes. If the 
RAMS 2004 - 91 - 0-7803-8215-3/04/$17.00 © 2004 IEEE
 noise of a bearing exceeds a certain (subjective) level it is 
replaced by a new one. According to this statement one might 
think, that it is not possible, to develop a “real” failure 
distribution out of the experts´ knowledge. Two arguments are 
opposing this idea. First, the experts confirmed, that it is most 
probable, that a bearing which is not replaced although the 
noise level would indicate it, fails within the next half year. So 
one would be able to develop a time-shifted failure 
distribution. The second reason is that one has to ask oneself if 
the purpose for which the data is gathered really needs a 
failure-based distribution. An example therefore is the spare 
part strategy, which depends on the need of spare parts and 
thus on the real replacement behavior in the enterprise and not 
on the failure distribution basing on “real” failures. 
In the beginning of the interview expert No.1 was asked 
about the shortest life-time of a bearing that he knows about. 
The answer was 1.75 years. This component really failed and 
caused a massive down-time event. Further the interviewer 
asked for an imprecision-band of this value. Expert No.1 gave 
the statement: “The early failure of this component really 
aggravated me. That is the reason why I know the failure time 
exactly.” This statement of the expert can serve as a prime 
example for the influence of human factors into an expert´s 
knowledge. The expert was also questioned for the longest 
lifetime. This one was 5 years, also without a band. The next 
step of interviewing concerned mode and mean values. As 
shown in table 1 this kind of questions are more difficult to 
answer, as we leave the time-based level and enter 
aggregations of knowledge into values. Expert No.1 
mentioned that most of the parts failed after 3 years (most of 
the parts have been replaced after 3 years). He was also able to 
give a value for the mean failure time which he assigned a 
value of 3.5 to. 
As the correctness of the statement about the most failures 
is very important for the distribution that shall be built up the 
interviewer accomplished an example for the experts after 
they gave an answer to the question. A row of arbitrarily 
chosen failure times was given to the experts and then they 
were asked at what time they think most of the parts have 
failed. 
Expert No.1 had the right understanding respective the 
mode of the failure behavior. So one can expect, that the 
information he gave about the mode of the bearing failure-
behavior is very confidential. 
The next step of difficulty would have been to ask for 
probabilities of failure. But Expert No.1 did not know how to 
deal with the term probability respective to failure-behavior. 
Here we meet the borders of employee expert knowledge. 
 
4. PROCESSING OF GATHERED DATA 
 
The knowledge of the experts must be translated into data 
that is compatible to simulation-tools. Therefore it would be of 
sense to translate these data into failure-distributions. The 
data-analysis bases on the three-parameter Weibull-
distribution, as this one is very appropriate for modeling 
mechanical parts. The use of a three-parameter distribution 
entails the existence of three equations which enable the 
determination of the three parameters. 
 
4.1 Development of the analysis method 
 
The first equation bases on the knowledge about a mode 
(where most parts have failed). Therefore we use the equation 
for the failure-density (Ref.4)

As a result of Eq.(4) one can determine the mode tmod of

can be used. 
Using this equation entails an additional information. As 
already mentioned expert No.1 did not give any information 
about any probabilities of failure. But he was able to give 
another information which can be helpful. The employee 
experts know very often how many parts they already 
replaced. So in a certain way the sample size of a complete 
sample is given. With this information one can determine the 
failure probability according to the longest observed life-time 
by using the equation for the approximation of rank-dependent 
failure-probabilities (Ref.4)

Expert No.1 had information about approximately 36 
parts. According to Eq.(7) this means that a failure probability 
of 98,03 % is assigned to the 36th and last (5 years) failed 
bearing. This information applied to Eq.(6) reveals the second 
necessary correlation.

For the determination of the third necessary correlation 
we do not have a basic definition left; so an assumption must 
be made. The location parameter t0 is the third parameter of 
the Weibull-distribution. If an infinite amount of parts is tested 
RAMS 2004 - 92 - 0-7803-8215-3/04/$17.00 © 2004 IEEE
 the location parameter is the shortest life-time of all parts. In 
the case of expert No.1 36 replacements have been observed. 
According to Eq.(7) the earliest replacement, which took place 
after 1.75 years, is combined with a failure-probability of 
1.907 %. This means, that with a probability of 1.907 % one 
will observe a replacement before 1.75 years. Facing this fact 
it seems assumable that the earliest observed failure yields the 
failure-free time t0 of the Weibull distribution. Using this 
assumption for the case of the bearings would mean that t0 = 
1.75 years. 
Now three equations are available for the determination of 
three distribution-parameters. 
 
4.2 Application of the analysis method 
 
The application of the above developed methodology on 
the bearings of expert No.1 results in a Weibull-distribution 
with the parameters T = 3.44 years, b = 2.11 and t0 = 1.75. As 
expert No.1 was able to give a value for the mean failure time, 
it is possible to control the results of the parameter 
determination with an expert information. Eq.(9) determines 
the mean of the failure-distribution (Ref.4).

Using the parameters of the furnace bearing results in a mean 
value of 3.24 years. The deviation from the value that was 
given by the expert is only 7.7 %. 
Further on expert No.2 shall be dealt with. He gave 
information about another part. The part stems out of a 
sandblast unit and is again a bearing. Expert No.2 could not 
give a mean of failure times. He also could not handle terms 
like probability or parameters of a distribution. The results of 
the interview with him combined with the statements of expert 
No.1 are shown in table 2. 
Expert No.2 could not give precise values. All of his 
information is combined with an imprecision band. If such 
data is given, one has to take the influence of the imprecision 
into account. The safest way to do this is to consider the 
influence of the boundary values of the imprecision bands on 
the Weibull-parameters. For the consideration that shall be 
accomplished here the imprecision of the shortest observed 
lifetime will not be included, as the volume of the examination 
would be too big. 
 
4.3 Determination of the parameter combinations 
We take 3 out of 4 parameter influencing variables into 
account; these are the longest observed lifetime, the point of 
most observed failures and the amount of replaced parts 
altogether. If 3 values are given and 2 boundary values are 
assigned to each one of them, this results in 23 = 8 possible 
combinations. Each of this combinations will reveal other 
Weibull-parameters. In doing so one can ensure, that all 
possible combinations are included.  The starting point for the 
computation are Eq.(5), Eq.(6) and Eq.(7). Eq.(6) provides 
two subsequent equations, when - basing on Eq.(7) - the 
amount of observed replacements is included.

Eq.(10) and Eq.(11) are now combined with the two 
boundary values of the longest observed lifetime and also with 
the information t0 = 1.5 years (without band). This results in 
four equations. These equations have 2 variables, namely b 
and T, and are combined with two equations, that are derived 
from Eq.(5), namely 
( ) 00mod 12 ttTb
bt b +−⋅−== and (12)
( ) 00mod 15.2 ttTb
bt b +−⋅−== . (13)
Combining these two equations with the four equations that 
were derived from Eq.(10) and Eq.(11) result in 8 possible 
different solutions for the Weibull-parameters which are given 
in table 3. 
 
4.4 Discussion 
 
The influence of an imprecision at the value of observed 
replacements has only few impact on the resulting parameters, 
as one can see in table 3. The impact is growing with a 
decreasing amount of observed replacements. 
The deviation caused by an incorrect time of the longest 
lifetime (latest replacement) has a much bigger influence on 
the results. There is also some remarkable effect on the b-
values 
The most crucial influence has the time or the interval of 
most observed replacements, as one can see, when 
contemplating table numbers 1 to 4 in comparison with 5 to 8. 
The influence on the characteristic failure time T is 
comparatively low, but there exists a big gap between the 
values of the shape parameter. 
RAMS 2004 - 93 - 0-7803-8215-3/04/$17.00 © 2004 IEEE
 It would also be possible, to include an imprecision of the 
shortest observed lifetime. This would cause the existence of 
16 instead of 8 parameter sets. The influence of expert 
knowledge imprecision can directly be seen, when considering 
figure 1, which shows the two most different parameter sets 
(combination 3 and 8 in table 3). Are these results of use for 
simulation applications and an improvement of business 
processes?

With the knowledge of employee experts it is possible to 
derive a mathematical model for the failure behavior of 
machines and facilities. It is possible to take imprecision 
bands into account. The gathered data can then be used to 
simulate business processes e.g. the maintenance strategy.  
A possible result could be, that the maintenance intervals for a 
certain facility are greater, than the interval boundary values, 
that derive from the simulation using for example combination 
3 and combination 8. So, although there exists a certain 
imprecision in input data, the result of the simulation indicates 
that a shortening of applied maintenance intervals would be 
cost-effective. 
 
5. TREATMENT OF IMPRECISION 
 
Very often - and also in the case of this study - the experts 
cannot give precise information. This might be reasoned by a 
feeling of uncertainty and the intention not to say something 
precise, which might be used later to blame the expert for 
something that went wrong. Another reason is, that the expert 
really does not know a value exactly. In chapter 4 this 
challenge was mastered. But is there any possibility for an

interviewer to get his analysis more confident? 
If we have only one expert for a certain part, machine or 
facility there will hardly be a chance to improve anything. One 
has only the possibility to make some reflections concerning 
the trustability (“good” or “bad” employee, employee’s 
attitude towards the elicitation process) of the expert. But 
additionally to that, there are some theoretical aspects, that 
support the classification of an expert’s knowledge. 
 
5.1 A possibility to deal with the risk of imprecise information 
 
Assumed there is a distribution, that exactly mirrors the 
failure behavior of a component. The expert can only reveal 
information about the time he has been working in the 
enterprise. As already mentioned in chapter 4, the influence of 
observed replacements is theoretically comparatively 
unimportant, if a certain experience is given. The risk of 
getting wrong information mainly depends on the ability of the 
expert to aggregate experiences into values. This risk is very 
important if the determination of crucial values (e.g. the shape 
parameter b) is concerned. To determine this risk of a 
deviation a case study was accomplished. In this case the risk 
is not a probability but a certain value of deviation combined 
with a lower and an upper boundary. The result shall show, 
how the amount of observed failures, the shape parameter b, 
and the difference between T and t0 influence the deviation of 
an expert estimation for the mode of the failure distribution 
from the real mode. 
 
5.2 The case study 
 
In this case study 5 experts had to estimate the mode of 
several series of Weibull distributed failure times, that were 
given to the experts. Each expert got the same series. Thus an 
influence of different failure times could be excluded. The 
series differed respectively to the shape parameter b (2, 3 and 
4), the amount of failure times (10, 20 and 40) and the 
difference between T (3, 4.5 and 6 years) and t0 ,where t0 was 
RAMS 2004 - 94 - 0-7803-8215-3/04/$17.00 © 2004 IEEE
 held constant at the value of 1.5 years. Combining these 
different parameters with each other results in 27 series of 
failure times, which were given to each expert. 
As a measure for the quality of estimation the difference 
between the real mode and the mode that has been estimated 
by the experts was calculated. Therefore the sum of the 
deviations was calculated and divided by 5. In order to 
prevent, that negative deviations delete positive ones, the 
absolute values of deviation were used. The result was as 
follows: 
Table 4 shows that the mean values of deviation increase 
with increasing differences between T and t0. The band of 
values results out of varying shape parameters and varying 
amounts of failure times. It is possible to get more precise 
information out of such a case study, if certain parameter 
combinations are considered singly. Therefore it would be 
necessary to base the results on a large amount of test experts. 
The analysis of the case study expert estimations also 
reveals, that the deviations decrease with increasing shape 
parameters. 
Increasing amounts of failure times should lead to better 
estimations, as one could expect according to classical 
reliability analysis. The case study reveals other results. Only 
in the case of low values of the shape parameter the deviations 
sink with increasing amounts of failure times. In the cases of 
higher values (b = 3 or 4) the deviations increased with 
increasing amounts of failure times. 
 
Table 4: Deviation of estimated mode values from real mode values 
T minus t0 Lower bound mean Upper bound 
1.5 0.08 years 0.19 years 0.36 years 
3 0.09 years 0.41 years 1.00 years 
4.5 0.35 years 0.93 years 3.04 years 
 
With information that stems from such case studies, it is 
possible to categorize the information that is given to an 
interviewer by an employee expert. Assumed, that the 
information, provided by the expert, is applicable and a failure 
distribution can be developed, one can use the resulting 
parameters, e.g. T minus t0, to get a clue, which states, how big 
can the deviation of the mode really be. This helps to find out 
how trustable the expert information really is. 
The case study that has been done, can not directly be 
compared with the process, that happens, when a real expert 
has to give a statement about things that happened a long time 
ago. The interface between the case study and reality is the 
fact, that in both cases a statement bases on a series of failures 
and failure times and the need to aggregate this knowledge in 
a number.
