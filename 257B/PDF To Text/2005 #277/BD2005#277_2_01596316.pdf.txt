actinides, we construct a 4-π Ge-spectrometer utilizing multiple 
gamma-ray detection method. This spectrometer consists of 30 Ge 
crystals (40 detector outputs) and 128 BGO anti-Compton shields. 
Generally, a data acquisition system for such a big Ge 
spectrometer consists of many NIM modules; it requires large 
space and huge cost. To overcome these problems, we developed a 
new data acquisition system with digital signal processing 
techniques. This system is mounted in a 19 inches VME sub-rack, 
and the cost of this system is greatly reduced. Obtained FWHMs 
(2.5 ~ 2.8 keV at 1.33 MeV) show good performances as normal 
MCA even with short shaping time and much higher channel 
density. The dead time of this system is only 3.2 micro sec per 
event. Thus good energy resolution is achieved with short shaping 
time and short dead time. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
HE aim of our study is the acquisition of neutron cross-
section data for the minor actinides (such as 237Np, 
241Am and 243Am) that are important for the development of 
innovative nuclear reactor technology. We developed a new 
advanced measurement technology for the acquirement of 
neutron cross-section data of the minor actinides [1]. In this 
technique, we construct a 4-π Ge-spectrometer utilizing 
multiple gamma-ray detection (gamma-gamma or higher-fold 
coincidence) method. Fig. 1 shows the conceptual design of 
the 4-π Ge-spectrometer. The present 4-π Ge-spectrometer will 
be for the Time Of Flight (TOF) with pulsed neutron. This 
spectrometer consists of 30 Ge crystals and BGO anti-
Compton shields. Two of these 30 crystals are segmented into 
6 channels, thus, this spectrometer has 40 Ge outputs and 128 
BGO outputs.

In multiple gamma-ray detection method, we deal multiply 
coincident signals from an array of Ge and BGO detectors. To 
make a trigger signal, we check the anti-coincidence of the 
output signals from Ge detectors and BGO detectors first, and 
we detect a coincidence pattern of the signals from the Ge 
detectors after that. Generally, a data acquisition system for 
such a Ge-spectrometer consists of NIM modules. However, 
because the coincidence pattern is very complicated and 
changed by the kinds of the experiments, many NIM modules, 
large space, and costs, which require more than US 20,000 
dollars per one Ge detector channel, are required [2].  
Recently, digital signal processing techniques and digital-
analog conversion technology improves rapidly, and a high 
density and high cost performance data acquisition system 
became possible. Because of that, the digitization of the data 
acquisition system develops rapidly in many fields such as 
physics experiments and space development [3]-[5]. 
From these backgrounds, we developed a new data 
acquisition system for the 4-π Ge-spectrometer with digital 
signal processing techniques. 
II. SYSTEM DESCRIPTION 
A. Conceptual Design 
Fig. 2 shows a conceptual design of our data acquisition 
system. The system consists of three Main ADC modules, five 
Fast Timing modules and a Coincidence module. A photo of 
the Main ADC module, the Fast Timing module and the 
Coincidence module are shown in Fig. 3. The preamplifier 
outputs of the Ge detectors are directly put into the Main ADC 
modules and the Fast Timing Modules. The outputs of BGO 
anti-Compton detectors are only put into the Fast Timing

 Modules. The Fast Timing Module discriminates detector 
signals and sends them to the Coincidence module. The 
Coincidence Module checks (anti-)coincidence of these signals 
and generates a trigger signal to the Main ADC Modules. On 
the Main ADC modules, when a trigger signal comes, the 
pulse height is analyzed by fitting or filtering digitized data. 
All modules are 9U VME boards and can be mounted in a 19 
inches VME sub-rack. The cost of this system is reduced one 
order of magnitude. 
B. Triggering  
The Fast Timing module consists of a big removable analog 
daughter board and a 9U digital board. On this analog daughter 
board, there are 32 input channels from the preamplifier 
outputs of the Ge detectors and the PMT outputs from BGO 
anti-Compton detectors. On the analog daughter board, input 
signals are shaped with a differentiation circuit, a pole-zero 
cancellation circuit, and amplification circuits. The shaped 
input signals become LVDS output signals with a Constant-
Fraction Discriminator (CFD) for judging the existence of the 
signals by the gamma rays. The 32 output signals of CFDs are 
input to the Coincidence Module. The constant of the wave 
shaping (the time constant of the differentiation circuit and the 
pole-zero cancellation circuit, and the gain of the amplification 
circuits) and the threshold values of the CFDs can be changed 
via a VME-bus or Front Panel switches. 
For the Coincidence Module, we choose a Field 
Programmable Gate Array (FPGA: XC2V2000-6FG676C, 
2M-gates 200MHz) because the coincidence condition varied 
in the experiments and we deal the input logic signals from the 
Fast Timing. The Coincidence module has the 256 LVDS 
input channels. It detects a coincidence condition with FPGA 
and makes and sends a trigger signal to the Main ADC 
modules.

 Because the program of the FPGA can be uploaded via VME-
bus, the coincidence condition can be freely changed by the 
kind of the experiments.  
In some of the experiments, we need to measure the time of 
the signal interval. That time interval is very wide from several 
ns for judging the coincidence condition to several ms for TOF 
experiments. Because of that, by using the FPGA, we can 
measure the time interval of the signals with time resolution of 
5ns and maximum range of 84 ms. 
On the Coincidence Module and Main ADC Modules, there 
are connectors for Multichannel Buffered Serial Port (McBSP). 
McBSP is a TI’s proprietary serial line implemented in DSPs 
and has a speed of 50Mbps. By using McBSP for the 
communication between the Coincidence Module and Main 
DSP Modules, it can do a more intelligence triggering, such as 
to transmit the trigger information to the DSPs on Main ADC 
modules. 
C. Energy Measurement 
Photograph of the Main ADC Module is shown in Fig. 4. 
In the Main ADC Modules, we implement Digital Signal 
Processor (DSP: TMX320VC5502APGE-300, 16bit 300MHz 
600MIPS) for each channel because we want to change a 
digital filter freely and the cost of the chip is low.  
Since detector signal is digitized in a high-speed ADC, it 
seems possible to do all analog processing such as 
differentiation and integration or filtering within the DSPs [6, 
7]. However, this necessitates longer data size for fitting and 
consumes data processing power. In addition, because our 4-π 
spectrometer will be for TOF experiments with pulsed neutron, 
event rate can be very high and there will be large pile-up. To 
prepare such large pile-up signal, without pulse shaping, we 
must reduce amplifier gain and it degrades signal-to-noise ratio. 
To prepare the pile-up without degrading the signal-to-noise 
ratio, we implement analog pulse shaping circuits on the Main 
ADC Modules.  
The Main ADC Module consists of 4 removable analog 
daughter boards and a 9U digital board. Each analog daughter 
boards has 4 input channels and each channel has analog 
circuits for differentiation, pole-zero cancellation, integrating, 
amplification and offset adjustment.  All constants of the wave 
shaping (the differential time, the integral time, the pole-zero 
cancellation, the voltage gain, and the offset adjustment) also 
can be changed using a VME-bus or Front Panel switches. The 
shaped output signals of the analog daughter boards are 
digitized with 16 ADCs (12bit 40MHz), and the digitized data 
is stored in FIFO which is implemented in an FPGA. When a 
trigger signal from the Coincidence Module is comes, the 
FIFO FPGA sends the digitized data to a DSP with a Trigger 
ID number. The pulse height is calculated by using the DSP 
and is sent to another DSP for control via McBSP lines 
connected through a CPLD. The control DSP bundled 100 sets 
of the data from the 16 channels, and put into a Dual Port 
Memory. The bundled data is read out from the Dual Port 
Memory with a PC.

 III. PERFORMANCE OF THIS SYSTEM 
To test the performance of the 4- π Ge-spectrometer and this 
system and to measure thermal neutron cross-section data, we 
installed the 4- π Ge-spectrometer and this system on a cold 
neutron beam line at a research reactor JRR-3M in Japan 
Atomic Energy Agency, before we will start TOF 
experiments[9]. 
Fig. 5 shows photos of the 4- π Ge-spectrometer and this 
system in JRR-3M. This spectrometer consists of 4 Clover 
Detectors, 2 Cluster detectors and BGO anti-Compton shields, 
and has 52 BGO outputs and 42 Ge Outputs. The 42 outputs of 
the Ge detectors are directly put into the Main ADC modules 
and the Fast Timing Modules. The outputs of BGO anti-
Compton detectors are only put into the Fast Timing Modules. 
 
A. Energy Resolution 
To test the basic performance of this DAQ, the energy 
resolution was measured with the clover detector which is a 
part of the 4-π Ge-spectrometer and a 60Co gamma source.  
Fig. 7 shows acquired traces for fully absorbed 1.33MeV 
gamma-rays (60Co). The trace shaped with analog circuits 
(Differential time: 500ns Integral time: 120ns) is shown in 
trace (a), and the trace with largest differential time (33us) and 
smallest integral time (120ns), which is almost the same as 
preamplifier output, is shown in trace (b). To compare these 
traces, the trace shaped with Moving Window Deconvolution 
(MWD) filtering[8] (filter length: 2us), which is widely used in 
digital signal processing, is also shown in trace (c). There is no 
detectable cross talk and the noise is below acceptable level 
(1.5~3.3 of least significant bit: LSB). 
In Table 1, the FWHMs of the full energy peak at 1.33MeV 
which were measured with the clover detector are shown. 
These FWHMs were shaped with FIR Filtering and MWD 
Filtering and measured with this system. To evaluate FWHM 
of this system, we also measured the gamma-ray spectrum 
with Labo: 2100C MCA and main ORTEC: 572A amplifier 
(shaping time 2us). The FWHMs show almost the same value 
for MCA and the new system, and good energy resolution 
could be achieved with short shaping time. 
 
  
B. Energy Resolution at High Energy region 
To test the energy resolution at high energy region, we 
measured prompt gamma-rays from 14N. Target was melamine 
resin 1500mg and was enclosed with FEP film. This sample 
was set on the cold neutron beam line at JRR-3M   and the 
coincidence prompt gamma-rays were measured with the 4-π 
Ge-spectrometer and this DAQ for 3 hours. In this 
measurement, the measured energy range of each detector was 
0-16MeV with 8k channels. Coincidence gate time was 800 ns. 
Fig. 6 shows a gamma-ray spectrum of channel No. 1 of the 
clover detector No.1. The strongest prompt gamma-rays from 
14N is 5269 keV, and the prompt gamma-rays at 5298 keV are 
secondly. The both photo peaks, single escape peaks, and 
double escape peaks are clearly observed. The FWHM of 5269 
keV photo peak is 6.4 keV. This is enough for our experiments. 
In this figure, although the energy of the prompt gamma-
rays from H is only 2223keV and we measured only 
coincidence events of the prompt gamma-rays, the photo peak 
of 2223keV was clearly observed. Accidental events of 
2223keV gamma-rays and the other gamma-rays are this cause.

C. Time Resolution 
To test the time resolution of our DAQ, we measured the 
time dependence of the coincidence events. In this 
measurement, we measured the coincidence prompt gamma-
rays from 14N under the same condition of the experiments in 
section B. 
Fig. 7 shows time dependence between a channel and the 
other detectors in coincidence events. The blue line shows the 
time dependence of the channel No. 1 of the clover detector 
No.1. The red line shows that of the channel No. 2. And the 
green line shows in case of timing miss match. 
  
In the multiple gamma-rays detection, we have to match the 
timing of the all detectors. In this system, FPGA on the 
coincidence module has logic delay, and we can match the 
timing. Using this time dependence, we easily matched the 
timing, and what is more, we easily estimated the ratio of the 
coincidence (true) events to the accidental (noise) events. In 
short, this is the powerful tool for multiple gamma-rays 
detection method. 
The FWHMs of these peaks were about 120 ns. On the other 
hand, FWHM which was measured with the 4-π Ge-
spectrometer and the ORTEC: 567 TAC and Labo: 2100C 
MCA was about 110 ns. Good time resolution has been 
achieved.  
Measuring the least time difference between the coincidence 
events (not the detectors in same events), we estimated the 
dead time of this system. The estimated dead time of our DAQ 
was 3.2 us. This is enough short for our TOF experiments. 
IV. CONCLUSION 
We have described the design and the performance of a new 
data acquisition system for the 4-π Ge-spectrometer with 
digital signal processing techniques. In the tests with the  4- π 
Ge-spectrometer, enough energy resolution at both normal and 
high energy region, and good time resolution can be achieved 
with short dead time.
