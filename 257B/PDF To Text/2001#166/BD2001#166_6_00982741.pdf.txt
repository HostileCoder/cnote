Abstract 
Landscape Ecology is a new field of the macro-ecological research. Study on the Landscape pattern change is a research hotspot of the 
landscape ecology at present. The main research methods in this paper are stated as follow: using remote sensing data to get the basic 
landscape pattern data of Jinta Oasis in 1990 and 2000; calculating four landscape indexes by utilizing the statistics function of GIs; 
using ArcView spatial analysis module to convert the landscape mosaics of the research region into 5mX5m grids and calculate the 
transition matrix of the landscape mosaics. The results show: First, the change of landscape pattern in oasis relates with the change of 
water resource. The quantity of the Jinta Oasis water resource changes indistinctively, however, its utilization ratio has increased greatly, 
which results in a big increasing of irrigation land. Secondly, Jinta Oasis would have been the tendency of desertification. Thirdly, 
county, towns and villages expand quickly and mainly on the bare and unused land. The town inhabitant region in Jinta Oasis has the 
tendency of citification.

1 Introduction 
Landscape Ecology is a new field of the macro-ecological research. Study on the Landscape pattern change is a research hotspot of 
the landscape ecology at present (Xiao Duning, et. al. 1990). Landscape pattern, which refers to spatial pattern in general, is the spatial 
array formation of all the landscape elements in different size and shape. It is the embodiment of landscape inhomogeneity and the result 
when all kinds of ecology procession work in various scales. The reason of the landscape pattern change lies on the interference of nature 
environment, all kinds of creature and mankind activity. The notable change of landscape pattern has three kinds of typical types: (a) one 
kind of landscape element substitutes another kind of landscape element; (b) the landscape ratio of several kinds of landscape element 
vanes; (c) new landscape element emerge in the landscape system (Wang Yanglin, 1995). 
The oasis landscape in arid region, which stroma is desert, is a kind of very complex landscape structure with undefined different 
vegetation ecology systems, which are composed of the systems based on wateriincluding hungriness vegetation and salt and swamp 
meadow vegetation and arbor and shrubbery vegetation distributing along water system and manual ecology systems such as farmland, 
man-made forest web and grassland (Wang Gengxu, Cherig Guodorrg, 1999). Study on landscape pattern change stared very early such as 
Study on landscape pattern change of west suburb of ShengYang (Xiao Duning, et. al. 1990) and Analysis on landscape spatial pattern of 
loess region (Fu Bojie, 1995). However, it is only in the latter several years that we begin to study on the oasis landscape pattern in 
Chinese arid regions, which mainly include Zhangye oasis and Ejin Banner oasis in the middle and lower stream of HeiHe Basin (Wang 
Gengxzi, Cheng Guodong, 1999, 2000). In the same time, study on ecology landscape has penetrated to the study on desertification of the 
arid regions (Wang Tao, et. al., 1999). 
The research region of this paper, Jinta oasis lies between 98 39’ -99 08’ E and 39 56‘ -40 17’ N. The total area is 1652.2km2. It 
lies in the northeast of JiuQuan district, north side of middle of Hexi comdor. The total average precipitation in one year is about 
59.5mm and annual evapotranspiration is about 2538.6mm. Jinta region is very flat, which elevation difference is only 80 meters. Its 
earthiness is very good mainly including mud soil, tide soil (meadow soil), wind sand soil and typical gray brown soil which distributes 
in the edge regions. Because the oasis soil is continuous and easy to reclaim, this region is set as one of the national land resource 
developing and representative areas in China (Chen Chaowurn 2000).

2 Data on land utilization, landscape mosaic type division and its application. 
2.1 Data on the land utilization 
The original data of dynamic change of Jinta oasis ecology landscape is derived from 863 West Gold Eye Action-the project of 
retreating farmland and returning grassland and woodland in Gansu Province Heihe River Basin Experiment Regions. Two Landsat TM 
images were used. One is August 30th, 1990 and the other is July 8th, 2000. The fourth, third and second bands were composite as the 
red, green and blue band. The land cover/land use d 
2.2 Landscape mosaic type division and its implica 
The landscape mosaic type division in this paper re e type division method used by Prof. Xiao Duning in the west suburb of 
ShengYang (Xiuo Duning, et. al. 1990) and Prof. 'ertgxu in Heihe River Basin (Wung Cengxu, Cheng Cuodong, 2000). 
According to the land characteristic of the test regions, the classification principle is mainly based on the agriculture usefulness and also 
takes account into the utilization path of landscape mosaics. The following items show us the landscape mosaic types of the arid region 
oasis: 
ained by the manual interpretation method. 
I Irrigation land: The farmland including the campestral shelterbelt that can be irrigated permanently or periodically by using a series 
of fixed equipment. 
I1 Non-irrigated field: The cultivated land that depends on nature rainfall without irrigation water resource and equipment. 
111 Forestland: The nature and artificial forests except the green land in the factory and mine regions and the shelter forest. 
IV Shrubbery: The bush and the transition zone of bush and forest which height is less than three meters or which height are more than 
3m but the cover close degree are less than 30%. 
V Garden land: The land where multi-year woody and herbaceous plants are planted and intensively managed mainly for collecting 
flower, fruit, stem and root. The cover degree is more than 50%, or the reasonable numbers of the plants is more than 70%. It includes 
orchard garden and greenhouse. 
VI City and town inhabitant land: The land of the city and town, factory and mine, traffic and some special utilization land. 
VI1 Water region: The natural or artificially digging water fields, including river, ditch reservoir, lake, pool and irrigation works. 
wl Sand land: The land covered by sand mainly, the vegetation cover degree of which is less than 5%,  including active dune. 
IX Bare soil, bare rock and gravel land: The land consists of bare soil, bare rock and gravel land, which are mainly derived of natural 
corrosion and ecology degradation. 
X Grassland: The salted grassland, the gravel and sandiness gobi hungriness sandy grassland, not including bushy grassland the 
transition zones of bush and grassland 
3 Research methods 
3.1 RS and GIS 
Comparing with other data resource, Remote Sensing (RS) data has a lot of advantages such as repetitive acquirement. It is a important 
domain for the RS data application to use multi-time images to analyze the object dynamic change. Landsat TM5's special resolution is 
30 meters. It covers the whole globe every 16 days and includes seven bands. Each band indicates different ecology characteristic. The 
vegetation and land classification is one of the important applications of RS data in landscape ecology (Li Bo, er al., 2000). 
Geographic Information System (GIS) is a powerful tool that can collect, store, extract, transform and display spatial data. It also is the 
necessary tool for using RS data effectively and studying the landscape pattern and its dynamic change. The applications of GIs in 
landscape ecology mainly include: to analyze the landscape special change; to calculate the relation between different environment and 
ecology character; to determine the size, shape, adjacency and continuity of the mosaics; to analyze the direction and flux of energy, 
substance and biology flow; to output the landscape variable images; to use with other simulation models (Li Bo, er al., 2000). The 
processing and statistic of all the vector data and grid data in this paper use ArcView GIS Version3.0a, and special analysis module.

m is the number of the mosaics type, Ek and Ak is the perimeter and area of the Kth type mosaics, Pi is the area percentage of the Ith 
type landscape. A is the total area of research region. P and A are the perimeter and area of mosaics respectively. 
(2) transition matrix 
As an important research method, transition matrix is used to analysis the transition situation of all kinds of landscape mosaics. In this 
paper, grid method is used to calculate the transition matrix. Supported by ArcView Spatial Analysis, the vector landscape mosaics are 
converted into 5x 5 area meter grids. Because the smallest landscape mosaic of the research region includes more than 300 grids and the 
eighty percent grids of landscape mosaics is more than 3000 grids, one grid’s influence to the mosaic slightly and it can be neglected 
when there are two kinds of mosaics in one grid. Then the radio Rij for one type of mosaic converting into another in the transition 
n 
matrix can be express as: R, = 25 X (c Lkj) / Ai. Where, Lkj is the grid number of the kth mosaics of the ith type mosaics 
k=l 
converted into the jth type mosaics. Ai is the total area of the ith type mosaics. Through calculating the indexes of differenr periods, we 
can quantitatively analysis the dynamic change of ecology landscape of research region.

4.1 Basic parameters 
According to the statistics of the mosaic number, parameter and area, the basic parameters can be output. They are shown in table 1. 
From table 1,  we can find that the landscape pattern of Jinta Oasis has changed greatly in the latter ten years. The stroma in these two 
periods is both bare soil, bare rock and gravel land, the quantity of which almost unchanged. The area of city and town inhabitant land, 
forestland and desert increases greatly. The area of grassland, bush land, non-irrigated land and garden land decrease obviously. The

irrigated land area rise 26% and the total number of mosaics decreases 41%, which indicates the distribution of mosaics is more 
centralized and the fragmentation becomes lower. On the contrary, the mosaic number of stroma increases 44% and the fragmentation 
increases. The total number of mosaics reduces from 363 to 328 and the average kea of mosaics increase from 455ha to 504ha so the 
fragmentation is decreasing.

4.2 The average ratio of perimeter and area of landscape mosaics, diversity, fragmentation and dimension 
The table 2 and figure 1 list the part of landscape index values. We can extract the following landscape pattern change character: @ 
The average ratio of perimeter and area of mosaics reduces 10% from 1990 to 2000, which shows that the mosaics shapes of the Jinta 
oasis are smoother than before. @The diversity of landscape ecology of 2000 is higher than that of 1990, which shows that the land 
tends to be diversified and well-distributed. @Cornpafed with 1999,the whole fragmentation of 2000 decreases and the landscape 
tends to be well-distributed. The fragmentation of irrigated land, non-irrigated land and forestland decrease and their distribution tends 
continuous. The fragmentation of bare soil, bare rock and gravel land increases, furthermore, it is segmentalized by continuous irrigated 
land and become more fragmental. Figure 2 lists the dimension values of each type of mosaic from 1990 to 2000. Most mosaics’ 
dimension change little except non-irrigated land, water region and sand land.

4.3 Landscape transition matrix 
Table3 lists the transition matrix of each mosaic type from 1990 to 2000. Fig 4 shows the distribution map of the main landscape pattern 
change of Jinta Oasis. The irrigate land, bare land, bare rock, gravel land, grassland, forestland change greatly. Generally, non-irrigated 
land and garden land convert to other mosaic types and their area decreases. Above analysis shows the area of the city and town 
178 
Fig, 4 Distribution map of the main landscape pattern change in Jinta Oasis 
inhabitant land in 2000 rises three times than 1990, so further analysis is performed. The transition ratio only can directly show the 
degree not the quantity of one mosaic type converts to another. For example, the quantity of imgated land is 46 times of the 
non-irrigated land. The contribution of 10% of non-irrigated land to the city and town habitant land is much less than that of 2.9% of 
irrigation land. So we adopt transition quantity to analyze the transition and expanding situation of the city and town inhabitant land. 
The contribution of bare soil, bare rock and gravel land to town inhabitant land is the greatest and reaches 38.7%. The contribution of 
imgated land and grassland reach 21.7% and 14.4% respectively. 
4.4 The analysis on the influence of water resource to landscape pattern change 
On general, the river corridors strictly influence the oasis landscape pattern and the spatial distxibution of its composing type. In the 
research region, the landscape change mainly lies in the ecology fragility regions such as the oasis fringe and the edge of rivers and 
ditches, which shows that the change of landscape pattern in Jinta oasis relates to the change of water resource. The main irrigated ways 
are river (or ditch) and well. In Jinta oasis, the quantity of each way is 154.6 km2 and 94.9 km’. The main imgation way is ditch in Jinta 
oasis. The water resource is supplied by mandarin ducks pool reservoir and liberation village reservoir. The water quantity of which is 
analyzed and shown in figure 3. It can be shown that in the latter ten years the contribution of mandarin ducks pool reservoir to Jinta 
oasis changes a little. But the imgated area of the imsated land expands greatly. It is mainly derived of increasing of the utilization ratio 
of water resource. For example, when building the inlay of main and branch ditch, the cryoprotective technology, U ditch technology, 
lower pressure pipe, spray and drop and seep irrigation technology are used. So the wasteful water decreases and the imgated area 
increases in oasis. Furthermore, the agriculture structure adjunction advances the upgrade of the industry structure. As a result, the 
agriculture production value of Jinta oasis rise to 2.9 hundred million of 1996 from 0.7 hundred million of 1990. 
5 Conclusions 
From above analysis, we can see Jinta oasis landscape change greatly, which is similar with the change of other oasis in the arid regions. 
(1) The stroma of Jinta oasis in research region is desert, the area of which is more than 65%. The stroma’s fragmentation increases 
gradually and the dominance becomes lower. 
(2) The landscape change regions mainly distribute in the ecology frail regions of oasis fringe and the edge of river and ditch, which 
show the change of landscape pattern in Jinta oasis relate with the change of water resource. The total water resource of Jinta Oasis is 
almost unchanged, however, the utilization ratio of which has increased greatly, which result in the big change of irrigation land. 
(3) Two big piece of new sand land emerge in the middle-up and right down of the oasis, which shows that Jinta Oasis has the tendency 
and dangerous of desertification. 
(4) Land of cities, towns and villages expand quickly which shows that Jinta Oasis has the tendency of citification. The following 
, 
179 
statistic data also prove it. The number of non-agriculture population in Jinta rise to 23 thousand in 2000 from 13 thousand in 1990. 
Further analysis shows that the land of cities expands mainly on the unused land. 
(5)DuMg the analysis process, RS is the important method to support basic data resource and GIS is an important tool for analyzing 
data. Especially when the vector data convert into grid data, we can calculate the landscape transition matrix and analyze the distribution 
of landscape pattern change regions conveniently and quickly, which is the base of analyzing the landscape pattern change. The 
combination of RS and GIS with landscape research will supply the effective method for evaluating the situation of oasis ecology 
system.
