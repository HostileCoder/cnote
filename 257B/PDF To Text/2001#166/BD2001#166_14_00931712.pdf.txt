Abstract - A new approach for the early establishment of 
robust colonies on Mars is proposed. The colonies, which 
would be located on the North Polar Cap of Mars, would utilize 
the readily available water ice and the Martian atmosphere to 
produce virtually all of the supplies - H, and 0, propellants, 
hydrocarbon fuels and propellants, breathable air, plastics, 
food, etc. - needed by the colony. The colonists would live in 
thermally insulated large, comfortable habitats beneath the ice 
surface, where they would be fully shielded from cosmic 
radiation. 
The habitats and supplies would be produced and stockpiled 
by a compact, nuclear powered robotic device termed ALPH 
(Atomic Liberation of Propellant and Habitat) which would 
land on the Ndrth Polar Cap two years before the colonists 
arrived. Each ALPH unit would have a compact, lightweight 
five MW(th) nuclear reactor with an integral small 1 MW(e) 
steam turbine generator, which would power a suite of small 
process units (H,O electrolyzer, H, and O2 liquefiers, COJ" 
separator (Martian atmosphere has 2% N2), methanator, plastic 
polymizer, food producer, etc. Two ALPH units, each 
weighing -4 metric tons, in two years would produce and 
stockpile in melt cavities under the ice over 300 tons of liquid 
H,, 3000 tons of liquid oxygen, 60 tons of liquid methane, 60 
tons of methanol, 60 tons of plastic, and many tons of food, 
along with a large number of thermally insulated habitats. All 
of. these materials and habitats would be in place when the 
colonists landed. 
Using the already stockpiled supplies, and the additional 
supplies that would continue to be produced by the ALPH 
units, the colonists would construct and operate rovers and 
flyers to extensively explore the Martian surface beyond the 
North Polar Cap. 
Also described is MICE (Mars Ice Cap Explorer), which is  a 
precursor mission in which a small ALPH-like reactor unit 
would travel deep (- 1 kilometer) inside the North Polar Cap, 
collecting data on its internal structure, the composition and 
properties of the ancient Martian atmosphere, and possible 
evidence of ancient life forms (microfossils, traces of DNA, 
etc.) that were deposited either by wind or as remnants of the 
ancient North Polar ocean.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The exploration of Mars, at least as presently envisaged, is a 
long process involving a sequence of individual missions 
(Figure I), each of which must carry from Earth almost all of the 
supplies needed for a trip to Mars, the exploration itself, and 
the return trip to Earth. As Zubrin [ I ]  and others have 
proposed, some supplies can be produced on Mars (e.g., 
methane and oxygen from atmospheric CO,, using hydrogen 
transported from Earth). However, the amount produced is 
modest, and does not substantially reduce expedition mass 
requirements. 
Each mission requires lifting at least 500 metric tons into Low 
Earth Orbit (LEO). Moreover, the drive to minimize mission 
cost and launch requirements inevitably drives down margins 
on the amounts of propellants, consumables, etc. that are 
carried, decreases safety margins on equipment, and increases 
risk. 
In the past on Farth, exploration has been the most successful 
when explorers continuously occupied bases on the new 
lands, and used local resources. The same pattern would 
appear to hold for Mars. If Mars were habitable and 
hospitable, such a pattern would be followed there. However, 
the absence of water and breathable air has seemed to exclude 
this possibility. There has been great interest and speculation 
about whether or not there is water on Mars. Curiously, this 
fascination with the finding water has virtually ignored the fact

that thousands of cubic kilometers of ice in the North Polar 
regions, are readily accessible to support a colony. 
Figure 2 outlines a different exploration approach, based on 
establishing a robust colony on the North Polar Cap of Mars. 
In contrast to the multiple mission approach, the colony would 
be established at the beginning of the exploration of Mars, not 
at a distant point in time after a number of individual missions. 
A compact, lightweight robotic factory unit would land on the 
North Polar Cap at the site of the future colony. The robotic 
unit, termed ALPH (Atomic Liberation of Propellant and 
Habitat) would produce and stockpile essentially all of the 
supplies (air, water, food, fbel, etc.) plus a large reserve margin, 
needed by the colony before the colonists arrived. The ALPH 
unit would also create h e  cavities inside the ice cap to  
provide comfortable, shielded habitats. 
The supplies and habitats would be in place when the 
colonists arrived, ready for use. From the stockpiled materials, 
the colonists would construct rovers and flyers for a large 
scale manned and unmanned exploration of Mars. All of Mars 
surface could be reached from the North Polar colony, 
including even the South Polar region. Propellants and 
supplies would be lifted into Mars orbit and stockpiled in a 
depot for return trips to Earth. Moreover, additional propellant 
and supplies would be transported back to a second depot in 
high Earth orbit, to be used for outbound trips to Mars. 
The above Earth - Mars - Earth transport architecture, plus the 
productiosn on Mars of virtually all of the colony's material 
needs, would enable the colony to rapidly expand to a level of 
hundreds of persons with minimum IMLEO (Initial Mass in 
Low Earth Orbit) launch requirements, as compared to the 
currently envisaged approach. This and the much greater 
exploration capability, make the colony approach extremely 
attractive for Mars exploration. 
2. THE NORTH POLAR COLONY CAP AS A SITE 
Figure 3 illustrates the advantages of the North Polar Cap as 
the base for a Mars colony. First, and most important, there is 
a plentiful supply of readily accessible H,O locked up as ice. 
Water is the essential ingredient for a practical Mars colony. 
Without it, there could be no colony, and Mars would remain 
a dead world, visited occasionally by small exploration 
missions from Earth. With it, and the Martian CO, atmosphere, 
virtually all of the materials needed to comfortably support a 
major colony can be synthesized. 
Moreover, what at first sight appears to be a drawback - the 
presence of H,O as an ice sheet, rather than as underground 
water - 11s a major advantage. It enables robotic units to land 
and process H,O from the ice into materials that can be easily 
stored in melt cavities created under the surface, as well as 
shielded habitats for the colonists when they land. Having the 
supplies and habitats already in place when the colonists land, 
rather then having to make them after they land, is a 
tremendous advantage. It decreases mission risk, since the

colonists will not leave Earth until they know that the supplies 
and habitats are in place, and it greatly reduces the work 
demands on the colonists when they land, enabling them to 
concentrate on exploration. In an odd way, Mars is a mirror 
image of Earth. On Earth, the vast ice sheets of Antarctica and 
Greenland, and the pack ice of the Arctic Ocean, are deserts, 
with the fertile continents being the oases. It is no wonder 
that these ice deserts were the last places on Earth to be 
explored. 
On Mars, however, the North Polar Cap is the oasis, and the 
surrounding regions of the planet are its deserts. Logically, it 
appears better to explore the deserts from a robust, capable 
base located in the oasis, than attempting to set up camps in 
the inhospitable deserts. Moreover, as illustrated in Figure 3, 
the North Polar Cap appears to be a very attractive site for 
scientific research by itself. Samples obkiined from inside the 
ice sheet will provide data on the composition and 
meteorology of the Martian atmosphere over millions of years, 
on the geology of the wind borne dust collected by the ice 
cap, on ancient solar wind and cosmic ray activity, and 
possibly, evidence of life on Mars, through microfossils, DNA 
traces, etc. 
More detailed information on the internal structure of the ice 
cap, and of possible landing sites, is needed. There appears 
to  be a relatively small region of pure H 2 0  ice in the cap. This 
region, estimated to be 837 km2 in area and at least 1 km thick 
[2], is surrounded by hundreds of thousands of square 
kilometers of layered polar terrain. Eroded channels in this 
region exhibit an internal structure of alternating layers of ice 
and dust. Typically, the ice layers are on the order of 10 to 30 
meters thick, and are separated by thinner layers of dusty 
material, probably an ice-dust composite. 
Quantitative data on the dust content in this portion of the Ice 
Cap, both locally and overall, is lacking. Carr [3] assumes for 
purposes of estimating the total inventory of H20 on Mars that 
the average dudice content is 500//50%. However, visual 
observations suggest that the dust content is substantially 
less than 50%. Also, there probably is considerable spatial 
variation, since the more northerly regions would tend to have 
a smaller dust content since most of the dust would have been 
trapped out at lower latitudes. 
Having a dusty ice cap rather than a pure ice one does not 
appear to  be a serious problem as long as it did not hinder 
access to or processing the ice. Dust contents as high as 20 
to 30% by volume could be handled since melt channels and 
cavities could still be created inside the ice sheet. The dust 
would be filtered or centrihged out, and the purified water 
then used to make propellants, food, oxygen, etc. 
The presence of dust in the ice cap would actually be 
beneficial, since it would be used as a feed material for 
processes to make aluminum, iron, and other metals, as well as 
ceramics based on silica, magnesia, etc. This would eliminate 
the need to make long trips to collect such material from lower 
latitudes. 
Compact, ultra lightweight mobile robotic devices landed on 
the ice cap prior to the establishment of the colony, one could 
gather detailed data on the internal structure of the cap, 
including the content and composition of the dust, and how it 
varied vertically and horizontally within the cap. The small 
robotic devices, termed MICE (Mars Ice Cap Explorer), would 
travel veirtically and horizontally through melt channels inside 
the ice cap, collecting data for transmittal back to Earth. 
Details ofthe MICE probes are described below. 
Figure 4 illustrates a possible road map for the establishment 
of the Mars colony. The first ALPH unit would land in 2016, 
manufacturing and stockpiling supplies for the first colonists, 
who would land in 2018. The initial landing party would 
consist of 10 astronauts. Additional groups of colonists 
would continue to land at intervals determined by the Earth to 
Mars launch windows. 
The colony would attain a mature population of 500 persons 
by 2034, sixteen years after the first human landing. A net 
return to Earth of approximately 20% of the colony population 
would occur every 2 years. Colonist groups of up to 22 
persons would travel in each habitat vehicle that traveled back 
and forth between Earth and Mars. 
3. EXPLORATION OF THE ICE CAP BY MICE PROBES 
Obtaining data on the internal structure of the ice cap, in 
particular, the amount, properties, and spatial distribution of its 
dust content, is important in the selection of a site for the Mars 
colony. This data would be obtained from small robotic 
probes, termed MICE (Mars Ice Cap Explorer) that would land 
on the i d a c e  of the ice cap. Using a compact, ultra 
lightweight nuclear reactor as a source of heat and electric 
power, the probe would melt its way down through the ice, 
collecting data on the dust content and its properties, as well 
as information about the composition of the ancient Martian 
atmosphere, solar and cosmic ray activity, and possible 
evidence of Martian life forms, including wind borne 
microfossils and DNA traces. 
Figure 5 shows how MICE would move vertically and 
horizontally through the ice cap, along a melt channel that it 
creates using warm water jets powered by heat from the 
reactor. The MICE unit tows a small instrument package 
behind it. Data from the instrument package is relayed back to 
the surface landerhnsmitter along a trailing optical fiber. The 
data is then transmitted from the surfaceflander back to Earth.

Details of the MICE concept are described elsewhere [4]. 
Figure 6 shows the MICE reactor and instrument package in 
its melt channel, which is approximately 1 meter in diameter. 
The melt channel refreezes to ice a few meters behind the 
moving reactor and its instrument package, locking in the 
optical fiber link to the surface lander. The MICE probe can 
travel vertically downwards or at an angle, with the angle of 
descent determined by appropriate control of the angle and 
rate of flow from the array of water jets positioned at the 
base of the reactor.

MICE can also travel vertically upwards after it reaches the 
bottom of its planned downwards trajectory through the ice 
cap. MICE simply creates a melt pool several meters in 
diameter, and by adjusting the balance of its attached 
buoyancy chambers, reverses its vertical orientation by 180 
degrees, so that it starts to travel upwards through the ice 
sheet instead of downwards. As with the downwards 
movement, the upwards trajectory can either be purely 
vertical or at an angle determined by the water jet flow 
pattern. 
MICE probes could thus explore the ice cap vertically and 
horizontally, descending to depths on the order of a 
kilometer, and traveling horizontally for distances 
considerably greater than 1 kilometer. A closeup view of the 
MICE reactor, its warm water jet system, and its buoyancy 
chambers is shown in Figure 7, together with a mini steam 
turbine for electric power, which is driven by 200" C steam 
generated by the reactor. Table 1 summarizes the principal 
design parameters for the MICE probes. The operating 
conditions are very conservative, and the reactor and power 
generation components are well within the existing 
technology base. Development of the MICE instrument 
package may require some research and development (R&D) 
on new instruments.

During the first few days of operation, the ALPH reactor would 
sink to a location about 30 meters below the ice surface, where 
it would remain for the rest of its operating life. At this depth, 
the habitats and storage cavities are fully shielded from the 
reactor. After touchdown, the lander would also horizontally 
deploy flexible lines that circulate warm water from the reactor. 
These lines sink into the ice, as illustrated in Figure 8. After 
reaching the designated depth, the warm water circulation 
pattern is altered to create appropriately sized cavities inside 
the ice sheet. These cavities would stockpile liquid 
propellants and supplies produced by ALPH and also serve as 
habitats for the colonists. 
Figure 9 shows two possible methods for melting a cavity 
inside the ice sheet. In both approaches, a flexible, thin wall, 
collapsed plastic balloon surrounds the warm water melt line 
at an appropriate point along its length. When the warm water 
line has melted its way down to the desired depth, additional 
warm pressurized water is pumped into the collapsed balloon, 
causing it to expand againsr, and start to melt, the surrounding 
ice. 
In the warm water filled balloon approach (left picture in Figure 
9), the inlet water circulates throughout the whole balloon, 
while in the heated surface balloon approach (right side of 
Figure 9), the warm water only circulates through the network 
of flow channels on the surface of the balloon. The interior of 
the balloon is filled with pressurized water, which keeps the 
balloon inflated, and its hot surface pressed against the 
surrounding ice. 
The heated skin approach has two advantages. First, it 
reduces the volume of warm water required; second, after the 
cavity has been created, the water in the network of surface 
channels is flushed out and replaced with a thermally 
insulating gas blanket. The gas would be air, &, CO,, or H,, 
depending on the nature and temperature of the cavity 
contents. Certain materials produced by ALPH would be 
stored at a lower temperature than the surrounding ice sheet - 
for example, liquid H,, liquid 0,, liquid air, and liquid methane - 
while other materials would be stored at a higher temperature 
than the surrounding ice - for example, water, methanol, 
plastics, and food. The habitats for the colonists would also 
be kept at a higher temperature than the surrounding ice. 
In the first case, the heat leak into the cavity from the ice is 
minimized by the cellular gas blanket in order to keep the 
power demand on the cryogenic refrigerators as small as 
possible. In the second case, the heat leak out of the cavity is 
kept small, in order to minimize space heating requirements, 
and to prevent local melting of the surrounding ice. 
m e  cavities can be created in a short time using the waste 
heat from the ALPH nuclear reactor. For example, creating a 
cylindrical cavity 10 meters in diameter and 15 meters long 
would take only 25 days and require about 500 KW(th) of heat. 
This corresponds to -12% of ALPH's reject heat from the 
steam cycle, so that a total of 8 such cavities could be created 
in a little more than 3 weeks. After formation, the cavities can 
be sealed using a freeze seal technique, in which the entrance 
to the cavity is closed off with an ice plug created by injection 
of water and subsequent freezing by the surrounding ice.

Figure 10 shows the ALPH production flowsheet. All of the 
process units utilize existing technology, with water, CO, 
and N, as the basic feed materials. The water comes from 
melting of the local ice, while CO, and N, came from the 
Martian atmosphere. The separation into CO, and N, gas 
streams can be done using either a simple temperature swing 
absorption (TSA) process with a fixed bed of molecular 
sieve beads, or by a compressor I liquefaction cycle. 
The water electrolysis process would use a high 
performance solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) with an 
electrical efficiency on the order of 90%. The O2 would be 
liquefied for future use in propulsion engines, fuel cells, etc., 
or mixed with N2 and stored as liquid air for future use as 
breathable air. Hydrogen and carbon dioxide would be 
reacted to fonn methane, methanol, and plastics. Methane 
or methanol can be used as substrates for growth of yeasts 
and bacteria in fermentation vessels will yield food supplies 
that contain protein, fats, and carbohydrates. Ethanol can 
also be synthesized for use as a substrate for food 
production. 
Table 2 lists the principal parameters of one 5 MW(th) 
ALPH factory unit, together with an inventory of the 
hundreds of tons of supplies that it would produce and 
stockpile in the 2 year period before the first colonists 
landed. The total weight of the factory is approximately 4 
metric tons, which is tiny compared to the amount of 
supplies that it would produce. Two ALPH units would be 
landed prior to the colonists arrival. 
As with the MICE probes, ALPH would be tested and fully 
demonstrated on Earth ice sheets located, for example, in 
Greenland, Antarctica, or Alaska, before it was launched to 
Mars. Because ALPH is based on existing processes and

technologies, it could be fully developed and ready for use 
on Mars in a relatively short time, on the order of 7 to 8 
years. Besides supporting an extremely robust Mars 
colony, ALPH has the very great advantage that it would 
stockpile of the materials that it produced, which would be 
in place even before the colonists left Earth. 
5.  THE MITEE NUCLEAR PROPULSION SYSTEM 
Nuclear propulsion is a key technology element for a Mars 
colony. It greatly reduces the mass of propellant required 
and shortens the trip time to and from Mars. 
Compact lightweight nuclear thermal propulsion (NTP) 
engines would provide transport back and forth between 
Earth orbit and Mars orbit. Using H, propellant, NTP 
engines achieve specific impulses of -1000 seconds, 
compared to H,/O, chemical engines, which deliver only 450 
seconds. The higher specific impulse greatly reduces the 
mass of propellant needed for transport between Earth and 
Mars, as compared to chemical engines. Chemical engines 
would still be used from planetary surface to orbit, both on 
Earth and Mars. 
There has been extensive Research and Development on 
nuclear thermal propulsion engines in the US and the USSR 
over the past 50 years. In the US, successful ground tests 
of complete NERVA NTP engines were carried out in the 
1960's [6]. Successll tests of NERVA type assemblies were 
also carried out in the USSR. NERVA, however, was 
inherently large and heavy with a mass of several tons. 
In the mid 1980's, the US SNTP (Space Nuclear Thermal 
Propulsion) program aimed at the development of a much 
1 - 2 2 5  
smaller and lighter NTP engine based on the Particle Bed 
Reactor (PBR) for defense applications [7]. Goals for the 
1000 megawatt PBR NTP engine were a total mass of -500 
kilograms, with a thrust to weight ratio of 30/1. PBR engine 
components were developed and successfully tested. 
Ground tests of full-up engines were planned but not carried 
out when the SNTP program ended at the close of the Cold 
War. 
More recently, even smaller and lighter NTP engine designs 
have been studied for space exploration missions. In 
particular, the Mnature Reacxor En- (MITEE) NTP 
engine is projected to have a mass of approximately 200 
kilograms, with an outer diameter of the 75 megawatt reactor 
being only 50 centimeters. The MITEE engine is based on 
the existing strong technology base and could be developed 
in as little as 5 years.Figure 11 illustrates the features of the 
MITEE nuclear engine [8, 91. The reactor core is a close 
packed array of 37 separate beryllium metal pressure tubes, 
each of which contains an inner annular fuel zone that is 
enclosed by an outer lithium hydride moderator zone. Cold 
hydrogen propellant enters at the top end of each pressure 
tube, and flows longitudinally down through an outer 
plenum that is located between the pressure tube and 
moderator region. 
Some of the plenum H, peels off the main longitudinal flow 
and flows radially inwards towards the axis of the pressure 
tube. The radial flow first passes through the outer 
moderator zone, and then through the inner fuel zone. The 
local radial flow rate of the hydrogen is controlled by the 
local effective porosity of the fie1 zone, which is fabricated 
so that hydrogen exit temperature (-3000 K) out of the fuel 
region into the central hot gas flow channel is the same at all 
points inside the reactor. This power to flow matching 
capability, which allows the mixed mean temperature of the 
hot exit propellant to reach its maximum possible value, 
results in the highest specific impulse possible. 
The MITEE-type fuel element enables extremely high power 
densities, and consequently, very compact and lightweight 
nuclear propulsion engines. Similar type fuel elements were 
tested in the SNTP-PBR nuclear propulsion program, and 
demonistrated the capability to operate at a power density of 
30 megawatts per liter of fuel region. 
The MITEE engine improves on the PRR engine in two 
important aspects. First, it uses an array of separate 
individual pressure tubes for the reactor, instead of a bundle 
of fuel elements inside a common pressure vessel. This 
simplifies reactor construction, as well as its development 
and testing. MITEE development would focus on validating 
the performance of a single fuel/moderator tube, which 
would then be replicated to form the complete reactor 
assembly. In contrast, reactors with an integrated 
core/vessel must test the complete assembly, and require 
much longer development time and cost.

perform a wide range of exploration missions, both 
unmanned and manned. Employed as a single engine that 
would operate in deep space after a safe orbit had been 
established, MITEE can propel faster, direct trajectory 
unmanned exploration missions to the outer planets - e.g., 2 
years to Jupiter, 3 years to Saturn, 5 years to Pluto - as well 
as missions not possible with chemical engines - e.g., 
Europa sample return, Pluto orbiter, etc. The IMLEO launch 
vehicles used for these MITEE missions will be 
considerably smaller than if upper stage chemical engines 
were used.

Used in deep space, nuclear propulsion reactors do not 
pose any safety or environmental problems. The residual 
radioactivity is extremely small - the firing of a MITEE 
engine would generate only I O 6  of the long lived residual 
radioactivity present in a typical Earth based power reactor, 
and lo-* of the radioactivity already present in Earth's 
biosphere. Moreover, the spent MITEE engines would 
travel in deep space on non-returning trajectories, and 
would never impact Earth or Mars. 
6. EARTH-M ARS-EARTH TRANSPORT ARCHITECTURE 
Figure 12 illustrates the proposed architecture for the 
transport of colonists to and from Mars. Two fueling depots 
are assumed, the first in high Earth orbit - nominally GEO, 
though other high orbit locations could be used - and the 
...' 
boosted to GEO or transported to Mars orbit. 
Starting from Earth, a habitat vehicle with an attached OTV 
(Orbital Transfer Vehicle) vehicle is launched by a Saturn V 
class booster into LEO (Stage 1 in Figure 12A). The habitat 
vehicle mass is 93 metric tons, and is sized for a maximum 
crew capacity of 22 persons. After reaching LEO, the 
habitat is raised to GEO using its attached OTV, which is 
powered by 3 MITEE engines. At GEO, the habitat vehicle 
is mated with a cycler vehicle (Stage 2) which travels back 
and forth between GEO and Mars orbit. The cycler vehicle 
is refueled from the GEO depot, using H, propellant which 
has been transported there from Mars orbit by a cargo 
propellant vessel. The cycler vehicle then propels the 
habitat towards Mars, with a 105 day trip time (Stage 3). 
Upon reaching Mars, the habitat and cycler separate. The 
habitat aerobrakes and makes a 2 km/sec controlled burn for 
land at the colony site (Stage 4), while the cycler does a 4 
km/sec bum for orbit capture (Stage 5) and rendezvous with 
the Martian fueling depot (Stage 6). The cycler remains at 
the depot until a returning habitat lifts off (Stage 7 in 
Figure 12B) from the colony site and reaches the depot. 
(The habitat only uses H,/02 engines, not nuclear engines, 
so there are no nuclear safety or environmental concerns). 
There it mates with the cycler (Stage 8) which is refueled

with H, propellant lifted up from Mars. The cycler then 
propels the habitat towards Earth, with a 120 day trip time 
(Stage 9). Upon reaching Earth, the habitat separates, to 
aerobmke and land on Earth (Stage 10) while the cycler 
undergoes a 3.7 M s e c  bum (Stage 11) for GEO insertion. 
(The habitat also does a 2 W s e c  bum to decrease the re- 
entry velocity to I 1  ladsec [Apollo type re-entry] for 
landing.) 
Figure 13 illustrates the propellant transport position of the 
Earth-Mars-Earth architecture. A fueling shuttle vehicle is 
used to transport liquid 5 from the Mars colony up to the 
fueling depot at Mars orbit (Stages 1 and 2). A portion of 
this liquid H, is used to fuel the cycler for its return with the 
attached habitat to Earth. The remainder is loaded (Stage 3) 
into the NTCPV (Nuclear Thermal Cargo Propellant Vehicle) 
which transports liquid H, back to the GEO fuel depot 
(Stages 4, 5 ,  and 6). The NTCPV then returns to the Mars 
depot, using its remaining liquid H, for the trip (Stage 7 ) .  
Table 4 summarizes the propellant flow requirements for a 
steady state architecture serving a mature Mars colony of 
500 persons. The colonists turnover rate is assumed to be 
20% every 2 years, i.e., 100 persons go to  Mars, requiring 5 
habitat trips, and 100 persons return, also requiring 5 habitat 
trips. The propellant fuel requirements include: 
1) the the liquid H, transported back to the GEO depot to 
fuel the cyclerhabitat vehicles for their outbound trips to 
Mars; 2) the liquid H, consumed by the NTCPV vehicles in

the H, used by the  H,/O, engines in the habitat vehicles as 
they liR off from the colony site into Mars orbit; and 5) the 
H, used by the HJO, engines on the fueling shuttles to 
deliver liquid H2 payloads to the Mars depot. 
The total liquid H, production rate of 835 tons per year 
would require 20 megawatts (thermal) of reactor capacity at 
the Mars colony site, assuming a power conversion 
efficiency of 20%, thermal to electric and an operating factor 
of 90%. This amount of reactor capacity is easily provided. 
The oxygen production requires no additional power, since 
it autornatically comes along with the H, production. 
Other Earth-Mars-Earth architectures are possible and may 
offer even more attractive performance. An alternate 
architecture based on having the Earth fueling depot located 
in LEO was investigated. This option was not as attractive 
as the GEO option, however, because of the greater AV 
requirements for transport to and from Mars, and the 
requirement to  operate nuclear engines for orbit insertion at 
low orbital altitudes. The GEO depot location eliminates this 
requirement. 
Figure 14 shows the launch mass to Earth orbit per colonist 
traveling to Mars as a function of launch year. The value 
depends slightly on launch year, with an average of 8.6 
tons/ colonist trip. This is a factor of approximately 
10 smaller than the launch mass needed for astronauts 
exploring Mars using the individual mission approach, in 
1 - 2 2 8  
which most of the supplies and propellants for the mission would have to be launched from Earth.

7. XANADU - LIFE IN A MATURE MARTIAN COLONY 
Virtually all of the life support requirements for the colony 
can be met by ALPH. As shown in Figure 15, the colonists 
will be able to live very comfortably ample Earth type air (1 
atm, 20% 0,) and water, and living quarters at least as 
spacious as those for the average American. Moreover, 
ALPH provides ample power and space heat, so that the 
living and work quarters will be well lit and comfortably 
heated. The one contained area is large surface parks in the 
open sunlight. Substantial size parks, gardens and lakes 
could operate below the surface of the ice cap, but they 
would have to be artificially lit. Visits to a hansparent 
domed enclosed area on the surface would be possible, but 
outside visits would require a spacesuit. 
The colonists would seek to discover as much as they could 
about Mars. Figure 16 shows 3 modes for exploring Mars. 
First, the North Polar region could be explored by manned 
land rovers for distances of -1000 kilometers from the 
colony site. The rovers could be fabricated from plastics 
and metals produced by the colony, and fueled by 
methane/oxygen. Figure 17 outlines the features of the 
manned ice cap rovers. Traveling over frozen ice and 
permafrost surfaces, at a maximum speed of 50 kmhour 
(30 mph) they could traverse 2000 km in 70 hours of driving 
time or about 5 hours daily.The crew would measure local 
conditions at promising locations, collect samples for return 
to the colony, and emplace instruments 
monitor and record data on pressure and temperature, wind 
speed, dust content, seismic activity, etc. They could also 
emplace MICE units to travel inside the ice cap to 
investigate its internal structure, composition, etc. 
The second mode of exploration would use unmanned flyers 
to explore regions beyond the range of the land rovers. As 
illustrated in Figure 16, the flyers could touch down multiple 
locations, nominally on the order of 1000 kilometers apart, to 
take measurements and visual records, and to collect 
samples for return to the colony. The flyers would be 
powered by a compact, ultra lightweight nuclear reactor, and 
use atmospheric CO, for propellant, with virtually unlimited 
mge.  The flyers could visit any location on Mars, even the 
South Pole. 
Using stored outboard liquid CO, propellant, the flyers 
would land and take off vertically at slow speed, i.e., like a 
VTOL, Harrier type jet. After takeoff, they would accelerate 
to supersonic M = 2 flight (470 meterdsec on Mars), using 
CO, from the Martian atmosphere as the propellant. The 
CO, would be directly absorbed in a molecular sieve type of 
material (e.g., activated carbon or zeolite) and periodically 
desorbed using hot gas from the reactor heat source. This 
temperature swing absorption (TSA) cycle would effectively 
compress the ram intake CO, up to the -10 atmospheres 
pressure level, where it would then pass through the reactor 
to be heated to an outlet temperature of -2000 K. 
The flyer thermal power is approximately 1 megawatt, a 
modest level readily delivered by a compact gas cooled 
reactor. The diameter of the ram inlet to collect the CO, 
propellant is only 25 centimeters. The unmanned flyer 
would not land and take off from the colony site but rather 
at a site several kilometers distant, to allow the remote 
retrieval of samples and maintenance efforts. Residual 
radioactivity on the reactor would not pose any danger or 
problems for the colony. The stored liquid CO, inventory 
on the flyer would be replenished at each touchdown point, 
using an on-board compressor and liquefier to capture 
atmosphere CO,. Replenishment, which would take a few 
hours, enables the flyer to vertically take off and land at its 
next destination. 
The third exploration mode, illustrated in Figure 16 is 
mannecl flyers. Use of a nuclear propulsion engine for 
mannecl flight poses risks, and is not necessary. Instead, 
the manned flyers would cany liquid methane/oxygen fuel 
to heat atmospheric CO, for propulsion. Given the low 
density of the Martian atmosphere and the consequent 
inefficiencies of flight, it is not possible to fly for long 
distances with a single load of methane/oxygen fuel. Rather, 
periodic depots of methane/oxygen fuel would be 
established by the unmanned flyers. The manned flyers 
would fly from depot to depot refueling with 
methandoxygen at each stop. The depots would be laid out 
so that each represented a promising site for scientific 
exploration, allowing both the refueling and exploration 
process to be carried out at the same time. The nominal 
distance between depots would be about 1000 kilometers. 
With sufficient depots, manned flyers could travel all the 
way to the South Pole, if desired 
The exploration program appears well within the capabilities 
of a 500 person colony and would not be constrained by 
lack of propellants and supplies. It would yield an 
enormcus amount of new and exciting knowledge about 
Martian climatology, geology, meteorology, hydrology, 
seismollogy, and hopefully, even paleontology. 
Table 5 summarizes production rates for the principal 
supplies and material needed for life support, exploration, 
and Earth-Mars-Earth transport in a 500 person Mars 
colony. The amount shown are generous; however, they 
could be considerably greater, if desired. The total reactor 
power required is modest, even for a 500 person colony. Six 
small 1.0 MW(th) reactors would supply more than enough 
electric power, space heat and air and water for the colony, 
plus all the materials and supplies required, plus a rapidly 
growing stockpile of food, propellants, oxygen, fuels, etc. 
that by itself could sustain the colony for years. Hydrogen 
production from water electrolysis is extremely well 
deve1o:ped. No surprises or problems are anticipated in 
producing hydrogen, oxygen, water and air for the colony.

The electric power generation technology is very well 
developed and available right now. The steam cycle 
efficiency of 20% is extremely conservative; Earth based 
power plants routinely achieve much higher efficiencies. 
Most (80%) of the oxygen produced is discarded, even after 
stockpile additions equal to 50% of the consumption rate are 
added. The air losses, which have already been over 
estimated, could be increased 100 fold without requiring 
additional oxygen generation. To support a substantial 
colony, a very large amount of water, tens of thousands of 
tons per year, is required, both for life support and for 
materials production. This amount of accessible water or 
sub-surface ice will probably not be available at any location 
other than the North Polar Cap. The Polar Cap is the logical 
site for a colony. Nuclear power is a necessity if humanity 
is to have a substantial colony on Mars. Solar simply 
cannot supply the power and heat required given the 
difficulty of construction, the problems of dust, and the 
reduced solar flux. 
Finally, any significant Mars colony must be self supporting 
with only a small fraction of its needs supplied from Earth. 
In addition to supporting itself, it must minimize the 
remaining transport requirements from Earth by supplying 
the propellants and supplies needed for trips to and from 
Mars. 
8. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
A new approach for the exploration of Mars is described. It 
would establish a permanent colony on Mars North Polar 
Cap, where unlimited amounts of water in the form of an 
extensive, thick ice sheet are readily accessible. A compact 
robotic factory unit, termed ALPH, would land on the ice 
sheet at the colony site 2 years before the first group of 
colonists arrived. Using a small, ultra lightweight nuclear 
reactor to supply heat and electric power, ALPH would 
manufacture and stockpile hundreds of tons of propellants 
and supplies that would be ready for use when the colonists 
arrived. In addition, ALPH would also create large, 
insulated habitats under the ice surface, in which the 
colonists would be hlly shielded from cosmic radiation. 
Ample amounts of all of the materials - propellants, fuels, air, 
water, plastics, and food - required for a large permanent 
colony would be produced by ALPH, using ice together 
with CO, and N, from the Martian atmosphere as raw feed 
materials. In addition to producing all of the supplies 
needed by the colony for life support and a vigorous Mars 
exploration program, ALPH would also produce linge 
amounts of liquid I-$ and O,, enabling an Earth-Mars-Earth 
transport architecture that would not require lifting 
propellants from Earth. Orbital fueling depots at Mars and 
Earth GEO would be supplied with propellants and supplies 
lifted from the Mars colony. The only Earth based launch 
requirements that remain are to lift Mars bound colonists up 
to GEO orbit. Propellants and supplies for trips from GEO to 
Mars and return to Earth would come from Mars, taking 
advantage of the lower AV requirements. 
A strong technology base already exists for the ALPH 
reactor and process units, as well as the nuclear thermal 
propulsion engines that would be used for the Earth-Mars- 
Earth architecture. The ALPH and MITEE propulsion 
systems can be demonstrated and ready for application 
within the time frame presently being considered for the 
initial manned missions to Mars. Based on a first manned 
landing in 2018, ALPH would have produced and stockpiled 
hundreds of tons of propellants and supplies at the North 
Polar landing site. 
Following the first landing, the colony could rapidly build 
up to a mature population of -500 persons by 2034 AD. 
Assuming an average turnover rate equivalent to 20% of the 
colony population returning to Earth every 2 years, the 
corresponding Earth launch requirements to sustain the 
colony would be only 5 habitat vehicle launches to GEO 
every 2 years, with each habitat weighing -100 tons and 
carrying 20 persons. 
In conclusion, the self-supporting Mars colony exploration 
approach has major advantages over the conventional 
individual mission approach. These include: 
9 Much lower risk, for both the astronauts and the 
Much greater Mars exploration capability 
mission 
Greatly reduced Earth launch requirements 
Much better living conditions on Mars 
Ability to use Mars as a base for exploration of the outer 
solar system. 
Based on these advantages, further investigation of the 
Mars colony approach appears desirable, including 
Research and Development on the key technology elements.
