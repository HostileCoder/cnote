Abstract- Blade tip sensors embedded into the engine case 
have been used for decades to measure blade tip clearance 
and blade vibration. Many sensing technologies have been 
used; capacitive, inductive, optical, microwave, infra-red, 
eddy-current, pressure and acoustic. These sensors generate 
data streams far greater than have been historically used in 
engine diagnostic units. Data streams of about 10,000 
samples per second per sensor are about the minimum 
achievable, with some sensor front-ends delivering data 
streams of greater than lMegasamples per second per 
sensor. In a PHM application, this data cannot be stored for 
later human analysis, but must be analyzed and discarded. 
This paper outlines autonomous algorithms for the real-time 
analysis of this data stream for PHM purposes. The 
application of these algorithms to several seeded fault tests 
is described. The need for a series of additional seeded fault 
tests is highlighted, for the purpose of maturing these 
algorithms prior to introduction into service.

1. INTRODUCTION 
For decades, non-contacting blade tip sensors have been 
used to measure blade clearance and blade time of arrival of 
rotating machinery. Non-contacting sensors come in many 
varieties including capacitive, inductive, optical, eddy 
current, infra-red, etc.. . 
The analog sensor signals are dealt with in a number of 
ways. Some systems digitize the raw sensor signal upwards 
of 1MHz. Other systems extract only blade time of arrival 
information, which creates a data stream of 10,000 samples 
per second (for 10,000RPM and 60 blades) per sensor. 
Hood Technology’s system generates two numbers per 
blade: time of arrival and tip clearance. This doubles the 
data rate. 
PHM applications under consideration are high cycle fatigue 
(HCF), FOD, and rotor burst anticipation. Hood 
Technology Corporation has participated in a number of 
seeded fault engine and spin pit tests and developed an 
outline for prognostic and diagnostic algorithms to be used 
in a comprehensive engine diagnostic unit (C-EDU). 
This paper addresses several PHM functions. The theory 
behind detection, Hood Tech’s experience, and proposed 
algorithms are presented. These functions are:

2. FOD DETECTION 
The0 y 
Under normal operating conditions, a blade arrives with the 
same circumferential arrival (relative to a shaft reference or 
to the other blades) each revolution. If a blade is hit by an 
object, two things may happen. First, the blade may vibrate, 
which will be seen as transient change in the circumferential 
arrival relative to a shaft reference. Second, the blade could 
be plastically deformed, such that there is a permanent 
change in circumferential arrival. 
To simplify detection, reliance on the shaft reference can be 
eliminated by observing the inter-blade angle (IBA). The 
primary goal is to detect which blade the FOD affected. 
Additionally, an estimate of severity is desired.

Maintenance intervals are typically based on engine 
operating time. It may be possible to safely increase 
maintenance intervals by counting vibratory stress cycles 
rather than just engine operating time. In order to do this, 
the dynamics of the rotor must be understood in order to 
correlate blade tip deflection to stress.

When it is possible to quanti& a resonant vibration 
amplitude (i.e. during an RPM sweep), the resonant RPM 
and tip deflection is determined using a curve fit of the time 
of arrival data. From prior knowledge, the maximum blade 
stress associated with this tip deflection for this mode is 
determined. When the engine operates near this speed, the 
processor counts stress cycles. Additionally, should a blade

be hit by FOD, subsequent stress cycles are weighted more 
heavily. 
Experience 
The key to cumulative fatigue counting is to identify blade 
resonances and determine the blade tip deflection 
amplitudes. Additionally, one must be able to detect FOD, 
which is covered in the preceding section. 
Hood Tech has had a number of opportunities to identify 
blade resonances and their amplitudes. One example is a 
19" diameter compressor stage at the Compressor Aero 
Research Laboratory (CARL) facility at Wright-Patterson 
Air Force Base. Data from 4 capacitive sensors was used to 
extract blade resonance characteristics, shown in Figure 4. 
Algorithm 
Figure 5 shows a diagram of the stress cycle counting 
algorithm to predict cumulative fatigue. The blade 
resonances are identified, and operating speeds are weighted 
depending on vibrational amplitudes. The stress cycles are 
penalized more if the blade has been impacted by FOD. 
4. CRACK GROWTH MONITORING 
Theoiy 
It is believed that a blade crack will be detectable by 
observing a shift in a resonance of that blade. Figure 6 
shows a prediction, based on finite element analysis, of a 
shift in the 2"d torsion mode of a F100-PW-100 fan blade. If 
one can accurately identify a blade resonance, one should be 
able to diagnose the existence and growth of a crack.

is to perform a curve fit, and extract resonance parameters. 
More simply, one can calculate the cross-correlation factor 
between the current response and a reference case and find 
for what RPM shift it is maximized. This shift is indicative 
of the shift in resonance.

Figure 7 shows the maximum correlation coefficients 
between the two runs. Unfortunately, data was not measured 
at an RPM low enough to identify the shifted resonances. 
However, the modified blades are easily identified because 
of low maxi" correlation coefficients. This method is 
yet to be proven on actual crack growth. 
Algorithm 
Figure 8 shows a diagram of a proposed algorithm for crack 
detection. When the operating speed passes through the 
expected RPM range, the data is smoothed and compared to 
a baseline case, using correlation coeficients or parameter 
extraction. The detection filter contains a threshold. Any 
shift greater than the threshold will be reported to a higher 
level in the C-EDU. 
5 .  TIP CLEARANCE 
Theory 
Monitoring tip clearance is a useful diagnostic tool. It 
allows one to observe rotor unbalance (integral run-out) and 
whirl (non-integral run-out). It also helps prevent blade rub. 
With many of the aforementioned non-contacting blade tip 
sensors, the analog signal amplitude is a function of blade 
clearance. 
Tip clearance information is also used for evaluating disk 
integrity, which is covered in the next section. 
Algorithm 
Figure 9 shows the proposed algorithm to extract run-out 
information in the C-EDU. The tip clearance data is 
processed to extract the integral run-out (unbalance) and 
non-integral run-out (whirl). These values, continuously 
updated, are monitored against a threshold. 
6. DISK INTEGRITY 
Theory 
One potential failure mode of a rotor is a disk burst. This is 
typically due to cracks starting near where the blades meet 
the hub. One would thus expect a softening of this 
attachment point before failure. The softening of the 
mechanical link would result in a greater blade stretch under 
centrifugal loads. Figure 10 shows a blade length signature 
that could be indicative of hub failure. 
Additionally, the change in blade length would change the 
unbalance of the rotor. Therefore, the rotor unbalance is 
monitored, as in the previous section, because it may be a 
precursor to rotor burst as well. 
When the signal amplitude is converted into blade clearance 
information, an LMS fit can be used to determine the l/rev 
component, which is a measure of rotor unbalance.

iigure 10- This figure demonstrates how blade length may be indicative of a hub crack. At high speeds, the blades 
lengthen due to centripetal stretch. There will also be a thermal transient. When the hub begins to fail, the amount 
by which the blade stretches should increase. 
Figure 11- Raw blade clearance data is processed to yield a measure of unusual blade elongation. Data processing 
includes removing lhev component of run-out (unbalance), thermal transients, and nominal blade length. 
Experience 
Hood Technology has gathered non-contacting blade tip 
sensor data fiom a low cycle fatigue spin test. Figure 11 
shows raw blade clearance fiom this test. Unbalance, 
thermal transients, and nominal blade length are removed 
from the data to yield a measure of unusual blade 
elongation. The figure shows that the processed data has a 
variability of only a few mils. We have yet to determine 
whether a precursor signal is present with this type of 
monitoring, as the test was not run to destruction. 
by an amount greater than a specified threshold, then the 
information will be reported to a higher level of the C-EDU. 
7. CONCLUSIONS 
Algorithm development and operational experience have 
brought us closer to the eventual goal of developing an 
autonomous PHM system for non-contacting blade tip 
sensors. Table 1 summarizes current capabilities and areas 
in which improvement it needed.
