Absfracf - In this paper;we deal with the broadband 
constant heamwidth beamforming problem for circular arrays. 
The response vector of a circular array is expanded in the form 
of sum of an infinite series, whose core function is the first kind 
Bessel function. High order terms of this series are truncated so 
that the array response vectors at different frequency 
components can he transformed to be approximately equal to 
that at the reference frequency. Constant heamwidth 
heamforming vectors can he constructed by using the 
transforming procedure, so that beams at different frequencies 
are same as the reference beam. The effectiveness ' of this 
method is firstly verified by computer simulation. To further 
investigate the performance of the proposed method, lake- 
experiment was carried out for a 24-element uniform circular 
array with radius = 1.5 m. Based on the data collected from the 
experiment, constant heamwidth beams were successfully 
formed at eight different frequencies covering one-octave 
frequency band. Although big amplitude difference among 
hydrophones was observed during the experiment, the constant 
heamwidth beams were still correctly formed except for some 
distortions at sidelobe region of the heampattern. From the 
experiment result, we can conclude that constant heamwidth 
heamforming approach proposed for circular array is 
applicable to practical systems and has good error tolerance. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Broadband signals are often encountered in both active 
sonar systems and passive sonar systems [I]. An active sonar 
system often uses broadband signals to improve the range 
resolution without reducing the velocity resolution, and a 
passive sonar system will take advantage of the broadband 
spectrum of noise radiated from targets of interest to detect 
their existence. In these systems, heamforming is used to 
discriminate between signals based on the physical locations 
of the signal sources [2]. The conventional broadband sonar 
system uses delay-weight-and-sum method to realize the 
beamforming procedure [I]. In such a system, the pattems of 
spatial filters at different frequencies are different, which 
results in the different frequency responses in spatial domain 
except for the looking direction. When the target signals 
incident from directions other than the looking direction, 
linear distortion is unavoidable. Distortion in the received 
signal will degrade the performance of detection and 
estimation as well as that of classification of targets. The 
basic approach to solve this problem is using constant 
beamwidth heamformers, where the array system has the 
same spatial frequency responses for different frequency 
components of broadband signal [3-81. Most of the existing 
approaches of designing constant heamwidth beamformers 
are for linear arrays. The main ideas behind these approaches 
are either to change the sensor number of the array, or to 
change the effective c a y  aperture. Unforhkately, very few 
of the existing approaches are suitable for circular array. 
In this paper, we will deal with the broadband constant 
beamwidth beamforming problem for circular arrays. The 
response vector of a circular array is expanded in the form of 
sum of an infinite series, whose core function is the first kind 
Bessel function. The high order terms of this series are 
truncated so that the array response vectors can he partitioned 
into two parts. In the two parts, one is always the same 
regardless of frequencies and the other is changing with 
frequency. We can use the changing part to transform the 
array response vectors at different frequencies to be equal to 
that at reference frequency. From the transforming procedure, 
the constant beamwidth beamforming vectors can be formed, 
so that the beams at different frequencies are the same as the 
reference beam. 
The effectiveness of this method is verified by computer 
simulation. To further investigate the performance of the 
proposed method, lake-experiment was,carried out for a 24- 
element uniform circular array with radius = 1.5 m. Based on 
the data collected from the experiment, constant beamwidth 
beams were successfully formed at eight different frequencies 
covered one-octave frequency band. During the experiment, 
big amplitude difference among hydrophones was observed, 
hut the constant beamwidth beams were still correctly formed 
except for some distortions at sidelobe regions of the 
beampattems. From the experiment result, we can conclude 
that constant beamwidth beamforming approach proposed in 
this paper for circular array is applicable to practical systems 
and has good error tolerance. 
11. PROBLEM FORMULATION 
Consider an uniform circular plane array with M 
omnidirectional elements receiving plane wavefronts radiated 
from point sources in the far-field of the array, as shown in 
Fig. I .  Assume that the elements of the array have the same 
amplitude and phase responses. The position vector of the 
mth element is 
rm = (rc cosOm,rc sin 0, ,0) , m = 1; .., M (2.1) 
0-933957-30-0 1647 
where Om = ZmnlM,  rr is the radius of the circular array. If 
the plane wavefront incidents from -e direction to the array, 
where 
(2.4 e = (sin(cos 8, sin (sin $,cos () 
. . then the time delay between the signals received at the mth 
element and the reference point (origin of circular akray) is 
= -e. r, I C  = -rc sin &os(B, - B ) / c  (2 .3)  
where c is the sound propagation velocity. If  the signal 
received at the reference point is s( t )  Othen the output of the 
mth element of the array is 
xm(t )  = s(r - rm)+ n,( t )  (2.4) 
where s( t )  is a broadband signal with frequency band 
f € [ f L , f U ] ,  nm(t) is the additive noise on the mth element. 
Taking Fourier transform of (2.4), we have 
X m ( f )  = e-"?S(f)+ " ( f ) '  (2.5) 
The frequency domain output ofarray denoted in matrix form 
is given by 
(2.6) X U )  = A ( f > ~ 4 w ( f )  + N ( f )  
where X ( f ) = [ X , ( f )  ... Xu(/)] is the received array 
signal vector, N ( f ) = [ N , ( f )  ... A',(/)] the additive 
noise vector, A ( / ,  B,() the response vector of circular array, 
= [ e , ~ ~ ~ r i n + c o ~ ~ , - o ~ i r  ei i# , iro#cm(a.mir T 1 (2.7) ... , ,  
Without loss of generality, now we only consider the case 
where the incident signal is in the same plane as the circular 
array, i.e., ( = x 1 2 ,  In this case, the array response vector is 
(2.8)

The heamformer output is formed by applying a weight 
Y .  = W,"Wf;) (2.9) 
where " H  denotes Hermitian transpose, and w, is the M- 
vector of array weights to apply to the ith frequency bin. The 
spatial response of the beamformer is given by 
B(f;,6') = w,"A(f;,@) (2.10) 
which defines the transfer relation between a source at 
location B E [ - - I T , ~ )  and the beamformer output. The 
problem of designing constant beamwidth beamformer can 
now be formulated as finding the-array weights in each 
frequency bin such that the resulting spatial response remains 
constant' over all frequency bins of interest.

111. THEORETICAL SOLUTION 
The conventional aipproach of .beamforming is to 
compensate the time delay between elements so that the 
received signals can be added with the same phase. 
Generally, amplitude weighting is applied to control the beam 
shapes. For a circular array, the weighting coefficients for 
the frequency bin f, making the beam steered to direction 
8, is 
wo. = diag(:w)A(f,,4) (3.1) 
where w = [ w '  ... w"] is the M-vector of amplitude 
weighting, diag(w) means a diagonal matrix whose diagonal 
elements are the elements of w .  The beampattem of the 
array at frequency bin f, is 
B(f , ,B)  =I w,HA(f,,@ l 2  (3.2) 
If the incident signal covers the fiequency band f E [f, ,/,I , 
the beampatterns at different frequency bins are obviously 
different. In this case, the beam output signal will be linearly 
distorted except for the signal comes from the looking 
direction. The essent:ial role of constant beamwidth 
beamforming is to select the weighting vectors at each 
frequency bin in the freqwncy band of interest so that 
B(f;,Q,) =I w,"A~:f;,@ /*E B(f,,@,) ' (3.3) 
For circular arrays, we can use the decomposition formula 
. . 
of plane waves, 
so that each element of the response vector of a circular array 
can be represented as the summation form of an infinite series, 
whose core function is the first kind Bessel function, 
1648 
. .  
where m = 1, "., M . Hence, the array response vector can be 
partitioned into two parts 
4f  = p ( f  )it(@) (3.6) 
where 
[ F ( f ) ] , .  = (j)"~"(2@? /c)e'"@- , m = I;.., M , (3.7) 
[Z(O)]- = e-'"o (3.8) 
According to (3.59, n =0,+1,+2,...&a, in (3.7) and (3.8). 
For the Bessel function J o ( z )  , z =  2@*/c , we now 
consider its plots in Fig. 2. We see that for high order Bessel 
functions, we will have max 1 J", ( z )  I< E in a certain interval, 
where E is a small value selected according to the accuracy 
requirement. Actually, the interval of z = 2& / c  in (3.7) is 
determined by the frequency band. For circular arrays, 
z E lzmin,zMxl = 1 2 ~ ~ _ , r , ~ c 3 2 r g F _ _ r ~ ~ c l  (3.9) 
For certain z- = 2@,rr I C   we can fmd an n, to satisfy 
I J ,  ( z )  /i E for all z in (3.9). With this observation, we can 
truncate T"( f )  and Z(8) at 1 n I= n, , so that 
40,f) T(f )w(Q)  (3.10) 
where T ( f )  is an Mx(2ns+l) ma&, ;(e) is a 
(2ns+1)x1 vector, which is frequency invariant. The 
beamforming vector of frequency bin f; can be designed 
using the invariance of w(O) , 
w, = T H  wo (3.11) 
where T = T(f"(f;)=T(f , ) l~H(f;)~(f;) l~'Ti'(f ; ) .  Now 
the beampattem of frequency bin f; is 
5(f;,@,) =I wX4f ; .@12  
1 w r T ( f , ) t T " ( f ; ) T ( f ; ) I ~ ' T " ( f ) T ( f ) ~ ( B )  1' (3.12) 
=I w:'T(f,)w(@) I'"l w:'A(f,,@) 1' 
which satisfies the constant beamwidth beamforming 
condition in (3.3). 
IV. COMPUTER SIMULATION 
A 24-element uniform circular array with radius r< = 1.5m 
was considered in computer simulation. The design was for a 
frequency band of 960-1920 Hz. In this case, Z",~.  in (3.9) 
was equal to 2 n f ~ ~  / c  = 12.06 , and we chose n6 = 1 5 .  The 
reference frequency is chosen as f ,  = 1600 Hz. We designed 
the beampattem at this reference frequency, as is shown in 
Fig. 3. The frequency band was divided into 16 frequency 
bins, each with center frequency f. =960+ 64n Hz 
( n = O,I, ' '  ,I5 ). The beamforming vector for each frequency 
bin was designed using (3.11). With these beamforming 
vectors, constant beamwidth beampattems were formed at 
each frequency, which is shown in Fig. 4. The -3 dB 
beamwidth of the beams in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 is 17.6".

V. LAKEEXF'ERIMENT hand, we obtained the array manifold (a set of array response 
vectors for different directions) of this experimental circular 
array by the method described in Appendix. Based on the 
real array manifold, beams can be formed. Fig. 6 showed the 
beams at the 8 selected frequencies. The conventional beams 
of the same circular array at each frequency.were also shown 
in Fig. 6. The -3 dB beamwidth of the beams was calculated, 
and shown in Table 2, where CBBW denotes the beamwidth 
of constant beamwidth beams, and CBW denotes the 
beamwidth of conventional beams. From Table 2, we can see 
that the difference of -3 dB beamwidth of the conventional 
beams between the highest' frequency and the lowest 
frequency is 10.3", whcreas. it is only 2.6" for constant 
beamwidth beams. Theoretically, the constant beamwidth 
beams will have tbe same -3dB beamwidth at each frequency 
bin. The experimental results deviated from the theoretical 
results because system  errors unavoidably existed in the 
circular array used in exptriment.

. We have made some efforts to guarantee the quality of the 
hydrophones used in the experiment array. The sensitivity of 
the hydrophones was measured using a standard hydrophone 
with known sensitivity as reference. Good results were 
obtained. For example, the sensitivity of 24 hydrophones at 
960 Hz was between -200 dB and -199 dE!, and each can be 
considered to be omnidirectional due to low spatial variation

in the spatial responses of individual hydrophone. When all 
the 24 hydrophones were installed on the circular array, the 
situation changed because of influence of the shuctule of 
circular array. Now difference o f  amplitude and phase 
responses among hydrophones will be greater than that 
measured individually. Fig 7. shows the amplitude responses 
of the 5th and the 22nd elements at 1024 Hz. We can see that 
the largest difference at some directions could be 
20log(l/0.7)=3 dB, much bigger than 1 dB. Fig. 7 also 
shows that the amplitude response with respect tdthe azimuth 
angle changed slowly, and the fluctuation was also bigger 
than 1 dB. 
Though there were big system errors in the circular array, 
the constant beamwidth beams were still correctly, formed 
except for some distortions at sidelobe regions of the 
beampattems.(Fig.6). The conclusion can be made that the 
constant heamwidth beamforming approach used in this 
paper for circular array has good error tolerance.

VI. CONCLUSIONS 
Circular array is widely used in broadband sonar systems. 
We have presented the rheoretical and experimental results 
for a broadband circular 'may in which the beamwidth of the 
far-field beam pattem is constant over a desired frequency 
range. It is expected that the detection and estimation ability 
of such a broadband sonar system will be improved by 
exploiting constant beamwidth beamforming. 
The heamforming vectors obtained in this' paper are 
suitable for frequency domain beamforming. There are 
several references [II-131 deal with the broadband 
beamforming in time domain. Those methods can he used to 
implement constant beamwidth beamforming in time domain.

APPENDIX: MEAWRING ARRAY MANIFOLD 
In order to measure the &ay response vector of the 
circular array at frequency J the received testing signal of 
each element can be transformed using the procedure in Fig. 
8. Assume that the received signal of the element after A/D 
converter is 
x(n) = A cos(27qin + p) (A.]) 
where f=f, i f ,  is the digital frequency of the signal, f ,  
the sampling frequency, 12 the index of sample points. x(n)  
is multiplied by a complex exponential signal with the same 
frequency to get y ( n )  as, 
1652

y ( i )  = x(n)exp(-j2*) 
= OSA{exp~(2@ + e)]+ exp[- j(2@ + p)lexp(- j2@) 
, . , = OSAexp(jp)+OSA ex& j (4dn  +a)] 
( A 4  
Then y(n) is summed kom n=O to N to get the fmal output z, 
. , , z =0.5Aexp(jq)+-exp(-jp)~eexp(- j4@) (A.3) 
The second term in the right hand of (A.3) is summation of a 
geometric progression. After simple calculation, we get ~

2N n.0 
z =  OSAexp(jp)+ 
Asin(2mVf) exp{- j [ 2 z ( ~ -  1)f + p] (A.4) . .  2 N  sin(2d) 
The second term in the right hand of (A.4) will be zero if 
N = m/2 f ( m = 1,2,. . . ). In this case, (A.4) is simplified to 
z = OSAexp(jp) (-4.5) 
Hence the amplitude and initial phase of the received signal is 
obtained, which represents the amplitude and phase response 
of this sensor to the signal &om a certain direction. If m/Z f 
is not an integer, then N can be selected as an integer nearest 
m/2 f , which guarantees (AS) he satisfied approximately. 
When the received signal at each element is processed 
using the above approach, the array response vector for a 
’. certain direction is obtained. Varying the direction of the 
‘.incident testing signal, we can form the array manifold of the 
circular array.
