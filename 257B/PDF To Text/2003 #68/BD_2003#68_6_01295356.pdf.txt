Abstract—This paper described a method for producing of the 
precise global DMSP/OLS nighttime mosaic data using plural 
OLS scenes in short duration in 1997 and its integration with 
NOAA/AVHRR data. The analysis results of integrated data in 
1997 and the latter half of the 1980’s clearly showed the 
spreading of light distribution pattern in several big cities, and 
changes in the geographical distribution of the lights from forest 
fire and field fire.

I. INTRODUCTION
The Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) 
Operation Linescan System (OLS) data observing night light 
distribution on the earth’s surface have been archived since the 
1970’s. The main lights distribution on the earth detected by 
the OLS sensor are city lights, forest fire, burning of shifting 
cultivation, the flame of the gas combustion in oil fields and 
the fishing fire of boats due to human activities.  Authors have 
been analyzing night lights distribution on the earth shown in 
the DMSP/OLS images since the 1970's to investigate the 
economic tendency of the world, energy consumption 
situations and biomass burning conditions. A few global 
DMSP/OLS mosaic images had been created by using OLS 
images as the film base archives until the end of 1980’s[1].  
The production of OLS data sets with continental scale has 
been continued by some data centers or laboratories, because 
the archive and distribution of the digital data were started by 
NOAA/NGDC from the 1990's. However the archive and 
distribution of OLS global mosaic images aren't always being 
carried out steadily for the various reasons. 
In this study, a method for producing of the precise 
global DMSP/OLS nighttime mosaic data using plural OLS 
scenes in short duration was examined, and a global OLS 
nighttime mosaic data in 1997 was actually created based on 
the examined algorism. The completed global DMSP/OLS 
mosaic data was combined with the multi-temporal global 
NOAA/AVHRR GAC NDVI datasets and several scenes of 
the NOAA/AVHRR LAC data for the purpose of the 
comparison analysis of them. Finally, Authors refer to the 
characteristics of the night lights distribution and its change in 
the vegetation area through the comparative analysis between 
the OLS mosaic images of the latter half of the 1980's and 
1997.
II. PRODUCTION OF GLOBAL OLS MOSAIC DATA 
A. OLS Data in 1997 
The DMSP/OLS usually acquires observation data on the 
earth about visible and near infrared regions with spatial 
resolution of about 2.7km and   the scanning width of about 
3000km. The sensor has a capability to detect low levels of 
radiance energy at night.  About twenty-fifth scenes of the 
OLS in January (Northern Hemisphere), and August and 
September (Southern Hemisphere) in 1997 which are belong 
to the winter season respectively were selected for global 
mosaic image creation in this study, because  there are a few 
influences of the solar light and the moonlight.  
B. Method of global OLS mosaic image production 
A plate carree projection with about 4km spatial 
resolution on the equator was applied to the precise geometric 
correction in consideration of mosaicking operation and time 
series comparative analysis of the global data. The image of 
this projection is consisted of 10,000 pixels in the latitude 
direction and 5,000 lines in the longitude direction. The 
relationship between the coordinates of latitude and longitude, 
and the image coordinates of pixel and line is the followings. 
MP = NL/360 × (Ȝ - Ȝ0) + 5000      (1) 
ML = - NL/360 × ĳ + 2500         (2) 
Where:  MP:  pixel number on the plate carree projection 
      ML: line number on the plate carree projection 
      NL: pixel number of longitude direction (=10000) 
         Ȝ0   :  0° (central meridian) 
         Ȝ    : longitude coordinates 
         ĳ    : latitude coordinates 
      A production procedure of global OLS mosaic data is 
shown in Figure 1. 
Before the geometric correction process, the correction for 
un-uniformed spatial resolution of each pixel along the 
scanning direction of OLS was carried out because the IFOV 
of OLS changes irregularly to the scanning outside from nadir 
0-7803-7930-6/$17.00 (C) 2003 IEEE
0-7803-7929-2/03/$17.00 (C) 2003 IEEE 4044
by the special scanning system [2].  The correction of the pixel 
digital number (DN) was performed because the value was 
changed at 766km position from nadir along the scanning 
direction.

The precise geometric correction process consists of two 
stages such as systematic orientation referring the information 
of image pixel location on the earth and the precise orientation 
using sufficient ground control points (GCPs). The first 
geometric correction for each OLS scene was carried out by 
the estimation of image pixel location based on DMSP orbit 
data, and every scene was converted to a plate carree 
projection. Since several pixels errors were shown in each 
oriented image after the first correction, the second precise 
geometric correction using the GCPs was performed. About 
20 to 40 GCPs of cities were selected in each scene. This 
latitude and longitude coordinates were measured on 
1/1000000 scale maps. The cubic polynomial shown in the 
following was adapted to the first and second orientation 
respectively. The accuracy for the orientation of each scene 
was within 1.0 pixel and 1.0 line in standard deviation.

After the geometric correction, a global OLS nighttime 
mosaic data of 1997 was produced through the cloud removal 
operation and the nearest pixel selection to the nadir on 
referring to the far infrared channel data of OLS in the 
overlapping area between the adjoining orbits. A completed 
precise global DMSP/OLS mosaic image was composed of the 
data on January, 1997 in the Northern Hemisphere and August 
and September, 1997 in the Southern Hemisphere.  A global 
DMSP/OLS nighttime mosaic image in 1997 is shown in 
Figure 2. 
III. INTEGRATION GLOBAL DMSP/OLS DATA WITH 
NOAA DATA 
A.  Integrated data processing
The global DMSP/OLS mosaic nighttime data was 
combined with the compiled NDVI image derived from 
NOAA/AVHRR GAC NDVI data sets and NOAA/AVHRR 
LAC data for the purpose of analysis of the distribution and 
the changes in forest fire, wildfire and shifting cultivation.  
The global NDVI data for the integration with the Global 
OLS data were produced by selecting and compiling several 
scenes of NOAA/AVHRR GAC NDVI data sets in 1997, 
because the global DMSP/OLS mosaic data in 1997 consists 
of different seasonal data in the Northern Hemisphere and the 
Southern Hemisphere. The global color coded image from 
brown to green was generated corresponding to the increase in 
the NDVI value. After this process, an integrated DMSP/OLS 
image with the NDVI image as shown in Figure 3 was created. 
On the other hand, the composite images of OLS data 
with NOAA/AVHRR LAC data of the same observation date 
and season were created to perform the detailed investigation 
of the relationship between land cover condition and night 
lights distribution such as forest fires, wildfires and shifting 
cultivation in South America, Australia and Africa. Both 
spatial resolution of DMSP/OLS and NOAA/AVHRR were 
unified into 1km in objective areas through the precise 
geometric correction by using satellite orbit information and 
GCPs.  After that, the integration of DMSP/OLS and 
NOAA/AVHRR with 1km spatial resolution was carried out. 
B. Characteristics of Night Lights Distribution by 
Integreated Images of DMSP/OLS and NOAA/AVHRR 
The integrated process for an existing global DMSP/OLS 
mosaic data in the latter half of the 1980’s with the NDVI data 
was also carried out for the purpose of the comparative 
analysis of both images. Next, the characteristics of night 
lights distribution and their change in about 10 years from the 
1980’s to the 1990’s were investigated in detail through the 
comparison of two global mosaic data on the 1980’s with the 
1997 on referring to the geographical information data such as 
coastline, river and lake. The analysis results for night lights 
distribution and their changes are as the followings. 
  1) The influence due to the concentration of population and 
the economical growth in the cities of North America and 
Europe, and the metropolis of the developing counties was 
considered, because the spreading of the night lights 
distribution areas was clearly shown in these cities.
  2) The change in the night lights distribution of shifting 
cultivation in Africa showed increase and the distribution in 
India and South-East Asia showed decrease, so that the 
influences due to the population growth, seasonal variation 
and the change in life environment were presumed. 
  3) The enlargement of lights distribution area of forest fire to 
the inland region due to the progress of agricultural land 
development in the tropical forest was shown clearly in Brazil.

IV. SUMMARY 
The results of this study are summarized as follows. 
 1) A global DMSP/OLS mosaic data in 1997 was completely 
produced by a method consisting of the correction for un-
uniformed spatial resolution and DN variation of each pixel, 
the precise geometric correction on referring the orbit 
information and GCPs, and mosaicking operation of decrease in 
cloud and scan angle effects.
  2) It was shown that the investigation of the detailed night 
lights distribution by analyzing the integrated image of 
DMSP/OLS data with NOAA/AVHRR GAC NDVI data or 
NOAA/AVHRR LAC data was useful. 
  3) The characteristics of changes in night lights distribution 
based on the comparison of global DMSP/OLS images in 1997 
and the latter half of the 1980’s showed the spreading of the 
lights distribution of the cities in the advanced countries and 
the metropolis in the developing counties, the increase in lights 
from shifting cultivation of Africa and the enlargement of 
lights from forest fire toward the inland region in Brazil.
