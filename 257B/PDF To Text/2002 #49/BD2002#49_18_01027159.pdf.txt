  Abstract - The authors investigated on the 
applicability of interferometric SAR (InSAR) for 
monitoring forest fire damage. We attempted to use the 
coherence information obtained through interferometric 
SAR (InSAR) to detect and monitor damaged areas by 
forest fire. The test site is the forest around Tamano-City in 
Okayama Prefecture, where a relatively big forest fire 
occurred in August, 1994, and a total area of 359 ha was 
burnt. We used several interferometric data pairs by JERS-1 
SAR acquired before and after the forest fire. The multi-
look intensity images and the coherence images were 
created in the test site and both of intensity and coherence 
changes due to the fire in damaged forest areas were 
extracted and they were compared with those in non-
damaged forest areas. The result indicated that intensity 
decreased slightly after the fire, however, the change was 
not big enough to interpret and extract damaged forest areas 
clearly. On the other hand, coherence increased 
significantly in damaged areas after the fire and it was 
much easier to interpret and extract damaged areas 
compared with intensity. The experimental result in this 
study supports that InSAR is effective for detecting and 
monitoring land cover changes by a forest fire as well as 
deforestation, for which InSAR has been already verified to 
use effectively.  
 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
   Forest fire is a serious forest disaster bringing in the 
loss of forest biomass as well as deforestation in global 
environment. Space-borne SAR data are expected to use for 
monitoring damaged areas timely due to their all weather 
characteristics. However, previous case studies indicated 
that SAR images are difficult to interpret and detect 
damaged forest areas after a fire [1]. On the other hand, the 
coherence information obtained from interferometric SAR 
(InSAR) has been proved to be effectively used for detecting 
deforestation [2]. Therefore, it is expected that coherence 
also can be used for forest fire damage detection because 
both of deforestation and forest fire result in the loss of 
biomass. We attempted to use the coherence information 
obtained through InSAR to detect and monitor damaged 
areas by forest fire.  
II. STUDY AREA, DATA AND PROCESSING 
 
   The study area is forest areas around Tamano-City in 
Okayama Prefecture. On 11 August 1994, a big forest fire 
occurred in this area and a total area of 359 ha was burnt.     
We used several JERS-1 SAR interferometric data pairs 
before and after the forest fire as indicated in Table 1. All of 
the data pairs were acquired with one repeat cycle interval 
(44 days) in order to avoid land cover changes which might 
cause coherence degradation. The data pairs No.1 and 2 
were acquired before the forest fire and other pairs after the 
fire. 
   Vexcel 3dSAR Processor was used for SAR data 
processing. The coherence image was created through 
interferometric processing of two single-look complex 
(SLC) data from a data pair in which three range pixels and 
nine azimuth lines were averaged into one pixel of the 
coherence image. The multi-look intensity image with same 
pixel size as the coherence image was also created from one 
of the two data. Both of coherence and intensity images 
were overlaid onto the JERS-1 OPS image acquired after 
the fire, and then they are classified into damaged/non-
damaged forest areas by masking using extracted damaged 
areas by the OPS image.

III. RESULT OF DATA ANALYSIS 
 
A. Changes of Intensity Images by Forest Fire 
 
Fig.1 shows the intensity images before and after the 
fire and the subtracted image of above two images. In Fig.1, 
there are hardly seen the intensity differences of burnt areas 
(indicated by a circle) between two images before and after 
the fire. In the subtracted image, SAR backscattering 
intensity of burnt areas slightly decreases after the fire. 
However, this difference is very small and not enough for 
the extraction of total burnt areas by the fire. 
  The graph of Fig.3 shows the histograms of the 
differences of SAR backscattering coefficient values before 
and after the fire. In Fig.3, there are seen slight differences 
between burnt and non-burnt areas. The histogram for burnt 
areas slightly shifts to lower position, which indicates that 
SAR backscatter slightly decreases after the fire. The reason 
why SAR backscatter decreases might be the decrease of 
surface roughness due to the loss of tree leaves and 
branches by the fire.  
 
B. Changes of Coherence Images by Forest Fire 
 
Fig.2 shows the coherence images before and after the 
fire and their subtracted image. In Fig.2, the coherence of 
burnt areas after the fire clearly increases compared with 
that before the fire. In the subtracted image, the change of 
coherence is much more clear than that in the subtracted 
intensity image in Fig.1.  
Fig.4 shows the same graph as Fig.3 for coherence. 
Fig.4 indicates more clear separation between burnt and 
non-burnt areas than that in Fig.3. The histogram for burnt 
areas clearly shifts to higher position than that for non-
burnt areas. In Fig.4, the histogram for non-burnt areas 
shifts to higher position as well as that for burnt areas, 
which suggests instability of coherence information possibly 
due to the change of biological conditions of trees. However, 
the difference of the coherence distribution between burnt 
and non-burnt areas is much greater than that of the 
intensity distribution, and therefore, the coherence 
information is considered to be more distinctive parameter 
for detecting damaged areas by forest fire compared with 
the intensity information. 
 
C. Coherence Change Due to Vegetation Recovery  
 
    By the data pairs No.4 to No.6 in Table 1, the 
extracted coherence changes by the forest fire were less than 
those by the data pair No.3 which are presented in the 
previous section. The data pairs No.4 and No.5 are acquired 
in the summer season in 1995, when vegetation should 
recover rapidly because this period is the first summer 
season after the forest fire. In addition, the data pair No.6 is 
acquired one year and a half after the fire. Therefore, 
coherence might decrease according to the recovery of 
vegetation in the damaged forest areas, and as a result, 
coherence changes due to the fire might become less. This 
fact suggests that it is better to acquire interferometric data 
pairs as soon as possible after a forest fire in order to detect 
forest fire damages successfully.          
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
 
    Foregoing analyses verify that the coherence 
information obtained by interferometric SAR (InSAR) can 
be effectively used for detecting forest fire damages more 
than SAR backscatter intensity. In addition, it was 
suggested that the coherence might be affected by 
vegetation recovery of damaged forest areas, and therefore, 
interferometric data pairs should be acquired as soon as 
possible after a forest fire to detect damages successfully. 
This experimental study also supports the effectiveness of  
coherence information for monitoring land cover changes 
caused by various disaster events, such as volcanic 
eruption[3] and earthquake[4] as well as forest fire.
