Abstract-The general approach to ISAR imaging is range­
Doppler (RD) imaging approach. For this approach, the 
translational motion compensation (TMC) is fustly obtained 
by envelope alignment and autofocus, so the target can be 
treated as a rotating target for the next processing. But in 
this method, scatterers' migration through resolution cells 
(MTRC) caused by rotational motion is neglected. However 
in practice, MTRC exists with the improvement of 
resolution or for big target. For MTRC compensation, a 
keystone transfonnation in SAR is used in this paper. Before 
keystone transfonnation, it is demanded that the raw data is 
coherent, while in fact, the ISAR raw data is usually not. So 
a coherent processing of raw data is proposed. In this paper, 
the coherent processing of raw data is firstly done and the 
next step is to correct MTRC. Finally a parameter estimation 
method of multi-component amplitude modulation and 
linear frequency modulation (AM-LFM) signal is proposed 
to estimate the scatterers' instantaneous amplitudes and 
frequencies, and the Range-Instantaneous Doppler (RID) 
ISAR image is obtained. The effective of this algorithm is 
testified by the processing of simulation data.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Inverse synthetic aperture radar (lSAR) imaging has 
received intensive attention during the past twenty years [1-
32], due to its capability to produce high-resolution target 
images over long ranges, under all weather conditions, day 
and night. Fine range resolution is obtain by transmitting a 
signal that has a wide frequency bandwidth. Doppler 
frequecny resolution, and hence crossrange resolution, 
inversely proportional to the coherent integration time 
intervaUangle [1]. 
In ISAR, the relative motion needed to obtain the synthetic 
aperture is induced by the moving of target itself In general, 
the relative radar/target motion can be decomposed into 
translational motion and rotational motion with respect to a 
reference point of the target. In order to obtain high 
resolution ISAR imaging, the translational motion must 
firstly be accurately compensated. 
The translational motion compensation can usually be 
divided into two steps: envelope alignment and autofocus. 
There are a number of envelope alignment methods, such as, 
amplitude correlation method [2], improved correlation 
method called averaged correlation method [3], global range 
alignment method [4], and so on. There are also a large 
number of autofocus methods, such as, dominant scatterer 
algorithm [5], maximum-likelihood algorithm [6], centroid 
tracking algorithm [7], multiple PPP algorithm [8], PGA [9], 
contrast optimization algorithm [10], weighted least square 
algorithm [ 11], entropy minimization algorithm [12], 
AUTOCLEAN algorithm [31], and so on. 
After the translational motion is compensated, the target can 
be treated as a rotating target with respect to a reference 
point. The rotation of an ISAR target can roughly be 
categorized into the following three classes [13]: (I)  
unifonn planar rotation with a constant angular velocity, (2) 
0-7803-8155-6/04/$17.00 ©2004 IEEE 1946 
nonuniform planar rotation with a time variant angular 
velocity, and (3) three dimensional (3-0) rotation with pitch, 
roll and yaw. For class (I), the range- Doppler (RD) 
algorithm or polar formation algorithm, can be used to form 
a focused ISAR image [1, 2]. For class (2), interpolation or 
time-frequency techniques can be used to fonn a focused 
ISAR image [13, 14]. For class (3), if the target is small, or 
the required resolution is low, the scatterers' migration 
through resolution cells (MTRC) caused by rotational 
motion can be ignored after range compression. The 
Doppler frequency of each scatterer is time-varying because 
the maneuvering target's rotational velocity and axis vary 
with time. In this case, the time-frequency analysis is used to 
obtain Range- Instantaneous Doppler (RIO) images, and 
imaging problem became an instantaneous Doppler 
parameter estimation problem. A number of estimation 
methods or imaging methods have been proposed, such as, 
joint time-frequency method [15, 16], Radon-Wigner 
method [17], chirplet decomposition method (I8], Extended 
Weighted RELAX method [13], Capon estimator method 
[19], smoothed-pseudo-Wigner-Ville (SPWV) transform 
method [20], 2-D ESPRlT method [25], short time Fourier 
transform method [26], and so on. 
If the target is big, such as big airplane, ship, or the required 
resolution is very high such as 0.15m, the scatterers' MTRC 
caused by rotational motion can not be ignored. In this 
situation, the target's wavenumber support region can not be 
approximated as a rectangular plane or box, the 
wavenumber vectors with different spatial angles are not 
parallel to each other, so range curvature does occur. 
Because the rotation of a non-cooperative maneuvering 
target is usually nonuniform and three-dimensional (pitch, 
roll and yaw), moreover, the rotation is unknown and 
difficult to estimate, the polar formation algorithm is not 
suitable to overcome range curvature or MTRC caused by 
rotational motion. 
In SAR, R.P Perry and Soumekh et a1 [21-23] proposed 
keystone transformation in the fast frequency-slow time 
domain, which can correct moving target's linear range 
migration caused by its linear constant velocity. In this paper 
this keystone transformation is used in ISAR to correct 
range movement (also called linear range migration, linear 
MTRC) caused by target's rotational motion, but keystone 
transformation is done in the fast time after range 
dechirping-slow time domain. 
Before keystone transformation, it is demanded that the 
rawdata is coherent, while in fact, the ISAR rawdata is 
usually not because it is difficult to tracking the target center 
precisely. So a coherent processing of rawdata is proposed. 
In this paper, the rawdata is phase compensated in time 
domain and frequency domain to make it coherent. That is 
to say, on the basis oflhe generallSAR translational motion 
compensation which only the envelope alignment of rang 
image and the auto focus are done, the data are multiplied by 
the linear phase in rang image domain to make the envelope 
of rawdata also align. After this coherent processing the 
rawdata is completely coherent. In the next, the keystone 
transformation is done to correct linear MTRC. 
After range movement correction and range compression, a 
parameter estimation method of multi-component amplitude 
modulation and linear frequency modulation (AM-LFM) 
signal is proposed to estimate the scalterers' instantaneous 
amplitudes and frequencies, and the RID ISAR image is 
obtained. The effective of this algorithm is testified by the 
processing of simulation data. 
For the more, an analysis of velocity compensation of 
missile with high speed before coherent processing and a 
fast realization of keystone transformation are made. The 
one-dimension range image compensation can be done by 
phase compensation in time and frequency domains after the 
target's velocity has been estimated with map drift (MD) 
method commonly used in SAR autofocus. For keystone 
transformation, the fast realization is obtained by discrete 
Fourier transform and inverse fast Fourier transform (DFT­
lFFT). or scaled Fourier transform and inverse fast Fourier 
transform (SFT-IFFT). 
The remainder of this paper is outlined as follows. In 
Section II, the method for the coherent processing of ISAR 
echoes is investigated. In Section Ill, the scatterers' range 
movement correction is discussed. In Section IV, the 
azimuth imaging is presented. The whole algorithm block 
diagram is shown in Section V. The experimental results 
obtained by using simulation radar data are presented in 
Section VI. Finally in Section VII, the conclusion is given. 
In Appendix A, the preprocessing of the echoes of missile 
with high speed is analyzed, and in Appendix B, the fast 
realization of keystone transformation is introduced. 
2. THE COHERENT PROCESSING OF ISAR 
ECHOES 
In theory, the coherent echoes of tSAR can be obtained by 
coherent receiver. In practice, in order to increase transmit 
power, and decrease the receiver bandwidth, the radar 
usually transmits LFM signal, and then dechirps the 
received signal. Suppose the transmitting signal is 
s(i,lm) =rec{ :Jcxp�'2;r(f.:I+V·2 L (I)

1m = mT is slow time.

Suppose the target have Q scatterers, the range of i th 
scatterer from radar is Ri(tm) , the received data is sR(i,lm) ,

where c is the velocity oflight. Because the echoes of every 
scatterers are independent, so the echoes sil�(i,lm) of i th 
scatterer is firstly to be studied, that is 
. (i _ 2R(r liC) j2if{- 2Ri;'ml)+t{r_ 2Rj;'mlr) 
sm(t,tm) = Ajrect ;p m e (3) 
where the range of this i th scatterer from radar is Ri(I",) . 
The reference range of the receiver dechirp signal is got by 
measuring range with low resolution echoed signal, so its 
error is large. Suppose range measured is R.(tm) , then the 
reference signal is

From Eq.(6) above, the received differential frequency is 
single and its value is proportional to the position of the 
scatterer. So, the complicated target's echoes are just the 
range images that take frequency as its parameter. If the 
reference range R,(tm) is very close to the target, the 
bandwidth of the received differential frequency signal can 
be narrow. But From Eq.(6) above, because of the large 
error of the target range R,(/",), moreover, the error is 
random, so the raw received signal is not coherent. 
The movement of ISAR target can be decomposed into 
translational motion and rotational motion. It is needed to 
compensate the translational motion firstly and the target 
can be treated as a rotating target with respect to a reference 
center point. Suppose there is a virtual center point of the 
target 0, its distance from the radar at time t", is Ro(tm)' In 
the following, a discussion of how to compensate the 
received data to make it to be a rotating model is made. 
In the translational motion compensation, it is generally 
divided into two steps in practice, which are envelope 
3 
alignment and the initial phase correction. For the phase 
correction, it is demanded that the phase error be smaller 
than Ir/8 that is corresponding to sub-millimeter, which is 
diffIcult to achieve in practice. But the influence of phase 
error is a value modulo 2lr, so the initial phase correction is 
suffIcient. For envelope alignment, it should be done with 
actual time, but the demanded precision is low, so in this 
paper, two-step compensations are made. 
Suppose the reference range of the dechirping signal is 
R,(tm) , it is needed to compensate to virtual reference range 
RoUm) for dechirping, so a phase compensation function HI 
is constructed as 
HI (i.lm) = srej(i,tm; R,(tm»' s:f(i,lm;RD(t",»)

and RAso(rm)= R.(t",) - Ro(t",), Eq.(7) can be transformed to 
(8) 
After multiplying received signal by HI , the signal of the 
i th scatterer that has been phase compensated is 
s;(;, 1m) = $; (i,lm)H1 (i, 1m)

(10) 
After the compensation of H\(i,f.,) , the phase of signal has 
been compensated to be dechirping form where reference 
range is Ro(tm). But the sampling region still exists error 
because of the difference between R.(tm) and R,(tm) , so it 
needs to compensate, The envelope movement 
compensation can be achieved in frequency domain where 
the second phase term in Eq.(lO) that is residual video phase 
(RVP) can be compensated at the same time. In the 
following, Fourier transform with respect to i, results in [8] 
1948 
According to term sinc(.) of Eq.(12), for the scatterer i 
whose range is Ri{t",l, the range frequency It and range are 
related by /; = - 2r (RjUm) -R. (1m)) • Substituting It and c 
R/uo(tm) =R,(t",)-Ro(lm) into Eq.(l2) results in

After the above processing, it can be seen from Eq.(16) that 
the echoed signal can be compensated to become the 
coherent signal dechirped with virtual center point of the 
target 0 . In order to achieve that, it needs to get accurate 
Rt.>o(lm), while Ro.\"O(t",) is got from envelope alignment, and 
there exists error which is generally smaller than 1/4 ceil in 
envelope alignment, so in the following, an analysis of the 
influence of the envelope error is made. Suppose the 
estimated range difference of the dechirping reference point 
between the target center point is R&.ro," (1m) , which obtained 
by envelope al ignment . the realtionship of the estimated 
Ro.soefT(tm) and the real RAso(lm) is 
R,I,i'Oerr(t",) = RAso(tm)+R/J./T(lml , so the estimation error caused 
by envelope alignment is Rll£rr(t",), Suppose the estimated 
range of target center 0 is R.",(lm) , according to 
Rl!.so(lm) � R,(t.,)-RD(tm) and RAs.err(tm) = R,Um)-R.«lm) , the 
4 
estimated range R .. (tm) is related to the actual Ro(tm) by 
R..,(tm)""R.(tm)-R6.err(tm)' In the actual coherent processing, 
R .. (lm) is used, so Eq.(l5) is

(17) 
In Eq.( 17) above, the initial phase term is the needed term, 
the second phase term is the initial phase error term which is 
caused by the envelope alignment error. The precision of 
envelope alignment is generally smaller than 1/4 resolution 
ceil, that is IRMrr(tmJI :<; L� and 428

Fourier transform of it is

Finally, the comparison of Eq.(16) with Eq.(2D) shows that 
the phase error term of actual coherent processing is 
(2 I) 
As it can be seen, if the errors of sampling position and 
phase are been ignored, Eq.(20) is equivalence to Eq.(16). In 
what follows, a further analysis of Eq.( 16) is made in the 
discussion of the correction of range movement caused by 
rotational motion and azimuth imaging. 
The equation above is the coherent processing for the 
targets, which meet the "stop-go" such as airplane modeL 
For missile with high speed, this signal model is not 
suitable. In this condition, the influence of the target's 
velocity is also needed to take into account in the fast time 
echoed signal of range. As a result, the coherent processing 
of missile's signal is more complicated and it needs 
preprocessing. The detail discussion of that is shown in 
Appendix A. 
3. RANGE MOVEMENT CORRECTION OF 
SCATTERERS 
The azimuth resolution of ISAR depends on the relatively 
rotation of the target. The higher azimuth resolution is, the 
larger the rotation angle needed. Suppose the center 
frequency of the radar is IOGHz, bandwidth of the signal is 
I GHz, the length of the wave is 1 = 0.03m , and thus the 
range resolution is p, = 0.15m . If we let the azimuth 
resolution Pa equal to the range resolution p" the rotation 
angle needed is about t...8 = 1/2t...Pa = 0. 1177rad = 6.7418' . 
Suppose the cross range width of the airplane is Ax =40m, 
thus the maximum of MTRC is ilr=t...06x/2"" 0.1I77x20 
= 2.354m , which is much larger than range resolution. 
Therefore, the range movement caused by rotation must be 
corrected when high resolution image of the target is needed.

Fig.1 3-D rotating target 
After the coherent processing of echoes with respect to the 
center point 0 , with the phase error neglected, the target is 
corresponding to be a three-dimension (3-D) rotating target 
shown in Fig.l. 
Let RI(tm)-Ro(tm) = ,,(1m) , then for the i th scatterer, the range

high-resolution image of target [22].

Here, a time scale transfonn I'm = I + Ie 1m is used, and the 
Ie 
data S(j, tm) is needed to transform to SU, Tm) , which can be 
achieved by interpolative sampling over again, which is 
shown in Fig.2. Appendix B will deal with how to realize 
the interpolation with FFT. 
The inverse Fourier transform in range direction (I domain) 
results in 
(44) 
Now that linear MTRC is compensated, time-frequency 
analysis for every range cell or dechirping processing is 
made to let the echoes to be integrated coherently. 
After range compression, all frequencies are compressed 
upon I'" 0, however, for the time axis of 1=0, according 
to 'm = f + fc 1m , I'm = 1m is got. It is that, it follows that time Ie 
Tm is equal to time 1m • 
At the same time, Eq.(43) is �i(Tm) =¢i(tm) , and it can 
approximately be 
(45) 
After keystone transformation and range compression, the 
i th scatterer's Doppler frequency at time tm = a is 
(46) 
in which Eq.(32) Vilw(O) = Wy (O)xi (0) - wx(O)y;(O) has been 
used, 
After the estimation of the Doppler frequency of the i th 
scatterer at time 1m =0, Range-Instantaneous Doppler (RID) 
image is obtained, 
J(r,ld) '" :f:A;Sinc(2)'fp [r - ri(O)]) ' sinJ TJld - 21G vila/Ol]), (47) 
1:;:1 C \ c 
where 1;, is the azimuth coherent integration time. 
In what is to follow, an analysis of the physical meaning of 
the obtained image, that is the imaging plane, is made. At 
time 0, according to Fig.l, the difference of the i th 
scatterer's range and the center point 0 's range is 
ri(O) =�xl(o)+ y;(O)+(Zj (O)+ Ro(0»2 -Ra(O) 
2 2 (48) 
=Zi(O)+ Xi (0)+ Yi (0) +"'�Zi(O) 2(z; (0) + Ro (0» 
In which, suppose that the target is within a sphere with 
radius of 30m, thus f;(0)i<30m, iYi(OH30m. For the more, 
suppose Ro(O) > 1500m , then the second term of the expansion 
in Eq.(48) is smaller than O.06m which is generally smaller 
1951 
than one resolution ceil (for radar whose bandwidth is lGHz, 
the resolution is O.ISm), so it can be neglected. As a result, 
/j(0) = ";(0) , which is just the z coordinate of the i th 
scatterer in F ig.1. 
In Eq.(46), the Doppler frequency of the j th scatterer at 
time t m = 0 can be further written down as 
2Jm;(0)+ol,(O) "".(0) m,(O) (49) k(O) � [ %;(0) J;(O)] , ,! J"';(O)+m;(O) �"';(o)+m;(o) 
Constructing the projection plane T through z axis and 
perpendicular to the effectual rotating component 
fie = [wz(O),l'lIy(O),ot , at the same time constructing an axis w 
through the center 0 and perpendicular to z axis, which is 
just shown in Fig. I. Thus the coordinate of the projection 
point of scatterer on the projection plane T is 
_ (0,(0) wAO) . (SO) (Wj(O),zp(O»-( x;(O)- I . 
y;(O),z;CO)) �w;(O}+ w�(O) \fw;(O} + m�(O) 
By cross range scaling, multiplying fd j (0) in Eq.( 49) by 
J , we can obtain that its result is equal to the 
2�l'lI;(0) + �(O) 
horizontal coordinate w, (0) of the scatterer on the projection 
plane T. 
The analysis above indicates that the RID image obtained of 
the target is just the projection of the target's scatterers on 
the Plane T, that is the imaging plane at time 1m =0 is just 
the projection plane T that is perpendicular to the effectual 
rotating component at time IHI = 0 , 
4. ISAR AzIMUTH IMAGING 
In section above, after the range compression of the target's 
echoes, the signal has been compressed to a point in any 
range direction, but because of the influence of �(l'm)' in 
azimuth direction is it generally a nonstationary signal with 
. modulation ratio which sometimes has more· higher order 
term, Suppose there are P scatterers' signal in a range cell, 
according to Eq.(44) and Eq.(45), each azimuth echo of this 
range cell is 
(51 ) 
,,,,I 
where fOj = fd, (0) , here it is written as fo; for 
convenience in the following, Thus Eq,( 51) is 
.f j2I1'UO,/m"'!'.uo,/l+.L1/o,/�+"·)+ j'PO; s(tm)= "",A,e 2 6 ) . 
;�I 
(S2) 
Eq.(S2) also indicates that s(lm) is a nonstationary signal. 
By the section above it can be concluded that it is needed to 
7 
get the Doppler frequency h, (0) , that is fo; of any scatterer 
i at 1m = 0 , as a result, it needs to estimate fo; from Eq.(S2). 
In Eq,{S2), the amplitudes of the echoes of every scatterer 
i are equaivalent, which is impossible in practice, so we 
substitute aj(tm) for A; • Therefore, the echoes of every 
scatterer can be look as amplitude modulate-frequency 
modulate (AM-FM) signal. To a certian extent, AM-FM 
signal is approximate to amplitude modulate-linear 
frequency modulate (AM-LFM) signal, or segment AM­
LFM, thus signal of any range cell in Eq.(52) is the multi­
component AM-LFM signal under the noise and clutter 
condition. As a result, azimuth imaging is a parameter 
estimate problem of multi-component AM-LFM signal 
under the noise and clutter condition. 
Therefore, for Eq.(S2), it can be expressed by using a AM­
LFM signal model containing P components as 
p )·2 .... ( '0' ..+, ... . /2 )+)'-( ) _ � ( ) "i m 2"'" m �; ( ) stm -L.a, 1m e +etm , 
j=-l 
(53) 
where a;(lm) is a real variable, for constant amplitude LFM 
signal, a;(lm) is a constant, in which we assume that the 
amplitude variation is slow, and its spectrum is narrow. In 
fact, s(lm) is linear superimpose of multi AM-LFM 
component, so we only need to analysis one component, that 
is 
j2J1'uorm+1JJQI;')+ j'PO (54) s(lm) = a(lm)e +e(I",). 
Fourier transform of s(lm) is 
. . 2 
F[s(lm)]=e}'POF[a(tm)]05(f - fo)®F[e-ill/Jotm]+F{e(lm)]. (55) 
Because the variation of a(lm) is slow, F[aUm)] is a narrow 
spectrum centered in zeros frequency. 5(f -10) is 
modulation, which will shift the spectrum, F[ejll/Jot1 J is the 
spectrum of chirp factor, the greater JI<J is, the wider 
spectrum is . 
It is usually to use dechirping method to estimate chirp rate 
Po , that is multiply s(lm) by negative chirp rate factor 
.1 2 
e-J"2"'m , which results in 
(56) 
If K' "" 14J, then fr(t",) "" a(tm)t!2;rfO'm+j'PO , the Fourier transform 
of frUm) is F[J,(lml] = "j'PO F[a(tm)] 0 o(f - fol , which is a 
narrow spectrum around initial frequency fo ' From the 
position of peak, fo is estimated, The search method of fa 
is: change T(, and do FFT for each fy(tm) , and draw two 
dimensional distribution along initial frequency fa and 
chirp rate T( ,  and estimate two parameter fo and Po of 
LFM component from the peak 
1952 
After estimated initial frequency fo and chirp rate 110 , 
dechirping the original component and shift it to zero 
frequency, then 
(57) 
By Fourier transfonn, the phase of zero frequency is the 
estimation of 11\). By filter the narrow spectrum around zero 
frequency, and do inverse Fourier transfonn, the estimation 
of aUm) is obtained, in order to reduce sidelobe, taylor or 
hamming window is needed when do Fourier transform and 
after inverse Fourier transform it is needed to divide the 
result by window coefficient 
For multi-component AM-LFM signal, many peaks are 
emerged in two dimensional distribution map (the initial 
frequency f and chirp rate J( ), according to the position of 
peaks, the estimation of fo, and 110; are obtained. At these 
peaks' position, filter the narrow spectrum along the initial 
frequency f direction, shift it to center, and do inverse 
Fourier transform, the estimation of each component a;(lm) 
is obtained. 
Because the search of the initial frequency I and chirp rate 
f( in two dimension is time consuming, especially the 
higher precision of f( is, the greater search computation 
load is, so we adopt "clean" method to estimate AM-LFM 
component from great to small. 
Suppose one range cell signal is composed by P AM-LFM 
components and white noise, the slow time 1m ;,mT, where 
T is pulse repetition period, so the signal s(tm) can be 
written as, 
s(mT)�±a,(mT)ej2"O;"'T+jn;<.;(",T)2+i""; +e(mT), m � I,···,M. (58)

The k th AM-LFM component's initial frequency 10k and 
chirp rate )JOk are determined by the peak of two 
dimensional distribution C(f.K) of sk_,(mT), 
C(f,/C);, I{[sk_,(mT).e-J2J(Oimr-j...-(",rj2]}! M, (59) m=l 
(60) 
where ,._,(mT) is remainder signal obtained by subtracting 
the estimated k-I AM-LFM components from original 
signal, and where arg expresses to get the independent 
variable of the fimction. The estimate of 10k and JIfl. can be 
obtained quickly by utilizing FFT.

The initial phase is the phase of peak,

where L expresses to get angle. 
(62)

Suppose Wink (f) ;, {ol fLk < II < fRk is filtering window of esc 
k th component in frequency domain, and iRk > 0, I£k < 0 , 
whose value is determined by spectral width of peak which 
is shifted to zeros. The discrete fonn of Wink(f) can be 
written as Wink(�)' The time variation amplitude is IFFT 
module of filtered spectrum peak, which is shifted to zero 
frequency, that is, 
ak(mT) =IIFFT{Wind l:'rJ' FFT[Sk_' (mT) . e -J<I'k(mTj-jfuk lll. (63) 
where <l>k(mT);, 2,(OkmT + jlr[Jo.(mT)2 . 
After subtracting k th AM-LFM component in frequency 
domain from St_, (mT), Sk (mT) is obtained, 
s,(mT) = IFfTlIl- Win.(;;;'Jl' FFT[sk-\(mTje-J ... ( .. T)Jj ,.,,">(mT) (64) 
Now, we give the step of AM-LFM signal's parameter 
estimation method as follow: 
Step(J): k=l, that is '-o(mT);,s(mTj, according to Eqs. (61), 
(62) and (63) the first AM-LFM component's initial 
frequency, chirp rate, initial phase and time variant 
amplitude are estimated, then according to Eq'(64) the 
reminder signal sl(mT) is obtained by subtracting this AM­
LFM component from original signal. 
Step(2): k= 2 ,  according to Eqs. (61), (62) and (63) the 
second AM-LFM component's initial frequency, chirp rate, 
initial phase and time variant amplitude are estimated, then 
by subtracting the second AM-LFM component from s,(mT) 
according to Eq.(64), the reminder signal s2(mT) is obtained. 
Remaining steps: when k;,K, according to Eqs. (61), (62) 
and (63), the K th AM-LFM component's parameters are 
estimated, then subtracting the K th AM-LFM component 
from sk_,(mT) according to Eq.(64), the remainder signal 
sK(mT) is obtained. If the reminder signal's energy is small 
enough, or K reaches the required component number P, 
the iterative is end. 
In the estimation processing, expect K needed searching, 
else parameters only need simple FFT, getting maximum 
and multiplying, so it is easy to realize and the computer 
efficiency is high. Moreover, the parameter Pot can be 
searched step by step to reduce computation load, each step 
have eleven points, usually it only needs to search three or 
four steps. 
5. BLOCK DIAGRAM OF ISAR IMAGING 
ALGORITHM 
The key to the high-resolution imaging is that the range 
1953 
movement caused by rotational motion must be 
compensated. When the target is rotating, the scatterers' 
range movement rates are different, and keystone 
transformation can correct range movement with different 
rate at the same time, but it is demanded the signal before 
keystone transformation be coherent. In this paper, ISAR 
echoes is first to be make coherent with virtual center 0 of 
the target, so that the target can be treated as a three� 
dimensional rotating target that is rotating with respect to 
the virtual center 0 , which is equivalent to the dechiping 
referent point. Secondly, the range movement correction is 
done. For the range alignment with virtual center 0 , many 
envelope alignment algorithms, such as amplitude 
correlation method and minimum entropy method, can be 
used to estimate R6s. (t",) which is used in phase 
compensation function HI and H2 • For autofocus, many 
autofocus algorithms such as multiple PPP algorithm and 
PGA can be used to estimate phase compensation function 
H1 • In conventional translational motion compensation 
(TMC), phase compensation function H2 does not do, that 
is, rawdata envelopes usually need not to compensation. 
After coherent processing with the virtual center 0 ,  for a 
steadily flying target, the target's rotation is uniform and 
planar, the received data is same to the data received by a 
spotlight SAR in polar format, so the polar formation is 
usually used. But for a non-cooperative target, the rotation is 
usually nonuniform and three-dimensional (pitch, roll and 
yaw), as a result, the polar format algorithm is not suitable. 
For this situation, keystone transformation is used to correct 
MTRC, certainly, it only correct linear range migration and 
can not completely correct MTRC. After the range 
compression, the time-frequency analysis is made to 
estimate scatterers' instantaneous Doppler frequencies for 
each range celL Finally, the target's RID image is obtained.

6. ISAR IMAGING OF SIMULATION DATA 
In what follows, there is an example of ISAR imaging of 
simulation data. It is a Yak-42 aircraft model with 330 
scatterers shown in FigA, and its length, width and height is 
separately 70m, 60m and 9m. The radar center frequency is 
1 0GHz, bandwidth is 1 000Ivlliz, pulse repeat frequency 
(PRF) is 50Hz, and the fast time (range direction) sample 
rate is 40MHz. The model is flying in a curve, and the target 
range is 400 kilometer. The range measuring precision is 
±lOm, that is say, the position error of dechirp reference 
signal and target center is within ±l Om.

42 aircraft 
Fig.5(a) shows the simulation data in the range fast time and 
azimuth slow time domain after receiver dechirping 
processing. In Fig.5(b) the envelope of range image after 
IFFT is shown, and because the referent signal is not 
accurately tracking the target's center, the range image is 
saltant and not align. Fig.5(c) shows the RD image obtain by 
conventional motion compensation that is range image 
envelope alignment and autofocus. As it is shown, the 
scatterers are defocus seriously and form a slant line. It also 
shows that the MTRC of scatterers exits and the azimuth 
Doppler varies with time. After the range image envelope 
alignment and autofocus, returning to the range fast time 
and azimuth slow time domain, but without phase 
compensation H2 , that is there is not the translational 
motion correction of rawdata' s  envelope, keystone 
transformation is done to correct the range movement, the 
range image obtained in Fig.5(d). In this condition, because 
the raw range is not completely coherent, keystone 
interpolation is not accurate, and the envelope is disorder, 
the ratio of signal to noise is low. Fig.5(e) shows the general 
RD image of the Fig.( d) data. Fig.5Ct) is the RID image of 
the Fig.(d) data using AM-FM signal parameter estimation 
method proposed in the paper to estimate instantaneous 
Doppler parameter. As it is shown, the image is bad. Fig.5(g) 
is RD image after completely coherent processing but 
without MTRC, this image is more better than Fig.5(c), but 
defocus and range movement are still exist. Fig.5(h) is the 
1954 
range image after completely coherent processing and 
keystone transformation. The range movement of the 
scatterers is eliminated. Fig.5(i) is the RD image of Fig.5(h) 
data, comparison of Fig.5(c) with Fig.5(i) shows that in 
Fig.5(i) the scatterers are defocus only in cross range 
direction, it can show than the range movement is eliminated 
but the Doppler frequency is still time-variable. Fig.5(j) is 
the RID image ofFig.5(h) after azimuth imaging using AM­
LFM parameter estimation method, that is, Fig.5(i) is the 
finally RID image result of simulation data with the block 
diagram processing of FigJ. As we can see, the imaging 
result is very good.

7. CONCLUSION 
In the ISAR imaging with high resolution, after the 
translational motion compensation of the target, the MTRC 
caused by rotational motion is also needed to be 
compensation. Because the target is non-cooperative, and 
the rotating angle of the target is nonuniform and three­
dimensional, it is not suitable for the polar formation 
algorithm. In this paper, keystone transformation proposed 
in SAR imaging for moving target is used to correct the 
linear range migration caused by rotation. 
Because the dechirp referent point of the ISAR rawdata 
varies with the movement of the target, moreover it is 
difficult to precisely tracking the target center, the rawdata is 
not coherent. 
In this paper, the rawdata is separately phase compensated in 
time domain and frequency domain to make it coherent, it is 
that, on the basis of the general ISAR imaging in which only 
the envelope alignment of rang image and the auto focus are 
done, we multiply the data by the linear phase in rang image 
domain to make the envelope of raw returned data also align, 
so the raw returned data is completely coherent. In the next, 
the keystone transformation is done to correct linear MTRC. 
After the correction of MTRC and compression of range, a 
parameter estimation method of multicomponent amplitude 
modulation and linear frequency modulation(AM-LFM) 
signal is fmally proposed to estimate the scatterer's 
instantaneous amplitudes and frequencies, and the 
instantaneous ISAR image is obtained.

The comparison of those with Eq.(6) shows that 'l'a(I,I.,} '"

general target with low speed, 
Firstly the initial phase cause by high speed target, the linear 
phase that brings about range image shift and the second 
order phase term that widen range image 's spectrum are 
compensated, and the compensating function is constructed 
as

Suppose the referent dechirping range of rawdata is Rs (rm ) , 
in order to compensate it to dechirped signal with referent 
range Ra (tm )  , construct the phase compensating function Hl 
as

The following processing is the same as the steps behind

The Velocity Estimate Methodfor Missile 
The analysis before shows that it is needed to know the 
target's velocity in the beforehand coherent processing of 
the missile with high speed, The target's velocity can be 
obtained by two methods: I) estimate from dechirp 
reference ranges; 2) estimate from the frequency modulation 
rate of every range image whose spectrum has widened, that 
is, estimate from <l>3h in Eq.(A- IS) (where $3h can 
11 b . • 411" . 2R (I ) 2 ) genera y e approximate to <J>Jb(t,tmJ "' --rVr(/ __ ,_m_) , C c 
and the frequency modulation rate of every range image can 
be estimated by MD method that is usually used in SAR 
imaging [8]. Suppose the unitary .frequency modulation rate 
estimated from the m th range image is k(rn) , then the actual 
frequency modulation rate is k,(rn) = k(m) . F/ , where F, is 
range sampling rate, As a result, the estimated velocity of 
the target at slow time 1m = mT is 
V ( J "' - kr(m) · c  e lm • 4r

After the velocity estimation from all range images, it is 
needed to use second order or third order curve-fitting to 
promote the precision of velocity estimation

Eq.(B- I )  can be simplified as,

Because in fact the received data is discrete, so Eq,(B-2) can
