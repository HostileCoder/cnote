Abstract 
The limitation of IPv4 becomes a big problem. To 
resolve the problems, IPv6 is proposed and now growing. 
Various projects, such as WIDE project and TAO are 
making big efforts to promote IPv6. Tottori University of 
Environmental Studies (TUES) met the problem of IPv4. 
Though using IPv6 should be a good solution to the 
problem, there were some problems when we used IPv6 
on JGN. We tried to transfer data of archaeological 
photographs from Tokyo to Tottori. The amount of the 
data is more than 75GB. The other application is to find 
the activity of web pages on the IPv6 Internet. We will 
describe the details in this paper. In shortly, the problems 
we met were similar to problems that we experienced with 
IPv4 network about fifteen years ago. 
1. Introduction 
The limitation of IPv4 becomes a big problem. As 
many readers know, lack of address is one of the most 
serious problems especially in Asian countries. IPv6 has 
been proposed to resolve the problems that IPv4 have. 
The detail of IPv6 is still discussing and implementing 
though the basics were already implemented. In these 
years, there are number of efforts to construct the IPv6 
Internet. In Japan, WIDE project operates 6bone-JP and 
the IPv6 internet exchange. From 1999, 
Telecommunications Advancement Organization (TAO) 
began to operate Japan Gigabit Network (JGN). There are 
number of access points, at least one access point for a 
prefecture. From 2001, JGN began to accept IPv6 traffic. 
This situation makes IPv6 research easy for research 
institutes. 
Tottori University of Environmental Studies (TUES) 
was established in 2001. All students are undergraduates. 
There is a plan to establish a graduate school in the near 
future. As TUES is a young university, the university is 
now equipping with things needed for researches. We 
prepared the IPv4 Internet Connection by an ISP. We met 
the lack of IPv4 address. We could not prepare IPv4 
address for all students and faculties. At TUES, all 
students have their own note PCs as teaching materials. 
As the number of students for one grade is more than 320, 
we need more than one and half thousands of IP address. 
This situation was a big motivation for us to use IPv6. 
Fortunately, we got a chance to use JGN and we 
investigate the IPv6 network from two points of view. 
One is that of file transferring. The other is that of web 
accessing. We will describe the details of our result in this 
paper. 
In the rest of this section, we describe the outline of 
IPv6 connection at TUES. TUES was connected to JGN 
in October 2002 to proceed researches related to IPv6. 
JGN has an access point at Tottori University with the 
interface of OC-3. The distance between TUES and 
Tottori University is about 10km. The speed of the access 
line is 100Mbps, Fast Ethernet. The campus network of 
TUES is based on IPv4. We constructed a new network 
only for IPv6. This means that the new network uses only 
IPv6. Computers connected the new network should use 
IPv6. If a computer has only one network interface, the 
computer should use network services via IPv6 including 
DNS. 
The authors used this network to study the 
effectiveness of IPv6 network. First, we transferred a big 
volume of image data. Secondary, we investigated web 
accessibility in the IPv6 Internet in Japan. 
2. Details of transferred data 
In this section, we describe what kind of data we 
transferred. The authors are also studying metadata of 
archaeological photographs to preserve in digital format.

An archaeologist took many photographs of historical 
sites, ruins and relics. Taking photographs of such things 
is very important because distributions of relics 
sometimes tell archaeologists meaningful information. To 
make comparative study between historical sites, 
archaeologists compare photographs of historical sites. 
Thus circulation of such photographs is very important. 
We digitized a volume of photographs of historical sites 
for our study. As the authors work in Tottori and Tokyo, 
we have to have same digital data of the photographs. 
Originally, the data were only in Tokyo. We transferred 
the data from Tokyo to Tottori via IPv6 Internet. The 
volume of the photographs is more than 75GB. Figure 1 
shows an example of the photographs. We placed an 
order with a company for the digitization of photographs. 
3. File Transfer Tool 
Generally, transferring the data from Tokyo to 
Tottori, FTP program is appropriate. However, there were 
some problems about firewall, protocol, and file transfer 
system for using FTP program. In this section, we 
summarize these problems and describe a tool, WebDAV 
(World Wide Web Distributed Authoring and 
Versioning) that we adopted. 
3.1 Environment and problems 
The problems about file transfer from Tokyo to 
Tottori are below: 
1. Reliability of the network 
2. Kanji characters in file name 
3. Firewall policy of the organization 
4. To use IPv6 application 
The reason why FTP program is not useful to 
transfer the data was that the network was not reliable for 
sending flood of data, as described in section 3.2. Though 
network managers attempted to fix the network problems, 
the quality of stability was not enough to keep 
transferring large data using FTP program. FTP program 
dose not have facilities to re-try and re-send when a 
network replies error such as time-out, packet loss, etc. If 
FTP connection is finished with network error as we send 
a file, we have to send again the file from the beginning. 
Additionally, FTP program dose not detect whether a file 
is transferred completely or not in a directory, when we 
use wild card to point files in program argument. It makes 
hard to manage about 5 thousands file transfer, because 
we have to check whether each file for is send correctly.  
As a matter of fact, FTP program was finished by error at 
intervals of a few minutes. Thus, other useful file transfer 
tool is required to send large size a large amount of files.   
The other problem is that the files are named using 
Japanese SJIS code to encode kanji characters. FTP 
program cannot transfer Kanji character, two-byte 
character file name sometime.  It was not possible to 
convert over 5-thousand file name. And converted fine 
name has less information that original name, because 
Kanji character is ideogram. Japanese Kanji characters 
have a lot of information in one character. For example, 
“Kurayoshi-Iseki” needs 8 bytes to write by Kanji 
character, though same meaning alphabetical word 
“Kurayoshi historical site” uses twenty-three bytes. These 
digitized photographs were originally taken at Japanese 
historical site. Thus, the photographs are arranged and 
stored using Japanese historical name and kanji. These 
kind of Japanese names are familiar with Japanese 
archaeologist. It was strongly required to keep Kanji 
character file name. 
Recently, firewall policy of the organization limits 
to use application to keep security. FTP program packets 
are prohibited to send from Tokyo to Tottori. Since HTTP 
packets are admitted to transfer, file transfer program 
using HTTP is needed.  
The most important challenge is that TUES has IPv6 
address only. A few program was implemented for IPv6, 
however, we had to select a program carefully, because 
some programs need the environment that is supported 
IPv4 and IPv6. 
3.2 WebDAV as file transfer tool 
To solve these problems, we adopted WebDAV [1] 
program. WebDAV is “Web-based Distributed Authoring 
and Versioning”. It is a set of extensions to the HTTP 
protocol that allows users to collaboratively edit and 
manage files on remote web servers. WebDAV is 
implemented as a part of apache 2. Apache 2 also 
supports IPv6. There is a patch for supporting Japanese 
Kanji characters in file name. 
We built WebDAV server on FreeBSD at TUES, 
and WebDAV clients on Windows XP at Tokyo. In 
Tokyo, we have two network access points to send data. 
One is from IIJ broadband network, about 33Mbps, the 
other is from ADSL network, about 0.5Mbps, shown as 
Figure 2. When we connect using WebDAV client to 
WebDAV server though http, we can move and copy 
remote files on the local machine. It is easy to move file 
from Tokyo to TUES, since WebDAV provides folder 
like GUI tool to handle files as if we move file in local 
directory. WebDAV manages to file transfer when 
network condition is unreliable. However, since 
sometimes WebDAV reported error to transfer file, we 
had to check whether a file is transferred completely. In 
next section, we describe network condition.

4. Network condition 
Network managers that operate JGN IPv6 network 
were expert and they had much experience to operate 
IPv4 network. However, in present, it seems that there are 
some problems to operate IPv6 network. Since we are not 
network manager and cannot solve and/or analyze 
problems, we can report network condition from user 
point of view. 
4.1 Datalink problem 
Observed problem is that FTP program is finished 
abnormally while data is transferred. Since PING 
command did not report an error, Datalink is doubted to 
have some troubles. In the backbone, some errors were 
detected in a wide area Ethernet line. On the end point, 
ADSL access line was disconnected sometimes. A 
network operator fixed both problems, instantly. Quality 
of network were improved, however, network connection 
was not stable yet.  
4.2 Routing problems 
Trouble of routing configuration occurred twice 
while we transferred photograph data for two months. 
First time, it was observed packet loss because 
TRACEROUTE command replied fine routing 
information. Since TUES found they could not access and 
reach some WWW server, router configuration was 
detected.  
Second time, TUES was not discovered and 
connected from Tokyo one day. TRACEROUTE said 
routing information was not right from Tokyo to Tottori. 
It became clear that configuration in the router was 
mistaken when router was replaced.  
This kind of miss operation shows that IPv6 network 
operation has not maturity enough compare with IPv4 
network. Experiments of operating IPv6 network on JGN 
must be very fruitful to develop and deploy IPv6.  
4.3 Continuous data stream 
We could not solve trouble that packets are reachable 
to the server using PING and TRACEROUTE command, 
but FTP and WebDAV session often disconnected. Since 
the amount of transferred data is 75GB, data packets 
continue to flow for a long time. It is not clear that which 
component caused this problem. Problems must be caused 
not only by network configuration and equipment but also 
end system. We used FreeBSD for WebDAV server and 
Windows XP for WebDAV client. IPv6 protocol stack 
and applications are developing at this time. A lot of IPv6 
experiments collaborate with real application might 
accelerate to develop and deploy IPv6 network.
5. Web Hosts on IPv6 
AT TUES, there are two campus-networks. One is 
based on IPv4, and the other is based on IPv6. No part of 
campus-network accepts both IPv4 and IPv6 at the same 
time. TUES is connected to the Internet via commercial 
ISP with IPv4 and connected to the Internet via JGN with 
IPv6. Figure 3 illustrates this situation. 
At this point, only 128 IPv4-addresses are assigned 
to TUES. On the other hand, all students have their own 
note PC as his/her teaching materials. Off course, students 
use the Internet via campus-network. They use e-mail, 
web browsing and some other internet services. To 
provide internet services such as web browsing, we use 
the NAPT and local address of IPv4 to connect the note 
PC of students simultaneously. To use the bandwidth of a 
line to the ISP, we use an http proxy server. Though 
TUES has IPv6 connection to the 6bone, only limited 
persons can access to the IPv6 network directly. IPv6 
network is still in experience.

Similar to many universities, most of traffic at 
TUES is for access to web pages. If we have an 
appropriate proxy server that uses IPv6 connection as 
well as IPv4, we can improve the efficiency. We made 
efforts to find out such kind of http proxy server. The 
proxy server has to satisfy a following condition: the 
proxy server accesses via IPv6 if a host is IPv6 reachable. 
We found that there is no proxy server that satisfies our 
condition. We also found that it’s easy to modify 
wwwoffle[2] to meet with our request. The modification 
was only several lines or around. As wwwoffle is 
designed for personal use, the program has no capabilities 
to serve for many requests from many clients. We used 
the software with some clients. The program works well. 
Using modified wwwoffle, clients on the IPv4 
campus network can access to the hosts on the IPv6 
Internet. If a host is connected to both IPv4 Internet and 
IPv6 Internet, our modified wwwoffle retrieves web 
contents of the host via IPv6 instead of IPv4. One of 
objectives of the modified wwwoffle is to make IPv4 
clients easy access to IPv6 web hosts. Figure 4 shows the 
role of the proxy. 
Using this mechanism, we can increase traffic of 
IPv6 and decrease that of IPv4. It is easy to understand 
that our modified wwwoffle increase the traffic of IPv6. 
But how much the program increases the traffic? The 
answer should be “It depends on the number of web hosts 
on the IPv6 network.” Who knows the number of web 
hosts on the IPv6 Internet? It is very difficult to answer 
this question. But, it is easy to know some of the web 
hosts on the IPv6 Internet if we add some codes to our 
modified wwwoffle. Table 1 shows the hostnames 
detected by our program. A couple of faculty of TUES 
used our modified wwwoffle as a proxy server for their 
web browser from September 2003.  
There are 46 sites in Table 1. We can see the names 
of IPv6 related projects, ISPs, companies. The number of 
sites is not big. Is the number of IPv6 ready-sites so 
small? To find the answer, we made access to official 
web pages of Japanese universities. At universities, many 
researchers are working. The possibility having web page 
on the IPv6 Internet is higher than other organizations. In 
Japan, it is easy to get a list of URL of universities. These 
two points are the reasons why we chose Japanese 
universities. As a list of official web pages, we used 
http://www.yozemi.ac.jp/daigaku/. (This page is written 
in Japanese.) Using this page, we made access to official 
web pages of universities and found that only three 
universities have IPv6 address for their sites. More than 
400 universities do not have IPv6 address for their

official web sites!! Additionally, only one university 
provides their official web page via IPv6. Though the rest 
universities have IPv6 address for their official sites, we 
could not reach the sites. In fact, only one Japanese 
university provides their official web pages via IPv6.  
From the point of view of users, there is no 
motivation to use IPv6 if the user cannot retrieve any 
information from IPv6 Internet. If we want IPv6 to be 
more popular, we have to make much more web pages on 
the IPv6 Internet. 
6. Conclusion 
In this paper, we described experiments done at 
Tottori University of Environmental Studies using JGN 
v6. We transferred a large size of image data from Tokyo 
to Tottori. Though we tried to use FTP first, we met 
various difficulties. To avoid the problems, we used 
WebDAV and succeeded to transfer the data. We also 
investigated the actual situation of Web sites on the IPv6 
Internet. What we experienced during our research is very 
similar to the situation of IPv4 Internet of fifteen years 
ago. It may take a little more time IPv6 to be popular. The 
authors hope that IPv6 network became more popular 
than IPv4 network in the near future. A lot of experiments 
of both IPv6 application and operating IPv6 network on 
JGN should accelerate to develop and deploy IPv6 
network.
