Abstract- Sun sensors have been widely used as a part of 
spacecraft attitude determination subsystems to provide a 
measurement of the sun vector in spacecraft coordinates. An 
experimental Micro Electro Mechanical System (MEMS) 
based sun sensor is presented in this paper. This prototype 
sun sensor is comprised of a silicon wafer mask with several 
hundred small apertures placed on top of a Charge Coupled 
Device (CCD) focal plane array at a distance of 750 
microns. An image of the apertures is formed on the focal 
plane when the sun illuminates this setup. Sun angles can be 
derived by analyzing the image. The experimental data 
presented indicates that this sun sensor can achieve 
accuracies on the order of a few arcminutes or better. It is 
projected that this type of sun sensor, utilizing an Active 
Pixel Sensor (APS) focal plane array, will be the size of 
three dimes stacked on top of each other. It will have a mass 
of less than 30g and consume less than 20 mW. This will 
make this type of sun sensor ideal for micro/nano spacecraft 
and small rovers.

FUTURE DIRECTION OF THE PROJECT 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Future micro/nano spacecraft and rovers will need to carry 
sun sensors to determine the pointing direction towards the 
sun or position determination. Conventional sun sensors are 
typically too large compared to the size of a micro/nano 
spacecraft or a small rover. Therefore, research into MEMS 
based sun sensors has been initiated. 
Two categories of conventional sun sensors exist - digital 
and analog types. The digital sun sensors illuminate a 
geometric pattern on the detector plane. The presence or 
absence of light in these well-defined areas defines a digital 
signal that can be translated into the sun angle. An analog 
sun sensor outputs analog currents, from which the sun 
angles can be derived [ 11. 
A new generation of sun sensors is emerging. These sun 
sensors utilize an imaging chip as detector plane with a 
mask placed in front of it. The sun sensor determines the 
sun angles based on an image of fiinges or centroids on the 
detector plane [2], [3], and [4]. 
At the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of 
Technology there is currently an ongoing multi-year 
research task to miniaturize sun sensor technology utilizing 
MEMS technology. In the initial stages of the project, a 
large number of masks with different patterns have been 
manufactured utilizing MEMS technology. The masks 
include patterns that will support one or two axes sun angle 
determination. The MEMS masks were manufactured out of 
a 500-micron thick silicon wafer. 
This paper describes the mask designs, the simulations and 
the experimental results. The algorithms used to determine 
the sun angle and the calibration are also included. 
Future directions for this task are also discussed. A feasible 
route might be to utilize an APS chip as the focal plane 
array with automatic centroid calculation included in the 
focal plane electronics [5 ] .  
The final product of this research task will be to 
demonstrate a prototype sun sensor, the size of three dimes 
stacked on top of each other. 
2. MEMS BASED SUN SENSOR 
The key component of this highly accurate and very small 
sun sensor is the high-resolution multi aperture mask placed 
close to the focal plane. The basic concept is shown in 
Figure 1. The gray spots on the bottom plate indicate where 
the shadows of the aperture from the top plate fall.

The typical size of a focal plane is less than lcm x llcm and 
the size of the individual pixels is on the order of 10 
microns. The size of the pattern on the mask must be 
smaller than the size of the focal plane. It is assumed that 
the accuracy of the sun sensor is proportional to the square 
root of the number of apertures. It is desired to have a large 
number of apertures. The mask should therefore be on the 
order of millimeters on the side and have hundreds of 
apertures. 
llllllll 
It is very difficult to machine features smaller than a few 
hundred microns in metal. Therefore, the masks were made 
from a 6-inch diameter by 500-micron thick silicoin wafer. 
The size of each mask was 7 mm x 7 mm. There was room 
on the 4-inch wafer for more than a hundred masks. 
Primarily, two different kinds of mask patterns were 
produced - slits and round apertures. A large number of 
different aperture diameters, aperture spacing, slit width and 
slit spacing ranging from 1 micron to 512 microns were 
manufactured. The round apertures will provide 2-axis 
determination of the sun whereas the slits will only provide 
one-dimensional determination of the sun angle. Figure 2 
shows an example of the mask patterns. This paper will only 
discuss the masks with round apertures.

Before the masks were manufactured, a Matlab simulation 
was performed to determine the intensity of the sun at a 
distance of 500 microns behind the mask. The result of a 32 
micron round aperture is shown in Figure 3. In the 
simulations, it 'was assumed that the sun had an angular 
extension of 0.5'. It was also assumed that it was a black 
body at :jSOOK.

shown. 
Figure 4. MEMS miasks 
This initial stage of the project has concentmted on the 
optical and accuracy aspects of the concept and not focused 
on the miniaturization of the system. Therefore, a 
commercial CCD camera with PC interface and acquisition 
software was procured. The ST-71 camera from SBIC was 
chosen [ti]. It is equipped with a Kodak KAF-0401E CCD 
chip [7]. The original CCD chip in the camera was replaced 
with a :similar chip procured directly from Kodak and 
delivered without the protective cover glass. An existing 
bracket used to clamp the CCD chip to the therm0 electric 
cooler was modified and the MEMS mask was glued to this 
bracket. This places the MEMS mask approximately 750 
microns from the focal plane in the camera. This setup 
worked well. A picture of the prototype setup is shown in 
Figure 5. The Figure also shows 3 brackets with the MEMS 
masks glued on them. 
With tht: described setup a maximurn theoretical field of 
view of approximately 160' is possible. At this angle only a 
few apertures would be visible and the accuracy would be 
reduced.

3. ALGom1s 
CCD chips typically have a stellar sensitivity of 
approximately 12000 photoelectrons for a magnitude 0 star 
3-1566 
(same spectral class as the sun) for a 1-second exposure 
time and an aperture area of 1 mm' [SI. The sun has a 
magnitude on -26.8. This is 4.62~10" times brighter than a 
magnitude 0 star. The exposure time was 110 ms. The 
diameter of the aperture is 32 microns. The aperture area is 
therefore S X ~ O - ~  mm2. A single aperture will therefore 
generate 12000 e-/mm2-s x 4.62~10'~ x 8x104 mm' x 0.1 1 s 
= 4.9~10" photoelectrons per exposure. The image of the 
aperture is distributed on, say, 5 x 5 pixels so only 1.9.10' 
photoelectrons will be generated in a single pixel. The full 
well capacity of a single pixel is less than 2.5~10~ 
photoelectrons. Therefore, this prototype setup was placed 
under direct sun using a neutral density filter on lo6 power 
to avoid saturating the camera CCD. An image acquired by 
the camera is shown in Figure 6. The distance between the 
apertures are 256 microns, the diameter of the apertures are 
32 microns. The image covers an area of 6.91 mm x 4.6 mm 
In Figure 6, it is observed that the mask substrate transmits a 
significant amount of light. This was unexpected. The mask 
is very thin and the silicon is transmitting 23% of the light. 
In future versions of the mask, the surface will be made 
opaque by applying a black coat on it. Also, a few 
impurities on the mask can be observed in the Figure. The 
coating will eliminate this as well. 
In the image a pattem of approximately 200 equally spaced 
apertures is observed. It is the position of this pattem that 
changes as a function of the sun angles. In order to calculate 
the sun angles, the positions of the aperture centroids on the 
focal plane have to be calculated. This type of image 
processing is routinely done in star trackers [9], where the 
centroids of bright spots (stars) are found in an image.

The result of the centroiding algorithm applied to the image 
shown in Figure 6 is shown in Figure 8. The centroids are 
shown with a *. The algorithm is purposely set to not search 
for centroids near the border of the image. Note that the 
impurity in the lower left comer of the MEMS mask is, 
mistakenly, being identified as an aperture by the algorithm. 
Typically, the image is sifted for pixels that are above a 
given threshold. Once a pixel is detected, a region of interest 
(ROI) window is aligned with the detected pixel in the 
center. The average pixel value on the border is calculated 
as shown in Figure 7 and subtracted from all pixels in the 
ROI.

4. RANDOMNOISE 
JPL's Celestial Simulator facility was used to test the sun 
sensor prototype in a somewhat controlled area. The facility 
3-1567 
contains a Heliostat, which is simply a “sun tracker”. The 
heliostat consists of a large mirror sitting on a ’two-axis 
gimbal inside a dome attached to the facility. The sun is 
tracked using this gimbal system and the sun bundle is 
directed toward a fixed mirror located on the ceilinig of the 
facility. ‘The end result of all this is that there is a sun 
“bundle” inside the facility for about 4-6 hours around noon 
time (depending on the season). A picture of the heliostat is 
shown in Figure 9. 
Figure 9. The Heliostat at JF’L 
The sun sensor was placed under the heliostat for 
approximately 4000 seconds. If the heliostat was operating 
ideally (i.e., no drift), the sun bundle should not move and 
the centroids would remain constant. A single aperture in 
the mask was chosen from the image with coordinates 
(x,y)=(255,257). The x and y values of the centroids is 
shown as function of time in Figure 10. The standard 
deviation on the x coordinate is 0.23 pixel and the standard 
deviation on the y coordinate is 0.3 pixel.

Figure 10. The x and y values of one aperture centroid 
Assuming a stable sun bundle, the coordinates of this 
aperture are supposed to be constant. The behavior of the 
centroids, was unexpected. A closer examination of the 
heliostat facility revealed that the fault was in the tracking 
mirror motor. The sun sensor did not contribute to this 
unexpected behavior. Therefore it was concluded that this 
facility is not accurate enough to assess the noise of this sun 
sensor alver long periods. However, the x coordinate is 
constant for shorter time periods. For the first 100 samples, 
it is possible to assess the noise of the sun sensor. The 
standard deviation in this interval is 0.05 pixel. 
3-1568 
The actual distance between the aperture and the focal plane 
was 757.5 microns (this distance Will be discussed in the 
next section). The size of a CCD pixel is 9 microns. One 
pixel therefore has an angle equivalent to tan 
(9/757.5)=0.68”. The random noise on a single aperture is 
then 0.05x0.680=2 arc-minutes in each axis. This random 
noise is for a single aperture. Assuming that the 
measurements are independent, and the mask consists of, 
say, 15~15=225 apertures, then the accuracy will be 
improved by sqrt (225)=15 times. A noise estimate for this 
kind of sun sensor is then 2 arc-minute:s /15 = 8 arc-seconds. 
5.  CALJBRATIOI~ 
The calibration establishes the relationship between the 
position of the aperture centroids ancl the sun angles. For 
this purpose, the heliostat and a two a& gimbal was used. 
The sun bundle always comes from the top of the test room. 
The 2-axis gimbal then rotates though a large number of 
different angles and the aperture centroids are recorded. 
Based on all these measurements it is possible to derive the 
relationship between the aperture centroids and the sun 
angles. ,4 sketch of the 2-axis gimbal with the CCD camera 
is shown in Figure 11. The dashed lines indicate the two 
axis of rotation. 
Figure ll. A sketch of the 2-axis gimbal used to calibrate 
the sun sensor 
Only one single aperture centroid is investigated in this 
paper. The described procedure eventually has to be applied 
to all apertures on the mask. 
In the equations a right hand Cartesian coordinate system is 
used. The Gimbal is rotated around the x-axis and y-axis.

plane is 1. The projection is sketched in Figure 14. The

Figure 15. The position of the aperture centroid on the

In the calculations, it has been assumed that the distance 
between the aperture and the focal plane is 1. In the 
following, it is assumed that the distance is F, where the Unit 
of F is units of the pixel size (9 microns). The scenario is 
shown in Figure 16.

The coordinates of the sun on the focal plane as furiction of 
the gimbal angles can be written as: 
The focal plane may not be completely aligned with the sun 
coming fiom zenith. This could be caused by the sun not 
coming directly fkom zenith. It can also be caused by the 
gimbal zero angles not being aligned with the focal plane. In 
Figure 17 is shown the situation, where the focal plane is 
offset in two orthogonal axes.

The detector plane may also have been rotated around an 
axis orthogonal to the plane. This angle is called VI. This is 
sketch in Figure 18.

detector has been rotated an angle cp ortlnogonal to the image

Utilizing a normal two dimensional coordinate rotation 
results in the following the equations for the aperture 
centroid: 
Until now, it has been assumed that ihe aperture centroid 
intersects, the image detector in the coordinate (0,O). This 
will not he the case. The different apertures will be placed 
over different positions on the image detector. This is 
sketched in Figure 19. The intersection is called (&,yo).

intersection of the aperture centroid and the image detector

The new equations for the aperture cenlroid, as a function of 
the two gimbal angles will then be: 
During the data taking, 441 measurements were acquired, 
by sweeping both gimbal angles from -40" to 40" in steps of 
4". This vector set of angles is called a and 13. For each 
measurement, a set of observed (x,y) centroids on the focal 
plane was also observed. The four vectors are: 
There am only 6 unknowns. They are (io, Po, cp, xo, yo and F. 
We wand to find a solution that minimizes the squared 
3-1570 
distance between the calculated and measured aperture 
centroids. Therefore, we want to minimize the following: 
This can be solved utilizing Matlab or the Solver in Excel. 
The following optimal parameters were found: 
x0 = 255.17 F = 757.5,~ a0 = -1.95" 
yo = 256.37 = 0.269" Po = -0.51' (16) 
The calculated positions of the aperture centroids (in green) 
and the measured positions of the aperture centroids (in 
blue) are shown in Figure 20. A number of outliers have 
been identified as measurements where the distance between 
the calculated positions and measured positions are larger 
than the 3 0  value. These measurements have been discarded 
and are shown in red.

centroids (green) and the measured positions of the aperture 
centroids (blue). Outliers are shown in red 
The average error for the solution was found to be 0.37'. 
This number includes both random noise (0.033') and the 
uncertainties of the heliostat. It was found (Figure lo), that 
the heliostat error is on the order of 0.2-0.3 pixels - 0.17'. It 
is therefore expected that the accuracy of a single aperture is 
better than 0.3'. Also, utilizing several hundreds apertures, it 
is expected that the accuracy will improve with a factor of 
10 to 15. This means that the absolute accuracy for this type 
of sun sensor could be as low as a few arcminutes. 
6. FUTURE DIRECTION OF THE PROJECT 
At this point, the basic concept of the MEMS mask has been 
proven. In the next iteration of the MEMS mask, it will be 
coated to eliminate transmission through the substrate. Also, 
in the current setup a ND filter is used with a value of lo6. It 
is anticipated that this can be avoided by having a thin, non- 
coated layer of silicon inside the apertures, and allowing the 
silicon itself be the ND filter. 
The next phase of the project will focus on the development 
of a suitable focal plane detector. Presently the SBIG 
camera is utilized. In the next phase of the project, an entire 
camera on a chip is desired. This is currently not possible 
utilizing CCD chip technology, since it requires drivers and 
special voltages. However, Active Pixel Sensors (APS), a 
CMOS imaging focal plane technology, where it is possible 
to put all functions of a camera on a single chip, will be 
considered. Utilizing a camera on a chip, the sun sensor will 
only consist of a focal plane, a spacer and the MEMS mask. 
APS cameras on a chip with a 5-wire serial interface are 
available [lo]. The power consumption for a camera on a 
chip is 20 mW and packaging a MEMS mask and a focal 
plane together is expected to have a mass of less than 30 g. 
In the proposed system, the centroiding and conversion into 
sun angles functions will be done in the spacecraft flight 
computer. This is processor intensive. Basically, the 
computer has to read all pixels. It then has to compare all 
pixels to a threshold value. When a bright pixel is detected, 
it has to calculate the centroid. In Matlab, an non-optimized 
program takes approximately 1 million instructions to do 
this on an image. Utilizing a priory knowledge of the 
centroid positions can probably reduce the required 
processor load substantially, but still the entire image has to 
be loaded for each attitude update. Therefore another 
possibility will also be explored. On APS chips, it is 
possible to place additional logic on the focal plane. 
Experiments have been done to place the centroid 
calculation function on the chip in hardware [5 ] .  This means 
that the APS chip would only output aperture centroids. 
This would take a large burden off the spacecraft computer. 
7. SUMMARY 
A new type of sun sensor based on MEMS technology has 
been described in this paper. A tiny 7 mm x 7 mm mask is 
placed at a distance of 757 microns from a CCD chip. The 
mask is made out of a silicon wafer and consists of 
hundreds of apertures. The sun angle can be determined 
based on the position of the aperture centroids. 
The centroid of the apertures is calculated utilizing similar 
algorithms as utilized in star trackers. The projected noise of 
this system is 8 arcseconds. Calibrations show that the 
absolute accuracy will probably be on the order of a few 
arc-minutes. 
In the next phases of the project an APS camera on a chip 
will be utilized. It is anticipated that the mass of the sun 
sensor will be less than 30 grarns and the power 
consumption will be less than 20 mW.
