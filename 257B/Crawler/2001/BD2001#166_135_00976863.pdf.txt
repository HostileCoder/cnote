Abstract - The investigation of ocean surface waves and
current velocity using conventional synthetic aperture radar
techniques is not an easy task. Recently, airborne along-track
interferometric synthetic aperture radars (AT-INSARS) have
been developed, which employ two antennas, which are
physically separated along the platform tligbt path (along track)
direction. The two complex images received from two antennas
are combined interferometrically into a single complex ATI
image. The phase of tbe resulting complex image is proportional
to the radial component of the ocean surface scatterers velocity.
This velocity is the sum of the orbital motion of water particles
from the swell, phase velocity of the Bragg waves, and ocean
currents.
We have tested and investigated tbe ATI data which was
collected by PacRlm- hIRSAR experiment over the Kohala
coast, on the northwest shore of the big island of Hawaii. We
investigated the ocean wave and current features and have
retrieved dominant ocean wave spectrum. This research is a part
of the PACRIM-H ATI related research off Ulsan study area,
Korea.
I . INTRODUCTION
Microwave remote sensing of the ocean surface processes
using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is not only useful but
also of great interest due to the high spatial resolution and the
potential of almost instantaneous coverage of large areas. The
high azimuth resolution of SAR is achieved by synthesizing
over the finite integration the known phase history of the
backscattered signal that is Doppler-shifted due to the relative
motion between the imaged target and the radar antenna.
Range resolution is obtained by modulating the transmitted
signal [1][2]. However, the conventional SAR intensity image
over the ocean has some limitations in obtain quantitative
information such as current velocity and wave height.
Recently, airborne along-track interferometric synthetic
aperture radars (AT-INSARS) have been developed, which
have the potential to accurately observe ocean surface
currents and waves [3][4][5]. AT-INSARS employ two
antennas that are separated physically along the platform
flight path (along track) direction.
Goldstein and Zebker [3] and Goldstein et al. [4] have first
demonstrated the ability of the ATI to measure surface ocean
currents in San Francisco Bay, Mission Bay and San Diego
Bay. The fi-wther studies by Marom et al. [6][7] have
developed the method of applying ATI to directional and
power spectra of wave field measurements.
We have tested PacRim- I ATI data which was collected
off the Kohala coast, on the northwest shore of the big island
of Hawaii. These data were collected on 31 October 1996
during the NASA/JPL AIRSAR mission. We have
investigated the ocean wave and current features and have
retrieved wavelength and direction of dominant ocean wave
from the PacRim ATI test data. We also plan to apply the
technique to the analysis of the PacRim-11ATI data acquired
on September 30 2000 off Ulsan, Korea, when it becomes
available.
II. PRINCIPLESOF ATI
The schematic geometry of the along track interferometry
(ATI) is depicted schematically in Fig. 1. Here, x denotes the
coordinate in azimuth (along-track) direction and y the
coordinate in ground range (cross-track) direction. The flight
direction of the platform carrying the along track antennas in
the x direction and the platform velocity is F’. The two ATI
antennas are separated by a distance B in the along-track
direction. For a platform moving with the velocity V in the
azimuth direction x, the image of an identical surface area is
obtained by the two antennas separated by distance Ax= B
with the time interval At= B / 2V (this is related to ATI
operating mode; the atl antenna transmits radar signals and
both antemas receive the backscattered signals.). The phase
difference At between the return signals of the two ATI
antennas, which is due to the Doppler shift co~ and the time
interval At, is related to the measured radial component of
the surface velocity U, by

where k and A are the radar wave vector and wavelength
respectively. The projection of the range component of
surface scatterers velocity Ux on the line-of-sight direction is
U, = Ux sin O, 0 being the radar wave incidence angle. The
radial component of the surface scatterers velocity ( U, )
represents the vector sum of surface currents, orbital velocity
of the swell and phase velocity of the Bragg waves
[3][4][7][8][9].
Note that the ATI image represents a map of phase
difference ( A~ ), which can only vary in the range
–z < A~ < z . This may cause the ambiguous velocity
component for the time interval between observations At .
The maximum unambiguous velocity components for each
AIRSAR ATI system are given in Table 1.

III. DATAPROCESSINGAND RESULTS
We have tested ATI data which were collected by PacRim-
1 over the Kohala coast, on the northwest shore of the big
island of Hawaii. These data were collected on 31 October
1996. The flight direction was 360°, and aircraft speed was
approximately 2 16rn/s. We obtained some available ATI mode
datasets: laf_laa, lff_laa, and caf_caa. In this study, we have

used only the laf_laa dataset. The slant range image data are
interpolated to obtain ground range image with equal pixel
spacing in both directions, in order to facilitate the subsequent
Fourier analysis of the wave field (Fig. 2). The direct
computation of ocean velocity tlom the interferograrn has
some problems, because the interferogram is not filly
calibrated. In particular, the gee-location of the data assumes
that all the data reside at sea level, which will not be true for
land within the scene. Moreover, the motion-compensation
algorithms rely on a fixed elevation reference. Where the
scatterer elevation varies tlom that reference, a differential
phase was introduced into the interferogram. This should
have no effect on ocean scenes, but will introduce phase
variations following the topography of the land in a scene.
These phase variations should not be interpreted as arising
fi-omthe motion of scatterers over the land. There is unknown
global phase offset, in each interferogram. This propagates
into the velocity maps as an unknown velocity offset. These
phase biases can be removed by subtracting the non-zero
phase difference over land near the elevation reference in the
scene. Fig. 3 shows the velocity map which was calculated
from the corrected interferogram, and velocity profiles were
plotted in Fig. 4 along the a, b line indicated in Fig. 3. The

zero velocity over the land and negative velocity over the [11
ocean agree well with our expectation. The negative
velocities over the ocean correspond to the waves or currents
propagating toward the aircraft (that is, toward the shore). We
can also observe the well-developed ocean swell in Fig. 3. [21
Generally, the radial component of ocean scatterers velocity is
a superposition of the orbital motion of water particles from [3]
the swell, phase velocity of the Bragg waves, and ocean
currents. The phase velocity of Bragg wave and the ocean
current velocity are usually steady over large areas, whereas [4]
the orbital velocity of swell is composed of the higher spatial
frequencies and has zero mean value [7][8][9][1O]. These
allow us to obtain the wavelengths of dominant ocean waves [5]
and measure the currents velocity and phase velocity of Bragg
waves.
The two-dimensional wavenumber spectrum from the
subarea B (256pixelx256pixel; 2 176mx2 176m) marked in Fig. [6]
2 is given in Fig. 5. In this figure, we can clearly see two
wave systems. The two peaks in the spectram correspond to
wavelengths of 427m, 253m, and the propagating directions
of 75°, 125° respectively. The 180° direction ambiguity [7]
appears in this spectrum as wells. If we know the water depth
(h) of this area, the velocity of the swell can be obtained using
the linear dispersion relation
f
obtain the wavelength and propagating direction of the
dominant swell tiom the two-dimensional spectrum.
Estimation of the currents and Bragg wave velocity also
appears to be possible using ATI data by averaging procedure.
As for the PacRim-11ATI data, we are still waiting.

where, g is the gravitational acceleration, and k is the
wavenumber of the swell.
In other case, we can effectively remove the ocean wave
information by averaging spatially over areas larger than the
ocean wavelengths, which eliminates the contribution of the
orbital velocity of swell, and left only the ocean currents and
Bragg wave information. The projection of the radial
component of averaging velocity on the horizontal direction is
the final velocity of the Bragg wave and ocean currents.
