PET data is proposed and applied to measured data in order to 
simulate repeated experiments. An elliptical phantom with two 
hot spheres (1.2 cm and 2.2 cm diameter) in a warm background 
was scanned in a GE Advance PET system. The sphere to 
background ratio was 3.3:1. Randoms, scatter, attenuation and 
dead time corrections were applied to the sinogram data. The 
method was validated using the Student’s t- and F- statistical 
tests. Validation tests indicate that applying the bootstrap 
method to the pre-corrected PET data preserved the statistical 
characteristics of the images. The quality of image 
reconstruction of both measured data and resampled data were 
tested using the Channelized Hotelling Observer (CHO). Two 
reconstruction methods, filtered backprojection (FBP) and 
penalized maximum likelihood using space-alternating 
generalized EM (PML-SAGE), were compared. In the initial 
study, detectabilities of FBP were higher than the ones of PML-
SAGE for the small sphere detection, while detectabilities of 
PML-SAGE were higher than the ones of FBP for the big sphere 
detection. Detectabilities for resampled data appears higher than 
those for experiment data; the number of tested resampled data 
was 100, and 20 for experiment data. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
he performance of the Channelized Hotelling Observer 
(CHO) has been shown to correlate well with human 
observer performance [1], [5]. The CHO offers an alternative 
to human observer studies in the assessment of image quality 
and system performance. In order to perform a high quality 
numerical observer study, many realizations of the same 
image set are required [6]. However it is often difficult and 
time-consuming to acquire many data sets by either Monte 
Carlo simulations or experiments. Bootstrap resampling can 
be a valuable tool to simulate repeated experiments. Our

group has previously investigated a bootstrap approach for 
list-mode data and sinograms which are raw and uncorrected 
for effects such as attenuation, dead time, and randoms [2]. 
The basic idea of resampling in [2] was that a sequence of 
random drawings is made from a Poisson distribution with 
parameter equal to each data point. 
In this work, we propose a bootstrap resampling method 
that can be used for pre-corrected PET data. Statistical tests 
were applied to the resampled data sets to validate the basic 
approach. The CHO study was then used to compare the 
detectability between the filtered backprojection (FBP) and 
the penalized maximum-likelihood using space-alternating 
generalized EM (PML-SAGE) reconstructions of both the 
measured data sets and the resampled data sets.  
II. METHODS 
A. Experiment 
An elliptical phantom containing two hot spheres of 
different size was scanned in the GE Advance PET system. 
The major axis of the inner radius of the elliptical phantom 
was 15cm, and the minor axis 11cm. The inner diameter of 
each sphere was determined from the volume calculated by 
taking the difference in the mass of the spheres filled with 
water and with air, and dividing by the density of the water.  
The calculated inner diameter of the spheres was 2.2cm 
and 1.2cm respectively. The spheres were placed as shown in 
Fig. 1. The spheres were not in the same transaxial plane.  
The spheres and the elliptical phantom were filled with F-18 
mixed in water. The approximate activity concentration ratio 
of the spheres to the warm background was 3.3:1.  
Twenty dynamic emission scans were acquired and binned 
into 20 data sets, each consisting of 35 2D sinograms. Each

 scan contained 10 million counts.  Random corrections were 
done on-the-fly during the event acquisition. Scatter, 
attenuation and dead time corrections were done during 
binning into sinograms. A 15-min transmission scan was 
acquired for attenuation correction.  
B. Bootstrap Resampling 
Since the distribution of the pre-corrected data is not 
Poisson and the sinogram has negative numbers in the 
background due to the randoms correction, the bootstrap 
method we previously developed in [2] (i.e., drawing random 
numbers from Poisson distribution with parameter equal to 
each sinogram bin) cannot be applied.  
The bootstrap method we propose for the pre-corrected PET 
data creates a resampled data set by picking the data value for 
each DA (distance-angle) bin randomly from the 
corresponding bin in the existing experimentally acquired 
sinograms. That is, to create n resampled sinograms from m 
experimental data sets, a sequence of n drawings 
), . . . ,,( 21
j
n
jj ddd  for each bin j is made from the uniform 
distribution with the closed interval [0, m-1]. In this way, we 
can perform bootstrap resampling without estimating the 
underlying probability distribution of the data.  For our study, 
n = 100 resampled data sets were derived from m = 20 scans 
for each of two classes, simulated tumor (sphere) present and 
tumor absent.  
C. Image Reconstruction 
FBP and PML-SAGE methods were used for 2D 
reconstruction of each data set. The constrained least-squares 
(CLS) filter was used for FBP to match the resolution 
between FBP and penalized-likelihood reconstructions [4]. 
The cutoff parameter used for the filter was 62−=β .  
The number of iterations for PML-SAGE was ten, and a 
FBP reconstructed image was used as an initial estimate to 
expedite convergence. The penalty parameter used was 
62−=β , the same number used for FBP to roughly match the 
resolution between the two methods. 
D. Statistical Validation 
The regions-of-interest (ROIs) were defined as two 5x5 
pixel arrays, one being in the hot activity area and the other in 
the warm background. One set of 20 images from the 
experiment data and five sets of 20 images from the bootstrap 
resampled data were used for the statistical tests. Mean 
counts/pixel of the ROI of each image was computed, and 
then their mean and variance were computed for each 20 
image set. The FBP reconstruction algorithm was used for 
both the experiment data and the resampled data.  
The Student’s t-test and F-test were used to test if the 
means and variances of the experiment data and the 
resampled data were significantly different from each other. 
In both tests, the significance level α was set at 0.05. The t 
test statistic and F test statistic were calculated by (1) and (2) 
respectively.

For the significance level 0.05 and the degrees of freedom, 
the critical values were determined, and the null hypothesis 
was accepted if each test statistic is less than the critical 
value. 
E. Numerical Observer Study 
The CHO was implemented based on the work of Hutton 
and Strickland [3]. Nine radially symmetric channels were 
used in the spatial frequency domain: 8 channels between 0 
and 0.4 in the normalized spatial frequency domain plus one 
channel for the rest of the region (Fig. 2). The detectability, as 
a figure of merit of the receiver-operating-characteristic 
(ROC) analysis, was calculated for each image set 
reconstructed by FBP and PML-SAGE to quantify the 
algorithm performance. The detectability is defined as, 
 
                  
 
da =
λ1 − λ0
1
2
(σ1
2 + σ0
2)
                         (3)  
 
where λ0 and λ1 are the CHO test statistics of tumor absent 
and tumor present groups, and σ0 and σ1 are variances of  
CHO test statistics for each group. A higher detectability 
indicates that two groups (tumor absent and tumor present) 
are well separated by the system and CHO test statistics of 
each group are tightly clustered.  
 Since estimating the average covariance matrix from the 
feature vector of the two classes is the part of the linear 
Hotelling discriminant, condition numbers were computed to 
determine if the average covariance matrix was well-
conditioned. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 The CHO was applied to both 20 experiment data and 100 
bootstrap resampled data to compute detectabilities.

Table II shows the result of F-tests. One out of five sets of 
20 images was rejected for foreground ROIs and Two were 
rejected for background ROIs at the significance level 0.05. 
Note that all the variances of the resampled data are smaller 
than the variances of the experiment data.  
Fig. 3 and 4 show examples of reconstructed images using 
both FBP and PML-SAGE method described as in the 
Section II. Big spheres are highly visible while small spheres 
almost invisible to untrained human observers.

Table III and Table IV show detectabilities computed by 
using the CHO. Condition numbers of the average covariance 
matrix are relatively small, so this indicates that the 
estimation of the average covariance matrix from feature 
vectors extracted was well-conditioned. Fig. 5. show the 
distributions of test statistics of two classes. 
Detectabilities of FBP were higher than those of PML-
SAGE for both measured data and resampled data in the small 
sphere (1.2 cm diam.) detection (Table III), while 
detectabilities of PML-SAGE were higher than those of FBP 
in the big sphere (2.2 cm diam.) detection on the other hand 
(Table IV). The time spent for PML-SAGE reconstruction of 
one image with FBP image as an initial estimate was 
approximately 40 sec as compared to about 1 sec for FBP. 
Detectabilities of resampled data appeared higher than 
those of experiment data in all four cases, i.e. for both FBP 
and PML-SAGE in either small sphere case and big sphere 
case (Table III and IV). 
IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS 
We have presented a bootstrap resampling method for pre-
corrected PET data.  
The t-Test results showed that there is no statistically 
significant difference between the means of bootstrap 
resampled data and of repeated experimental acquisitions 
1446
 (Table I). The F-test results, however, showed that there 
might be some statistical differences between the variances of 
bootstrap resampled data and of repeated experimental 
acquisitions, since there was one rejection of the null 
hypothesis for the foreground ROI analysis and two rejections 
for the background ROI.  
These results are somewhat expected since there was a 
change in the randoms count rate over the duration of 20 
repeated data acquisitions in the GE Advance PET system. 
Our bootstrap resampling method, however, randomly mixes 
bins in the sinograms, which results in minimization of the 
variance. Future work will include a gated PET acquisition to 
solve this problem as well as further statistical testing of the 
bootstrap approach with simulation data. 
Detectabilities of resampled data appeared higher than 
those of experiment data in all four cases (Table III and IV). 
There might be two reasons: 1) more reliable estimation of 
the covariance matrix for the CHO by increasing sample size, 
and 2) reducing the effect of the randoms rate changes by 
bootstrap resampling also reduced the noise level in the data. 
Sphere detectabilities from FBP images appear higher than 
those of PML-SAGE for both measured data and resampled 
data for the 1.2 cm diam. sphere (Table III), while 
detectabilities of PML-SAGE were higher than FBP for the 
2.2cm diam. sphere (Table IV). We were not able to be 
conclusive about comparisons with these preliminary results. 
With our planned repeated studies, we will obtain a more 
precise result and estimate the statistical significance of any 
detectability differences.
