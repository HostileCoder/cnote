Abstract-A long-duration test of the Deep Space 1 (DS1) 
spare flight thruster (FT2) is presently being conducted. To 
date, the thruster has accumulated over 6700 hours d 
operation. Pdormance data-such as thrust, specific 
impulse and efficiency+wer the full 0.5 to 2.3 kW 
throttling range are presented. Comparison of FT2 with the 
performance of the engineering model thruster 2 (EMT2) 
during an 8.2 khr test shows a transient, lasting for about 
3000 hours, during which the discharge chamber efEciency 
decreases for both thrusters. After the initial transient, the 
performance of both thrusters at full power is comparable 
with the exception of the electron backstreaming limit, 
which is 6 V lower for FT2. Degradation of electrical 
isolation for neutralizer and for discharge cathode 
components has occurred during FT2 testing; although this 
has made starting the thruster slightly more difficult, it is 
not expected to cause thruster failure.

1. INTRODUCTION 
NASA’s 30 cm diameter xenon ion thruster technology is 
being validated for use in planetary missions by the NASA 
Solar Electric Propulsion Technology Application 
Readiness (NSTAR) program. This program is designed to 
develop the industrial capability to produce flight engine, 
power processor, and propelIant feed system hardware and 
demonstrate that the technology is mature enough for flight 
applications. One of the goals of the program is to provide 
flight managers with suflicient information on performance, 
thruster life and spacecraft interactions to give them the 
confidence to use the technology. 
The technology validation includes a number of ground 
tests designed to demonstrate engine perfbrmance over the 
required throttling range, characterizing the engine and 
plume interactions with the s p a c e d ,  and understanding 
the dominant failure modes. The program includes 4 long- 
duration ground based tests and in-flight validation of the 
xenon ion thruster technology on the Deep Space 1 @S1) 
spacecraft. 
During the first long-duration ground test, 2000 hours [l] 
of operation were accumulated at the NSTAR full power 
point (2.3 kW thruster power). During this test several 
potential failure modes were identified and subsequently 
studied in shorter duration tests. Design changes, made as 
a result of this work, were then validated in a 1000-hour 
wear test at full power [2]. Subsequent to this test, an 
engineering model thruster, designated EMT2, was tested 
for 8200 hours at the NSTAR full power point [3,4]: 
During the execution of this test, two flight thrusters were 
fabricated by Hughes Electron Dynamics Division; short 
duration acceptance and qualification testing were 
subsequently performed on these thrusters [5,6]. 
Mer qualifcation testing, one of the flight thrusters, 
designated FT1, was integrated onto the DS1 spacecraft. 
On October 24, 1998 the DS1 spacecraft was launched. 
Operation of FT1 began in November 1998; after thrusting 
for over 1800 hours and processing 11.8 kg of xenon, the 
DS1 spacecraft performed a flyby of asteroid 9969 Braille 
on July 28, 1999. Processing an additional 62 kg of xenon 
with FT1 is planned, so that DS 1 can flyby comet Wilson- 
Harrington and comet Borrelly in January 2001 and 
September 2001, respectively. A discussion of the 
’ 0-7803-5846-5/00/$10.00  2000 IEEE 
99 
operation and performance of FTl on the DS 1 spacecraft is 
given in Ref. [7]. 
Modifications to the EMT design, due to thermal and 
structural considerations, were incorporated into the flight 
thrusters [5 ] .  Although these modifications were not 
expected to cause signifcant change in thruster 
performance, ground testing of the spare flight thruster, 
designated FT2, was initiated before the launch of DS1. 
Initial testing was done to determine if there were any 
significant problems with the flight thruster design prior to 
the launch of DSl. Ground testing of FT2 began on 
October 5, 1998 and 412 problem fixe hours of operation 
were accumulated before the DS1 launch. Life testing af 
FT2 has continued since the DS1 launch to identify 
potential problems before they occur on DS1 and to further 
study known thruster wear out modes. Most of the testing 
through the first 4937 hours was conducted at the NSTAR 
full power point. Since then the thruster has been operated 
at 1.5 kW thruster power. 
2. TEST PLAN 
A major objective of the FT2 test is processing 125 kg af 
xenon, which is 150% of the NSTAR thruster design life. 
Based on the condition of EMT2 &er processing 88 kg af 
xenon at full power [4], it is thought that FT2 is capable af 
demonstrating the additional life. The larger throughput per 
thruster is required to enable ambitious solar system 
exploration missions. Proposed missions include Europa 
Lander, Neptune Orbiter, Saturn Ring Explorer, Venus 
Sample Return and Comet Nucleus Sample Return. 
Many of these missions require throttling the thruster over 
a range of 0.5 to 2.3 kW, so it is desirable to conduct 
testing at throttled operating conditions. During a typical 
mission, the thruster power is throttled in small increments 
to use the maximum available solar power. However, to 
facilitate comparison of experimental data with thruster 
performance models, FT2 testing will be conducted with 
relatively long periods of operation at chosen power levels. 
Testing at throttled conditions is also done to study 
thruster wear characteristics, and to identifj potential Mure 
modes or operational difficulties not observed during full 
power testing. 
In addition to normal operation, short duration throttling 
tests are conducted at intervals. During these tests, thruster 
performance is measured at six points covering the 0.5 to 
2.3 kW operating range. 
Testing of FT2 prior to the DS1 launch was conducted at 
1.96 kW, which was the maximum power available f a  
thruster operation on DS1. Shortly after the DS1 launch, at 
448 hours, the throttle level was increased to 2.3 kW and 
operation at this level continued until 4937 hours. At that 
point 50 kg of xenon had been processed by FT2. The 
thruster was then throttled to 1.5 kW and has operated at 
this level since. The present plan is to operate at 1.5 kW 
for the next 40 kg (-6,000 hours at 1.5 kW). Then 
resumption of full power operation, to process an additional 
40 kg of xenon by the end of calendar year 2000, is 
planned. 
If additional funding were available, it would be desirable 
to execute additional FT2 testing near the minimum power 
level (somewhere between 0.5 and 0.8 kW) for an extended 
period. As with the other power levels, this testing would 
be done to gain additional insight into thruster wear 
mechanisms as well as identi@ failure modes or operational 
d8iculties. 
3. THRUSTER 
A schematic diagram of the 30-cm-diameter NSTAR flight 
thruster is shown in Figure 1. The thruster is comprised a€ 
four major components; these are the discharge cathode, the 
discharge chamber, the ion optics and the neutralizer 
cathode. The thruster operates by ionizing xenon propellant 
in the discharge chamber and then accelerating the positive 
ions through the ion optics system. The neutralizer cathode 
supplies electrons to charge neutralize the ion beam. 
Laboratory power supplies are being used for FT2 testing. 
These supplies have similar capabilities to those used on 
the DS1 spacecraft, however, there are some differences 
which will be noted. Xenon feed lines, shown in Figure 1, 
are at facility ground potential for FT2 testing and are at 
s p a c e d  ground potential on DS1. The thruster is 
electrically isolated fiom the feed lines by a ceramic 
propellant isolator in each line. The thruster and power 
supplies are electically isolated fiom facility ground for 
FT2 testing and are isolated fiom spacecraft ground on 
DS1. The thruster reference potential, for both FT2 in 
ground testing and FTl on DS1, is neutralizer common. 
The thruster start sequence begins by flowing xenon 
propellant at the full power setpoint values through each a€ 
the three feed lines. Once steady flow has been established, 
the current regulated neutralizer heater and discharge 
cathode heater supplies are both commanded to 8.5 A. 
After 210 seconds of heating, the current regulated 
neutralizer keeper supply (35 V open circuit) is commanded 
to 2 A and is enabled. The neutralizer hollow cathode is 
enclosed inside the neutralizer keeper electrode which has 
an orifice at the downstream end to allow xenon (and 
plasma when the neutralizer is ignited) to flow away limn 
the neutralizer. On DSl a 650 V, 10 ps pulse supply, with 
a loHz repetition rate, is also turned on to facilitate 
striking an arc between the neutralizer hollow cathode and 
the neutralizer keeper, For FT2 testing a pulse supply a€ 
the same design is available. Once the neutralizer discharge 
is ignited, the neutralizer heater and the pulse start supply 
are both turned off and the neutralizer operates in a self- 
heating mode. The plasma produced by the neutralizer 
bridges the gap between the neutralizer hollow cathode and 
the neutralizer keeper electrode allowing electrons to flow 
to the neutralizer keeper. During normal thruster operation, 
the neutralizer plasma also bridges the gap between the 
neutralizer and the ion beam allowing charge neutralizing 
electrons to flow into the positive ion beam.

Figure 1 Schematic of FT2 
On DS1, a€ter the neutralizer is started, the current 
regulated discharge supply (35 V open circuit) is 
commanded to 4 A and is enabled. A pulse start supply, 
similar to the neutralizer pulse supply, is used to apply a 
650 V pulse between the anode and discharge cathode. The 
discharge cathode keeper is connected to the anode through 
a 1 kQ resistor and the arc discharge is started between the 
discharge hollow cathode and the discharge cathode keeper. 
Once the discharge is started the cathode heater and the 
pulse start supply are turned off and the discharge cathode 
operates in a self-heating mode. 
For FT2 testing, the discharge power supply is used to 
operate both the cathode heater and the discharge. Mer the 
neutralizer is started, the current regulated discharge supply 
is turned OK Then a relay is enabled to switch the power 
supply fiom the cathode heater to the anode. Then the 
discharge supply (50 V open circuit) is commanded to 4 A 
and it is enabled. In the FT2 test the anode is also 
connected to the discharge cathode keeper through a 1 kQ 
resistor so that the discharge can be started between the 
discharge hollow cathode and the discharge keeper. If the 
discharge does not ignite using the discharge supply, a 
250 V start supply can be used for FT2. 
During normal thruster operation, xenon-which is fed into 
the spun titanium discharge chamber (anode) through the 
main flow line and through the discharge cathode flow 
line-is ionized by energetic electrons supplied by the 
discharge cathode. To improve the ionization efficiency cf 
the discharge chamber, a magnetic field provided by three 
rings of rare-earth permanent magnets is used. The back 
magnet ring is mounted behind the discharge chamber 
cathode. The middle ring is attached at the upstream end cf 
the cylindrical section of the discharge chamber. The fimt 
magnet ring is attached near the ion optics system. 
Once positive xenon ions are being produced in the 
discharge chamber, the voltage regulated beam and 
accelerator supplies are tumed on to set up an electric field 
in the two-grid molybdenum ion accelerator system (or ion 
optics system) attached to the downstream end of the 
discharge chamber. The upstream grid (called the screen 
grid) is connected electrically to discharge cathode 
common. The voltage regulated beam supply is used to 
bias the discharge chamber as much as 1100 V above 
neutralizer common during normal thruster operation. 
Positive xenon ions are accelerated toward and focused 
through apertures in the downstream grid (called the 
accelerator grid). The accelerator grid is typically biased 
150 to 250V negative of neutralizer common to keep 
beam-neutralizing electrons fiom flowing upstream through 
the ion optics into the discharge chamber. To prevent 
beam-neutralizing electrons fiom reaching high voltage 
exterior surfaces, the discharge chamber is enclosed in a 
perforated plasma screen. The plasma screen is tied to 
facility ground in ground based testing and is tied to 
s p a c e d  common in flight. For the ground test, the 
thruster is mounted to a holding fixture (at facility ground 
potential) with three equally spaced gimbal pads, while on 
the spacecraft it is mounted on a gimbal ring (tied to 
s p a c e d  ground). 
The flight thrusters incorporate several minor design 
changes which are not included in the EMT2 design [5 ] .  In 
the EMT2 design the discharge chamber is fabricated from 
spun aluminum and titanium parts, while the flight design 
uses titanium for the entire discharge chamber. In addition, 
the gimbal brackets used to attach the thruster to the 
101 
spacecraft have been changed fiom stainless steel in EMT2 
to titanium and some of the discharge chamber components 
have lightening holes in the flight design. Grit-blasted wire 
mesh, which covers the upstream conical portion of the 
discharge chamber for improved sputter containment in 
EMT2, has been extended to cover the downstream portion 
as well in the flight design. Many of the components in the 
flight thruster are grit blasted to improve thermal radiation 
capability compared to EMT2. The flight design also uses 
magnets which have been thermally stabilized at a higher 
temperature than those used in EMT2. In EMT2 the main 
cathode keeper assembly is attached to the discharge 
chamber, while the flight design uses a brazed cathode 
keeper assembly. These design changes were validated by 
analysis or short duration tests and were not expected to 
have a negative impact on engine performance or wear 
characteristics. 
4. THROTTLE TABLE 
Table 1 shows the set points for each of the seven 
independent operating parameters for the NSTAR thruster. 
Additional columns showing the NSTAR throttle level 
designation and the nominal thruster power are also 
included. The power level designation is given as a TH 
level, ranging from T H O  for 0.5 kW to TH15 for 2.3 kW. 
The propellant exhaust velocity is controlled by the beam 
voltage. The beam current is proportional to the rate at 
which propellant mass is extracted and accelerated from the 
thruster. The discharge power supply current set point is 
controlled to produce the ions required to provide the 
desired beam current. The accelerator grid voltage is set 
negative enough to prevent electron backstreaming. The 
neutralizer keeper current is set to ensure that the neutralizer 
does not extinguish during recycle events. Occasionally an 
arc occurs between high voltage surfaces and ground or 
between the screen and accelerator grids. A recycle event is 
said to occur when the beam and accelerator grid power 
supplies are commanded off briefly, in response to the 
overcurrent caused by the arc, and then turned back on after 
the arc has extinguished. 
The main flow and discharge cathode flow rates are set to 
maintain reasonable discharge chamber performance. If the 
flow rate is decreased while the beam current is held 
constant, the discharge power-required to produce the 
ions needed for the ion beam-increases. If the flow rate is 
increased while the beam current is held constant, the 
amount of neutral propellant leaking through the grids 
increases. The neutral gas escaping fiom the thruster is not 
accelerated to high velocity and does not contribute 
significantly to the thrust. The flow rates are set to a level 
where the trade between neutral propellant loss and 
discharge power consumption results in near optimal 
discharge chamber performance. 
It is desirable to minimize the neutralizer flow rate because 
the propellant expended through the neutralizer is not used 
to produce thrust. The neutralizer flow is used to produce a 
low impedance plasma bridge between the neutralizer and 
the ion beam. If the flow is reduced too much, the 
impedance becomes large and the chargeneutralizing 
electrons have difficulty reaching the beam. Typically, large 
voltage oscillations occur when this happens and these 
oscillations can result in damage to the neutralizer. These 
oscillations are characteristic of what is referred to as plume 
mode operation. The neutralizer flow rates are set to 
minimize propellant loss while maintaining enough margin 
to prevent plume mode operation. 
5. VACUUM FACILITY 
The long-duration test of FT2 is being conducted in a 3-m- 
diameter by 10-m-long vacuum chamber pumped by three 
1.2-m-diameter CVI cryopumps with a combined pumping 
speed of 45-50 kL/s on xenon. In addition, three xenon 
cryopumps [SI consisting of 0.7 m2 pure aluminum panels 
Table 1. NSTAR Thruster Throttle Table 
102 
mounted on Cryomech AL200 coldheads, each with a 
xenon pumping speed of 18 kL/s, are used for a total xenon 
pumping speed of 100 kL/s. This pumping system 
provides a base pressure of lx105 Pa (lxlo-’ Torr) and less 
than 5x10-“ Pa ( 4 ~ 1 0 - ~  Torr) at the 111 power flow rates. 
After the six pumps accumulate a total of about 10 kg af 
xenon, the pumping surfaces must be regenerated. This 
exposes the engine to an atmosphere composed primarily d 
xenon at a pressure of about 4000 Pa (30 Torr). The 
cathodes are purged with xenon during these exposures and 
are conditioned (heated to remove contaminants) after the 
subsequent pumpdown to high vacuum. After the pump 
regeneration, there is usually a temporary increase in 
neutralizer keeper voltage and in the magnitude af 
neutralizer common voltage with respect to facility ground. 
To reduce the amount of facility material backsputtered 
onto the thruster, the walls and rear of the vacuum chamber 
are lined with graphite panels. The backsputtered 
deposition rate is monitored with a quartz crystal 
microbalance located next to the engine in the plane of the 
grids. At full power the backsputter rate is 
0.16 mg/cm2/khr or 0.7 pm/khr. 
The propellant feed system has two Unit Instruments mass 
flow meters in each of the main, cathode and neutralizer 
flow lines. All six of these meters are mounted on a 
temperature controlled plate inside a thermally insulated 
box. The downstream flow meter in each line is used to 
measure the flow rate to an accuracy of h1 percent. The 
upstream flow meters are used as flow controllers. The 
output signal &om each controller is used to actuate a 
solenoid valve which maintains the flow rate at the setpoint 
in each line. The solenoid valves are mounted on a second 
temperature controlled plate which is installed in an 
evacuated box. The feed system lines fiom the evacuated 
box through the vacuum chamber walls to the thrust stand 
are all welded to eliminate air leaks into the low pressure 
part of the flow system. At the thrust stand, located inside 
the vacuum chamber, resistoflex fittings are used to connect 
the feed lines to the thruster. The flow meters are calibrated 
on xenon, after each cryopump regeneration. 
The laboratory power supplies used to run the thruster 
during this test are the same ones used for the 1,000 hour 
test [2] and for the last 5,200 hours of the 8,200 hour 
test [4]. A computer data acquisition and control system is 
used to monitor facility and engine conditions as well as 
control the power supplies. Engine electrical parameters are 
measured to within *0.5 percent using precision shunts and 
voltage dividers which are calibrated during each cryopump 
regeneration. The system samples and stores data at -5 
second intervals. It is programmed to shut down the 
thruster if facility problems occur or out-of-tolerance 
conditions on certain engine parameters occur. This allows 
the system to be operated in unattended mode. 
At present, work is being conducted to allow unattended 
operation of the thruster with the DSl spare flight power 
processing unit (PPU). The PPU will be operated in a 
vacuum facility located adjacent to the thruster chamber. 
The PPU is mounted on a temperature controlled plate and 
was recently used to run the thruster during attended, short 
duration testing. Installation of interlocks that will shut 
down the thruster and PPU if facility problems are detected 
is nearing completion. During preparation of the PPU 
facility, the PPU has been used for grid clear testing to 
support the DS1 mission [9]. 
6. DIAGNOSTICS EQUIPMENT 
A thrust vector probe [ 101 used to monitor the thrust vector 
is located 5.8 m downstream of the thruster. The probe 
consists of 16 horizontal and 16 vertical 9-mm-diameter by 
1.2-m-long graphite rods configured in a square array. The 
rods are evenly spaced 7 cm apart and are biased 20 V 
negative of facility ground to repel electrons. The current to 
each rod represents the integral across the beam current 
density distribution at a given location. The currents to the 
vertical or horizontal rods can be fit with gaussian 
distributions. The intersection of the centriods of these 
distributions defines the location of the thrust vector. 
An EXB probe, mounted 6 m downstream of the thruster, 
is used to measure the double-to-single ion current ratio. 
The probe collimator samples ions emitted fiom a 
rectangular strip 1.8 cm wide in one direction and 
extending across the entire diameter of the thruster in the 
other direction. The probe is mounted on a turntable. By 
adjusting the turntable the cross-section of the thruster hm 
which ions are sampled can be varied. The probe was 
aligned with the thruster operating and was pointed in the 
direction which yielded the maximum single ion current. 
7. TEST RESULTS 
Testing of FT2 is being conducted to measure thruster 
performance changes over the life of the thruster and idenm 
potential failure modes. Among the data presented are 
throttling test data, over the full 0.5 to 2.3 kW range. 
Also, comparison of FT2 performance against that of the 
engineering model thruster, EMT2, during the 8200 hour 
life test is described. Additional details are presented in 
Ref. [l 13. A decrease in the electrical isolation between 
discharge cathode and neutralizer cathode components has 
occurred during FT2 testing; the impact on thruster 
performance and life is discussed. 
Throttling Test Results 
Results of throttling tests over the power range (0.5 kW to 
2.3 kW thruster power) are shown in Figures 2, 3 and 4. 
These data are also presented in Table 2. Figure 2 shows 
the thrust as a function of thruster power at several times 
during the test. The thrust is primarily a function of beam 
current (proportional to mass flow rate) and the square root 
of the beam voltage (proportional to ion speed). Since both 
beam current and beam voltage are set to fvred values, the 
thrust level is also fixed. Variations in thruster power 
required to produce a given thrust are due primarily to 
changes in the discharge power as the thruster wears. The 
beam voltage is 1100 V at all but the lowest power point 
at which it is 650 V.

Figure 3 FT2 Specific Impulse vs Power 
The specific impulse variation with thruster power is 
shown in Figure 3. Specific impulse is defined as the thrust 
divided by the propellant weight flow rate at the surface d 
the earth. At the minimum power point the specific 
impulse is low primarily because the beam voltage is low 
(650 V compared to 1100 V at all other operating 
conditions). At the power levels between 0.5 and 1.5 kW 
the specific impulse is low because the neutralizer 
flow-which is not accelerated and represents a cold flow 
2.0 2.5 
loss-is a larger fraction of the total flow rate than at power 
levels above 1.5 kW. The ratio of neutralizer flow to total 
propellant flow decreases as the power level increases 
resulting in higher specific impulse. 
Thruster efficiency is plotted as a function of thruster power 
in Figure 4. Thruster efficiency is defined as the ratio d 
power converted into thrust producing propellant directed 
kinetic energy to the total power consumed by the thruster.

The efficiency decreases with decreasing power primarily 
because of the cold flow loss through the neutralizer. Over FT2/EMT2 Comvarison 
Y 
time the efficiency tends to decrease slightly as the power 
required to produce ions in the discharge chamber 
increases. 
A set of plots C0mp-g the performance Of FT2 against 
that of EMT2 is shown in Figures 5-18. In each of these 
plots the vertical dashed lines at 448 hours and at 4937

changed. The TH level for FT2 during each time interval 
is shown on each plot; all of the EMT2 data in these plots 
is at full power (TH15).

Approximately every 50 to 200 hours a set cf 
measurements are made to characterize the performance cf 
the ion optics system. Three key parameters for the ion 
optics system are electron backstreaming limit, perveance 
margin and screen grid transparency to ions. As previously 
stated, the ion optics is used to extract and accelerate the 
ions produced in the discharge chamber while keeping 
beam neutralizing electrons from backstreaming into the 
discharge chamber. Electron backstreaming occurs when the 
potential at the center of accelerator grid apertures is 
insufficiently negative to prevent electrons f?om traveling 
upstream into the discharge chamber. The potential in the 
accelerator grid holes is dependent on a number of variables 
including: the electric field between the grids, the voltage 
applied to the accelerator grid, the ion current extracted 
through the aperture, and the accelerator grid aperture 
diameter. Electron backstreaming is most likely to occur 
near the center of the thruster where the maximum beam 
current density is extracted. 
The electron backstreaming limit is determined by 
increasing the accelerator grid voltage until the discharge 
loss begins to decrease. Discharge loss is the ratio af 
energy cost of producing beam ions to the extracted beam 
current. For the beam power supply backstreaming 
electrons are indistinguishable from positive ions being 
accelerated from the discharge chamber. When 
backstreaming occurs the positive ion current extracted 
from the discharge chamber must decrease to maintain the 
beam current at the setpoint. As a result, fewer ions are 
produced in the discharge chamber and the discharge loss 
decreases. For the data presented here, the electron 
backstreaming limit is defined as the accelerator grid 
voltage at which the discharge loss decreases by 1%. 
A comparison of electron backstreaming limit for FT2 and 
EMT2 is shown in Figure 5 .  A large shift in the electron 
backstreaming limit, from -148.2 V to -139.6 V, occurred 
over the first 124 hours of FT2 testing. After that, the 
electron backstreaming is less negative at TH12 for FT2 
than at TH15 for EMT2. During full power operation, the 
electron backstreaming for FT2 remained about 6 V more 
negative than that for EMT2. The long term changes in 
electron backstreaming limit are thought to be due 
primarily to accelerator grid aperture enlargement caused by 
ion sputtering; however, the shift during the first 124 hours 
of FT2 testing is thought to be due to an increase in grid 
spacing. An increase in the grid gap reduces the electric 
field between the grids, requiring a less negative accelerator 
grid potential to prevent electron backstreaming. It is also 
noted that accelerator grid aperture size would have to 
decrease to account for the shift which is considered 
unlikely. 
Since thruster operation at THS began at 4937 hours, the 
electron backstreaming limit has remained essentially 
constant. This suggests that the accelerator grid apertures 
are not enlarging near the center of the grid where 
backstreaming is most likely to occur. This is consistent 
with an NSTAR project assumption that operation at lower 
power levels is more benign in terms of erosion of the ion 
optics system. 
The jumps in electron backstreaming limit when power 
level is changed are due to differences in beam current 
extracted through ion optics apertures. Positive space- 
charge causes the potential in the accelerator grid apertures 
to increase as the beam current increases; therefore, a more 
negative accelerator grid voltage is required to prevent 
electron backstreaming at higher power levels where more 
beam current is extracted. 
The 6 V difference in electron backstreaming limit between 
FT2 and EMT2 operating at full power is thought to be 
due to a slight di€ference in the gap between the grids. 
Decreasing the spacing between the grids results in a 
stronger intra-grid electric field. This results in a higher 
potential in the accelerator grid aperture, requiring a more 
negative accelerator grid voltage to prevent electron 
backstreaming. In Ref [ l l ]  it was estimated that the 6 V 
lower electron backstreaming limit for FT2 could be 
explained ifthe FT2 grid spacing is 65 pm less than that 
for EMT2 during thruster operation. The measured pre-test 
grid gap for both FT2 and EMT2 was 0.58 mm. These 
measurements were made with the grids at ambient 
temperature. The grid spacing is expected to change as the 
grids warm up during thruster operation. 
The electron backstreaming limit is an important parameter 
because of its effect on thruster lifetime. Thruster failure 
occurs when the electron backstreaming limit exceeds the 
voltage capability of the accelerator grid supply, for DS1 
this is -250 V. The rate at which the electron 
backstreaming limit changes is dependent on the aperture 
erosion rate which increases as the energy of the impinging 
ions increases. Since this energy depends on the magnitude 
of the accelerator grid voltage, it is desirable to minimize 
this magnitude. 
In addition to electron backstreaming measurements, 
perveance measurements are made to determine the margin 
fkom direct ion impingement at normal operating 
conditions. Rapid accelerator grid erosion occurs when 
energetic ions impinge on the grid surface. Care must be 
taken to avoid accelerating ions from the discharge chamber 
directly onto the accelerator grid surface during normal 
thruster operation. Direct ion impingement for a prolonged 
period can cause severe accelerator grid erosion because 
these ions are accelerated through the total voltage applied 
between the grids. 
The perveance limit is measured by defocusing the ion 
beam until ions directly impinge on the accelerator grid. 
Defocusing is accomplished by reducing the screen grid 
voltage. For the data presented here, the perveance limit is 
defined as the screen grid voltage at which a 0.02 mA

Figure 7 Screen Grid Transparency Comparison for FT2 and EMT2 
increase in accelerator grid current is caused by a 1 V 
decrease in screen grid potential. Perveance margin is the 
difTerence between the screen grid voltage and the perveance 
limit. 
A comparison of the perveance margin data for FT2 and 
EMT2 is shown in Figure 6. The perveance margin at 
TH12 for FT2 is higher than that at TH15 for Eh'lT2. This 
occurs because the beam current is lower at TH12 than at 
TH15 and the beamlets must defocus more before they 
impinge on the accelerator grid. When operating FT2 at 
TH15, the perveance margin initially was worse (lower) 
than that observed during EMT2 testing. However, by 
2500 hours the perveance margins for both thrusters were 
comparable. Over the first 1000 hours, the perveance 
margin increased rapidly for both thrusters, after which it 
settled out to a nearly linear rate of increase. This occurs 
because as the accelerator grid holes enlarge with time, due 
to ion sputtering, the beamlets must become more 
defocused to impinge on the accelerator grid. A shift prior 
to 124 hours is also noted in the perveance margin data far 
FT2. 
After throttling to TH8 the perveance margin is larger 
because less beam current is extracted from the thruster and 
the beamlets are firther from the edges of the accelerator 
grid apertures. It is also noted that the perveance margin 
has remained relatively constant during FT2 operation at 
THS. This is another indicator that accelerator grid aperture 
erosion is lower at TH8 than at TH15.

Screen grid transparency to ions is a measure of how 
effectively the optics extract ions from the discharge 
chamber. During screen grid transparency measurements the 
screen grid is biased 20 V negative with respect to cathode 
potential. This keeps discharge chamber electrons h m  
being collected on the screen grid. The screen grid 
transparency is defined as the ratio of the ion current 
extracted through the screen grid to the total ion current 
directed toward the screen grid. The total ion current 
directed toward the grid is the sum of the current extracted 
through the grid and the current that impinges on the 
screen grid. 
A plot comparing screen grid transparency for FT2 and 
EMT2 is shown in Figure 7. The shift over the first 124 
hours of FT2 testing is also noted in the transparency data. 
After this initial shift in screen grid transparency, the 
transparency measured at TH12 on FT2 and at TH15 
during EMT2 testing were comparable. At full power the 
FT2 screen transparency was less than that of EMT2 up to 
about 2500 hours. After about 3000 hours, the screen grid 
transparency for FT2 at full power was slightly higher than 
that for EMT2. The reason for these, diffaences at full 
power is not known; however, they may be due to small 
differences in grid spacing between the two thrusters. After 
throttling to TH8 the transparency has been higher than 
that observed at TH15 or TH12 after the shift during the 
first 124 hours of FT2 testing. The transparency has 
remained relatively constant during operation at TH8, 
which is yet more evidence that erosion of the ion optics 
system is low at this operating point. Although the 
observed transparency differences are relatively small, they 
108 
do affect discharge chamber performance; more ions must be 
produced to provide the desired beam current if the 
transparency is smaller. 
Discharge Chamber Performance 
Shown in Figures 8 and 9 are the cathode and main flow 
rates, respectively. At full power the FT2 cathode flow rate 
is 2.7% less and the main flow rate is 1.9% lower than in 
EMT2 testing. The FT2 test plan called for the flow rates 
to be the same as those during EMT2 testing. However, a 
calibration error which was not discovered until 3780 hours 
resulted in the FT2 flows being lower than the EMT2 
flows by the stated amounts. The main flow controller 
drifted an additional 1% lower between 2000 and 2350 
hours. The flow meters were recalibrated at 2350 hours; 
however, the calibration error was dependent on the 
ambient temperature which was merent for the previous 
calibration. The error introduced by the temperature 
difference coincided with the drift in the main flow meter, 
so the main flow rate remained the additional 1% low until 
the calibration error was discovered. The lower flow rates 
do not appear to have a deleterious effect on FT2. Because 
the lower flow rates results in less cold flow propellant 
loss, FT2 operation at the lower flow rates was continued 
after the calibration mor was discovered. 
The discharge current for both FT2 and EMT2 is shown in 
Figure 10. The discharge current at TH12 and TH8 during 
FT2 testing are lower than that at TH15 because fewer ions 
are required to provide the smaller beam currents extracted 
from the thruster at lower power levels. The initial 2974 
hours of EMT2 testing were conducted using a breadboard 
PPU. The breadboard PPU discharge power supply was 
limited to 13.5 A until 2100 hours when it was modified 
to allow operation at higher discharge currents. After 
throttling FT2 to full power, the discharge current was 
about 0.5 A higher than that for EMT2 and the rate of 
increase was lower. The FT2 discharge current remained 
higher up to 3000 hours when the EMT2 current surpassed 
that of FT2. These trends are similar to the trends in screen 
grid transparency. In Ref. [ 111, a strong correlation between 
14 (where5 is the screen grid transparency) and discharge 
current was noted. The factor I - -  represents the fiaction of 
discharge chamber ions directed toward the ion optics 
which strike the screen grid. Because more ions must be 
produced to make up for the ions lost to the screen grid 
some sensitivity of the discharge current to this loss is 
anticipated; however, the sensitivity is much stronger than 
a l/f, dependence suggested by a preliminary analysis using 
the discharge chamber performance model developed by 
Brophy [12]. The observed correlation may be due to ion 
optics erosion. As the accelerator grid apertures erode, the 
area through which neutral propellant can escape fiom the 
discharge chamber increases. As a result the neutral density 
in the discharge chamber decreases and a higher discharge 
current is needed to produce the ions required for the beam 
current. In addition, material sputtered ftom the accelerator 
grid can redeposit on the screen grid reducing the screen 
grid aperture area; this results in a decrease in screen grid 
.transparency. The combined effect of increasing accelerator 
grid aperture size and decreasing screen grid aperture size 
may account for the observed correlation. More work to 
adequately model the observed correlation is needed.

Figure 11 Discharge Voltage Comparison for FT2 and EMT2 
Since throttling to TH8, the FT2 discharge current has 
been decreasing. The reason for this decrease is not known; 
however, the discharge voltage, shown in Figure 11, is 
higher for FT2 than E m 2  while FT2 was operating at the 
lower power levels. The voltages were roughly equal at fid 
power until about 2000 hours After 2000 hours the FT2 
discharge voltage was about 0.5V higher than EMT2 
during full power operation. The discharge voltage for FT2 
at TH8 is about 2 V higher than that of Eh4T2 operating at 
TH15. 
A comparison of the discharge loss for EMT2 and FT2 is 
shown in Figure 12. It is seen that the discharge loss for 
FT2 is higher by about 12 eV/ion than that for EMT2 
until the discharge current became lower for FT2 than 
EMT2 at 3000 hours; after that the discharge loss for FT2 
decreased as the discharge voltage decreased. Mer 4000 
hours the discharge loss for both thrusters, operating at fid 
power, coincide even though the discharge currents and 
discharge voltages are slightly different for the two 
thrusters. After throttling FT2 to TH8, the discharge loss 
increased about 8 eV/ion and then slowly decreased back to 
a level comparable to that observed during operation at fid 
power. 
The double-to-single ion current ratio is shown in Figure 
13 for FT2 and EMT2. Initial pointing of the ExB probe 
during FT2 testing was done before the shift occurred in 
the ion optics performance parameters over the first 124 
hours of the test. The probe was aligned so that the single 
ion current to the probe was maximized. The shift in the 
ion optics may have caused a change in the direction at 
8000 
which the ExB probe received the maximum single ion 
current, resulting in low measured double ion ratio. The 
probe was operated with the initial pointing until 607 
hours, when the probe was realigned to receive the 
maximum single ion current. With this pointing, the 
double-to-single ion ratio for FT2 was found to be 
comparable to but slightly less than that of EMT2 at fuSl 
power. The difference is thought to be due to slight 
alignment variations of the probe between the two tests. 
Another factor which could contribute to the diffmcx is 
that the probe used in the EMT2 test accepted ions fiom a 
3.1 cm wide strip across the thruster diameter while the 
probe used in FT2 testing accepts ions over a 1.8 cm wide 
strip across the thruster diameter. The difference in width if 
the acceptance area may affect the observed double-to-single 
ion ratio if doubles are preferentially produced near the 
thruster centerline. Mer reducing the FT2 power level to 
TH8, the double-to-single ion ratio has remained relatively 
constant at a lower level than that observed at full power. 
This occurs because the plasma density is lower in the 
discharge chamber at lower power levels. Most of the 
doubly ionized propellant is produced by electron 
collisions with singly ionized xenon; because the single 
ion density and electron density (proportional to discharge 
current) are smaller at lower power levels, fwer double 
ions are produced as the power level decreases. 
Neutralizer Performance 
The neutralizer is used to provide neutralizing electrons to 
the ion beam. To keep the neutralizer fiom extinguishing 
during recycles, the neutralizer keeper power supply is used

Figure 14 Neutralizer Flow Comparison for FT2 and EMT2 
to maintain the neutralizer keeper current at the level 
specified in the throttle table. The neutralizer keeper 
voltage is affected by the keeper current and the neutralizer 
flow rate. 
The neutralizer flow rate for FT2 and EMT2 are shown in 
Figure 14. At the start of the EMT2 test, the full power 
neutralizer flow rate was set at 3.0 sccm. Although there 
was enough margin to avoid plume mode operation at full 
power, the neutralizer flow rate was increased when the 
DSl xenon flow system was designed with the discharge 
cathode and neutralizer flow rates nearly matched [13, 141. 
The higher neutralizer flow rates used in the DS1 flow 
system are also being used for FT2. 
The neutralizer keeper voltages for FT2 and EMT2 are 
shown in Figure 15. The keeper voltage for FT2 is 
generally lower than that for EMT2 at full power. The 
spikes in the keeper voltage for both tests correspond to 
situations where the cathodes were conditioned after 
cryopump regeneration. The lower keeper voltage on FT2 
during full power operation is accounted for by the higher 
flow rate. After throttling FT2 to TH8, the neutralizer 
keeper voltage is higher than that of EMT2 operating at full 
power. The keeper voltage is also an indicator of how near 
the neutralizer is to plume mode with higher keeper voltage 
indicating there is less margin to avoid plume mode. 
Thrust Magnitude and Direction 
Shown in Figure 16 is a comparison of the thrust 
calculated from electrical thruster parameters for FT2 and 
EMT2 and thrust measurements made during FT2 testing. 
The calculated thrust is based on the measured beam 
current and voltage, a constant value of 0.98 for the beam 
divergence correction and a correction for multiply charged 
ions based on a curve fit to centerhe double ion current 
measurements as a function of propellant utilization 
efficiency in a 30 cm, ring-cusp inert gas thruster [15, 161. 
The uncertainty in the calculated values is *2.3 percent. 
The thrust measurements for FT2 agree with the calculated 
thrust within the measurement uncertainty of *2.5 percent. 
Shown in Figures 17 and 18 are comparisons of the vertical 
and horizontal thrust vector angles, respectively, for FT2 
and EMT2. Transients of about 0.2' over the fmt 1500 
hours are observed in the horizontal angle for both 
thrusters. A transient of about 0.2' lasting about 1000 
hours is seen in the vertical angle for FT2. A short term 
transient of about 0.1" over about 500 hours followed by a 
long term drift of about 0.lo variations is observed in the 
EMT2 data. A shift of about 0.15' is observed in both the 
horizontal and vertical angles when FT2 was throttled hm 
TH15 to TH8. These changes in thrust vector are small; a 
typical s p a c e d  gimbal system, with a range of several 
degrees, can easily compensate for the observed variations. 
Neutralizer and Cathode Electrical Isolation 
Another generic failure mode for ion thrusters is loss of 
electrical isolation between components. Degradation in the 
electrical isolation for neutralizer and discharge cathode 
components has been observed during FT2 testing. The 
electrical isolation between components is measured using

a digital ohm meter and is also measured using a Hypot. 
The portable DC Hypot (manufactured by Associated 
Research, Inc.) is a high voltage (up to 15 kV) low current 
(2 mA maximum) power supply used to measure electrical 
impedance between components with high voltage applied 
across them. Hypot impedance tests conducted on 
neutralizer and discharge cathode components of FT2 ate 
done at 1000 V. 
Degradation of neutralizer keeper to neutralizer common 
impedance, as well as the impedance of both components 
to facility ground, has been observed during FT2 testing. It 
is possible to operate the thruster if either the neutralizer 
keeper or neutralizer common is shorted to facility ground 
(or spacecraft ground in flight); however, the thruster would 
no longer be decoupled fiom ground. Degradation of 
neutralizer keeper-neutralizer common impedance, if severe 
enough, can cause thruster failure. The impedance level 
where neutralizer failure occurs is somewhere between 10 
and 1 Q .  Depending on the power level at which the 
thruster is operating, the neutralizer keeper collects either 
1.5 or 2.0A. Typically the neutralizer keeper voltage is 
between 12 and 15V as shown in Figure 15. If the 
neutralizer keeper-neutralizer common impedance w m  
1 Q,  most of the neutralizer keeper current would flow 
through the low impedance leakage path and it would be 
impossible to maintain the neutralizer discharge. At 10 Q 
impedance roughly a tenth of the neutralizer keeper current 
would flow through the leakage path. Although this would 
reduce the margin fiom plume mode operation, the 
neutralizer would probably function well enough to allow 
thruster operation. 
The impedance between neutralizer keeper and facility 
ground is shown in Figure 19. The horizontal dashed line 
at 40 MQ represents the largest resistance the digital ohm 
meter is capable of measuring. As measured by the Hypot, 
the isolation between neutralizer keeper and facility ground 
was over 10 GQ before the FT2 test was started. The 
impedance decreased to about 40 MQ after 448 hours of 
thruster operation. Digital ohm meter readings were taken 
in addition to the Hypot readings. Digital ohm meter 
readings that exceed 40 MQ are shown as solid circles at 
40 MQ on the plot. Between 448 hours and 3200 hours 
the neutralizer keeper-facility ground isolation decreased to 
about 100 kQ and has remained relatively constant at this 
value. 
The cause of the degradation in the neutralizer keeper- 
facility ground impedance will not be determined until the 
neutralizer can be inspected after completion of the FT2 
test. However, possible causes for the observed decrease in 
electrical isolation include degradation of wiring insulation 
and deposition of a conductive coating on ceramic 
insulators. Decreased impedance could also be caused by 
thin films of carbon-backsputtered onto the thruster hm 
the graphite panels which line the interior of the vacuum 
facility-spalling and bridging the gap between neutralizer 
keeper and facility ground surfaces. It is thought that the 
electrostatic force produced by the Hypot voltage caused 
such films or flakes of conducting material to move and 
bridge the gap between neutralizer keeper and facility 
ground during the two Hypot measurements taken between 
2500 and 3000 hours. The impedance measured with the

digital ohm meter prior to these Hypot measurements was 
in the 100 kQ range. During the Hypot measurements, the 
impedance decreased to the 1 kQ range. The material 
causing the decreased impedance apparently cleared during 
subsequent thruster operation and the impedance has 
remained at about 100 kQ. 
During normal thruster operation the neutralizer keeper 
couples through the plasma to the ground potential vacuum 
facility walls; as a result neutralizer keeper voltage is 
within 5 V of facility ground. The leakage current through 
the -100 kQ neutralizer keeper-facility ground impedance 
is on the order of 50 PA. The power consumed in this 
impedance is about 0.25 mW which does not significantly 
impact thruster performance. 
Neutralizer common to facility ground impedance is shown 
in Figure 20. Prior to the start of the test this impedance 
was greater than 1 GQ. The electrical isolation decayed 
over the first 3200 hours of the test to about 10 MQ and it 
has remained at this value since then. Possible causes for 
the reduction in neutralizer common-facility ground 
impedance include deterioration of wiring insulation and 
degradation of the neutralizer propellant flow isolator. 
The impedance between neutralizer keeper and neutralizer 
common is shown in Figure 21. Here the impedance 
measured with the digital ohm meter includes two leakage 
paths in parallel. One path is between the components 
independent of ground. The other includes the leakage path 
of each component to ground which are in series. The 
Hypot has three leads and the impedance between the 
components can be measured while the current to ground is 
shunted around the Hypot ammeter. The neutralizer 
common-facility ground impedance dominates the series 
path going through ground. In addition, the series path has 
a smaller impedance than the path independent of ground; 
therefore, the digital ohm meter readings are similar to 
those between neutralizer common and facility ground. The 
Hypot readings show that the impedance in the path 
independent of ground decreased during the first 2000 hours 
of the test and then jumped back up to the G Q  range until 
about 5000 hours at which point it decreased to the MQ 
range. At the MQ level observed in the test, the leakage 
currents are on the pA level and do not significantly impact 
the neutralizer operation. Possible causes for the reduction 
in neutralizer keeper-neutralizer common impedance include 
neutralizer heater radiation shielding contacting the 
neutralizer keeper and a conducting layer depositing on the 
ceramic used to isolate neutralizer keeper fiom neutralizer 
common. 
Degradation of discharge cathode common to cathode 
keeper impedance and discharge cathode common to anode 
isolation has been observed during FT2 testing. It is 
possible to operate the discharge chamber if cathode keeper 
is shorted to cathode common. The cathode keeper, tied to 
anode through a 1 kQ resistor, is in close proximity to the 
cathode and is used to start the discharge. If cathode keeper 
is shorted to cathode common, the discharge must be 
started to the anode which is physically further away h 
the cathode than the cathode keeper; this makes starting the 
discharge more difficult. Degradation of cathode common- 
anode impedance, if severe enough, can cause thruster

failure. The impedance level where failure occurs is 
somewhere between 10 and 1 Q .  Depending on the power 
level at which the thruster is operating, the discharge 
current between the discharge cathode and anode can vary 
between 4 and 16 A and the discharge voltage is usually 
between 24 and 29V. If the cathode common-anode 
impedance were 1 52, most of the discharge current would 
flow through the low impedance leakage path and it would 
be impossible to operate the discharge chamber. At 10 D 
impedance over 2 A would flow through the leakage path. 
Although it might be possible to operate the thruster with 
such a loss, discharge chamber perfiiance would be 
seriously degraded. 
Discharge cathode common-anode impedance is shown in 
Figure 22. Prior to the start of this test, this impedance 
was greater than 10 GQ. By 2000 hours the impedance 
decreased to the MQ range where it has remained relatively 
constant since. Possible causes for the reduction in cathode 
common-anode impedance include a conducting layer 
depositing on the ceramic used to isolate cathode common 
from anode or a conductive path between pins in the 
thruster wiring cable connector. 
Discharge cathode keeper to discharge cathode common 
impedance is shown in Figure 23. The impedance was 
greater than 1 GQ up until 6408 hours. At that point the 
digital ohm meter measurement was greater than 40 MQ. 
During Hypot testing the cathode keeper shorted to cathode 
common. The Hypot reached its current limit of 2 mA at 
less than 20V. Impedances less than 10 kQ cannot be 
measured accurately with the Hypot due to the resolution aF 
the analog voltmeter. Subsequent measurement with the 
digital ohm meter showed that the impedance was less than 
1 Q .  
Mer the 8200 hour EMT2 test, up to 50 pm thick 
deposits were found on the upstream edge of the cathode 
keeper orifice [4]. Such deposits may have peeled away 
fiom the FT2 cathode keeper and shorted to the cathode 
during the Hypot measurement at 6408 hours. 
The voltage between cathode keeper and cathode common 
is monitored during thruster operation; typically it is 3 to 
5 V. An intermittent short developed between cathode 
keeper and cathode common between 5850 and 6000 hours 
of the FT2 test; this caused the cathode keeper voltage to 
jump between -3.5 V and -0.4 V. After 6000 hours the 
cathode keeper voltage has remained at about 0.4 V. When 
the thruster was turned off and cooled down, the cathode 
keeper-cathode common short cleared and the digital ohm 
meter reading at 6597 hours was greater than 40 mQ. 
Since 5977 hours, the discharge has been more " l t  to 
ignite on FT2. Prior to this the discharge could be ignited 
with the 50 V open circuit laboratory power supply. After 
5977 hours, the discharge could not be initiated with the 
50V supply and the 250 V start supply has been used. 
Apparently electrostatic forces cause a flake to move and 
short cathode keeper to cathode common during start 
attempts. Although it is more diEcult to ignite, the 
discharge is igniting at a lower voltage than the 650 V 
available h m  the start supply on DS1. While the loss d

eliminate this problem in future thrusters. 
8. CONCLUSIONS 
Over 6,700 hours of operation have been accumulated on 
the DS1 flight spare thruster (FT2) during an on-going 
test. The thruster is performing well and no problems 
which would preclude processing 125 kg of xenon with 
this thruster have been identified. However, one area of 
concern is degradation of electrical isolation between the 
discharge cathode keeper and the discharge cathode 
common. This has resulted in the inability to ignite the 
discharge with a 50 V laboratory power supply which had 
been used prior to the loss of electrical isolation. Since 
then a 250 V start supply has been used to start the 
discharge. This is still less than the 650 V available for 
starting the discharge on DS1. Slightly poorer discharge 
chamber performance during the first 3900 hours and again 
after throttling to 1.5 kW for FT2 compared to that of 
EMT2 has been observed. In addition the electron 
backstreaming limit for FT2 is 6 V lower (worse) than that 
of EMT2 during full power operation. During operation of 
the flight spare thruster at 1.5 kW, measurements indicate 
that very little erosion of the ion optics has occurred. 
Erosion of the ion optics system can lead to thruster failure 
either through inability to prevent electron backstreaming 
or due to structural failure of the accelerator grid. Lower 
erosion rates should result in increased propellant 
throughput prior to ion optics failure at lower power levels.
