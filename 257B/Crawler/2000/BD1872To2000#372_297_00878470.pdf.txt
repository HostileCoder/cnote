Abstract- The SeaWinds Calibration Ground 
Station (CGS) is a novel Ku-band receiving 
station that supports the June 1999-launched 
J P W A S A  SeaWinds scatterometer radar which 
measures the near-surface wind speeds over 90% 
of the ice-free oceans. The CGS purpose is to 
measure very accurately the radar pulse timing, 
frequency and amplitude characteristics in order 
to monitor independently the radar and spacecraft 
platform performance over the course of the 
mission. These data are critical to maintaining or 
improving the quality of the end-data product. 
Results are presented here which show the ability 
to measure spacecraft pulse timing to microsecond 
detail, spacecraft attitude to better than 0.1 degrees, 
and output amplitude that will in future work allow 
estimation of the spacecraft on-orbit antenna 
pattern. These efforts will improve registration of 
the scatterometer-derived wind map to the Earths 
coordinate system and provide an independent 
assessment of the instrument quality over the life 
of the mission.

1. INTRODUCTION 
The SeaWinds Calibration Ground Station (CGS) 
is a novel Ku-band receiving station that supports 
the JPLLNASA SeaWinds scatterometer radar 
which measures the near-surface wind speeds over 
90% of the ice-free oceans. The SeaWinds 
scatterometer is a Ku-band (13,402 MHz) radar 
that obliquely illuminates the ocean's surface with 
the radar beam and measures the scattering cross 
section, oo, from a plurality of azimuth angles. For 
a given patch of sea surface, The oo varies in an

approximately cosinusoidal manner depending on 
illumination azimuth angle, surface wind speed and 
direction. Analysis of the o'data allows the 
derivation of an estimate of the wind velocity 
vector for that patch. 
The SeaWinds instrument has an 803 km circular 
orbit and uses a rotating, 0.85 meter offset 
paraboloid antenna to produce a pair of conically 
scanned pencil beams at nominal angles of 40 and 
46 degrees from the nadir. The beams illuminate 
an elliptical footprint on the sea surface of about 25 
km wide by 50 km deep (major axis is radial from 
the spacecraft nadir-point). On board processing of 
the echo data allows resolution improvement to 
slices 25km wide by about 6 km deep. Spacecraft 
platform attitude instabilities can greatly affect the 
ability to accurately register the reduced wind 
vector map with the actual position on the earth; 
unobserved instrument frequency and Doppler 
estimation variation provide a mechanism to force 
incorrect range measurement, again affecting 
eventual data registration; and instrument 
amplitude and gain variation can cause errors in the 
estimation of received echo strength and thus the 
derived wind velocity vector. All of these effects 
were observed to some extent on a predecessor 
instrument, NSCAT, which was in a similar orbit 
during 1996-97. There are a variety of methods that 
can provide partial calibration, including natural 
ground targets such as the Antarctic and Greenland 
ice sheets and the Brasilian rain forest, in addition 
to the detailed telemetry from the spacecraft itself. 
The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) SeaWinds 
Calibration Ground Station (CGS), located at the 
NASA-Johnson Space Center White Sands Test 
Facility at Las Cruces, New Mexico, is not only a 
precision receiver and an accurate time and 
frequency measurement device but also a 
radiometer that provides the ability to calibrate the 
receiver by using both sky and local targets of very 
accurately known temperature and stability. The 
CGS antenna captures the incident signal, which is 
0-7803-5846-5/00/$10.00  2000 IEEE 
37 
then digitized, decimated and streamed into a one 
Gigabyte buffer prior to being written to disk. 
Initially, the large volume of data is scanned to 
identify the approximate pulse timing. Then, more 
extensive processing using an iterative matched 
filtering technique accurately locates the precise 
beginning and end of each received pulse, the pulse 
center frequency and Doppler shift, in addition to 
determining the total pulse power and pulse 
amplitude characteristics. 
Standard 
This data has so far proven extremely valuable in 
helping to resolve spacecraft attitude control issues, 
orbital variation and spacecraft on-board clock 
anomalies. Future work is planned to use the 
amplitude and timing data to help reconstruct the 
actual on-orbit spacecraft antenna pattern, 
especially with respect to sidelobe shape and level.

The core of the CGS is a fairly straightforward dual 
conversion super-heterodyne receiver with the final

receiver is packaged to increase thermal stability. 
Internal and external reference sources are 
provided to allow self calibration. 
A computer controlled pedestal is used to point the 
CGS antenna at the predicted spacecraft location. 
The receiver front end, as well as the calibration

aluminum box on the pedestal, within a fiberglass 
and Nomexo composite radome on top of the 
building.

CGS is mirrored to a server at the Jet Propulsion Overview 
Laboratory Physical Oceanography Distributed 
Active Archive Center (PODAAC). CGS data 
users can retreive the data from either the CGS 
directly, or from PO.DAAC. 
The CGS is installed in a temperature controlled 
building at White Sands Test Facility near Las 
Cruces, New Mexico. Figure 1 shows a block

aperture of 12 cm designed to have a maximum 
gain Of '"' dB degree Of The SeaWinds signals are linearly polarized (inner boresight. This reduces the pointing accuracy beam horizontal, outer beam vertical). A circularly requirements, which are influenced by both the polarized antenna reduces the effect of the absolute

rotational orientation of the antenna, and eliminates 
the need to switch between antennas to receive the 
different signals. A circular to linear transformation 
section between the circular horn throat and the 
rectangular WR-62 waveguide to the receiver is 
used to make the antenna subsystem circularly 
polarized with the entire subsystem having an axial 
ratio of < O S  dB. A 2 degree error in rotational 
position (axis along the boresight) will result in a 
system gain error of less than 0.01 dB. 
The directivity of the antenna, as calculated from 
integrated pattern measurements, is 20.09 dB, 
which compares well with the design directivity of 
20 dB. Note that because of the circular 
polarization, the received signal, which is linearly 
polarized, will be attenuated by 3 dB. 
The receiver front end (and antenna) is mounted on 
an elevation over azimuth pedestal within a 
fiberglass and NomexB honeycomb composite 
radome on top of the CGS building. The radome is 
a 1.2 meter diameter cylinder with 1.5 meter tall 
vertical sides, which reduces the chances of dew or 
dust collecting on the surface. The central axis 
matches that of the pedestal, so that the incidence 
angle or distance from the aperture to the radome 
wall does not change with azimuth at a particular 
elevation angle. The mechanical dimensions of the 
radome were carefully controlled to minimize 
changes in attenuation with look angle. The 
measured variations in the 5.08 mm thick 
composite wall (shown in Figure 3), are on the 
order of .033 mm, and are calculated to result in 
loss variations of less than 0.01 dB. Actual radome 
loss is being measured using a radiomet$ 
technique described by Seidel and Stelzreid-, 
involving scanning the cold night sky (and the 
radome) using the CGS receiver as a radiometer. 
Receiver Electronics 
The receiver (block diagram in Figure 4) is a 
standard double conversion superheterodyne with a 
first IF of 395 MHz and an output frequency of 35 
MHz. The final conversion to baseband is done by 
undersampling at a final rate of 5.1875 MSPS, 
which effectively places the signal at 3/4 of the 
sample rate. The mechanical packaging was 
designed to keep the temperatures stable during a 
measurement, to reduce gain fluctuations. Internal 
calibration sources are provided to calibrate the 
receiver gain. Frequency and timing accuracy are 
determined by the design, and require no 
calibration. 
The receiver is physically divided into two parts. 
The first part, referred to as the “antenna box” is a 
steel enclosure approximately 76x60 cm mounted 
on a 1 cm aluminum plate which is on the pedestal 
in the radome. The entire enclosure is covered in

radar absorber to reduce the effect of reflections 
affecting the antenna pattem, and to provide some 
thermal isolation from the environment. There are 
also three precision resistance thermometers (4 
wire RTDs) inside the enclosure which are used to 
log the receiver temperature. The second half of the 
receiver is in a standard chassis in the equipment 
rack located below the pedestal in the air- 
conditioned room. 
A low noise amplifier at 13402 MHz is used to set 
the system noise figure as well as provide some 50 
dB of gain before the first mixer. A local oscillator 
at 13007 MHz (phase locked to the 10 MHz 
reference) is used to mix to a 395 MHz first IF. 
This IF signal is carried by coaxial cable to the 
receiver chassis. 
In the receiver chassis, the 395 MHz IF is mixed 
with a 360 MHz local oscillator (also locked to the 
10 MHz reference) to produce an output signal at 
35 MHz nominal center frequency. A 2 MHz 
bandwidth Butterworth filter is used to limit the 
bandwidth prior to sampling. 
The data is sampled by a commercial high speed 12 
bit A/D board (Gage PCI-8012A) modified to 
accept a 41.5 MHz extemal clock derived from the 
stable 10 MHz reference. The board internally 
decimates the samples by a factor of 8, resulting in 
an actual sample rate of 5.1875 
Megasamples/Second. The 35 MHz IF is aliased to 
an apparent frequency of -1.3125 MHz, which is 
approximately in the middle of the sampled 
bandwidth of approximately 2.6 MHz, which keeps 
the desired signal away from DC offsets and 
sample clock related spurs. The system gain is set 
sc .hat the maximum received signals are about 
3dB below A/D saturation. The total digitized 
noise power (looking at a cloudy sky) has a 
standard deviation of 13.4 LSB. or about -44 dBFS. 
In a typical capture, 10 seconds of data is collected 
for each of 4 beam crossings, as the two spacecraft- 
transmitted beams sweep over the CGS. On days 
when only the outer beam crosses the CGS, two 
captures of 20 seconds each are made. The 1 Gbyte 
memory buffer available allows collection of up to 
51 seconds of data, when recording the IRIG time 
code on the second channel. 
Absolute frequency stability is maintained by the 
use of a GPS disciplined 10 MHz reference 
oscillator, which is used to generate all local 
oscillators and the sampling clock. The oscillator is 
specified to be accurate within 1 part in 1E12 over 
1 day. IRIG-B time code from the GPS receiver is 
digitized simultaneously to provide an independent 
check on the capture timing. In addition, the 1 PPS 
output from the GPS receiver is used to 
synchronize the start of data captures, so that 
absolute sample time is known to approximately 
200 nSec. The GPS receiver also provides an 
accurate position (averaged over time) of the CGS, 
which is necessary to calculate ranges and actual 
look angles in post processing. 
Computers and support equipment 
The CGS is controlled by a set of 5 PC type 
computers running Windows NT8. They are 
interconnected by a 100 Mbps ethemet. One PC is 
dedicated to the high speed data acquisition 
interface. Another is used to control the pedestal, 
operate the calibration equipment, and log various 
engineering parameters. A third is used to capture 
video images and provide other support functions.

Finally, two computers are servers which connect 
to separate redundant connections to the internet; 
one via WSTF‘s intemal network and the other via 
a microwave link to White Sands Missile Range. 
3. CALBRATION 
Calibration of the CGS is accomplished by using 
both external references and internal sources. 
Internal precision sources provide a stable gain 
calibration. A remote controlled beacon transmitter 
on a hill top about 3 km away provides an end to 
end functional test as well as a test of antenna 
pattern. Figure 5 illustrates the calibration 
equipment within the pedestal mounted enclosure 
(the “antenna box”). 
Self Calibration 
The CGS provides several ways of being self 
calibrated against an intemal stable reference. A 
single ferrite switch is used to connect the LNA 
input to a calibration source instead of the antenna. 
To reduce the effect of mismatch on the antenna 
port, during calibrations, the antenna is pointed at 
either cold sky or at an RF absorber panel mounted 
on the inside of the radome. 
The calibration path consists of a switched noise 
source and a tone injection path. The noise source 
has an ENR of 14.491 dB, and so, provides a test 
signal near the bottom of the system dynamic range 
(The kTB noise floor is -111 dBm). There is also 
provision for injecting an externally supplied tone 
at a level of about -75 dBm, which corresponds to 
the top of the dynamic range. 
The noise source is the most accurate level 
reference. It is based on a semiconductor noise 
diode which has a noise brightness temperature of 
8446K (20 uncertainty = 53K), or an ENR of 
14.491 dB. The noise source is placed in an 
insulated enclosure which is thermostatically 
controlled to 40 degrees Celsius within .05 degrees. 
This “oven” is located within the thermally 
massive and insulated receiver box on the pedestal. 
Stability measurements performed at NIST using 
their WR-62 radiometer indicate that the noise 
power output of the noise source does not vary 
over a 4 day period by more than the uncertainty of 
the radiometer (about 10 K). The output power of 
the receiver is measured by calculating the variance 
of the digitized samples. 
In addition, a tone signal may be injected through a 
calibrated path at the same point as the noise 
signal. The power of the injected signal is 
measured by a NIST Type IV Power meter’ at 
approximately 0 dBm prior to being attenuated 
approximately 70 dB. The calibration tone is 
generated by a standard laboratory synthesized 
signal generator (HP model 8673C). Tone signals 
are useful for evaluating the performance of the 
digitizer, with the usual analysis technique 
consisting of fitting a sine wave to the digitized 
samples, and examining the deviations from the 
ideal. 
For highest accuracy, self calibrations cannot be 
done while the spacecraft is above the horizon. The 
sidelobes of the SeaWinds antenna are 30-40 dB 
below the main lobe, which is approximately at the 
thermal noise floor of the receiver, and are easily 
detected with a radiometric approach. 
Daily Radiometric Gain Calibrations 
Each morning, at 11 15Z (approximately 415AM 
local), a radiometric gain calibration is performed, 
making 0.2 second measurements of the ovenized 
noise source, the ovenized load, and the sky. This 
schedule was established prior to launch, and a 
potential problems has been identified because the 
spacecraft is above the horizon at this time on “day 
1” of the cycle during the revolution (100 minutes) 
before the “morning” capture. A change in the 
scheduled radiometric calibration time to an earlier 
time is planned to eliminate the possibility of the 
measurement being corrupted by sidelobe power. 
Figure 6 shows the results of this calibration over a 
several month time span. 
The raw gain is calculated by comparing the 
variances of the sampled ,data when the noise 
source is on (T=8446K) and off (T=313K). A 
nominal noise bandwidth of 2 MHz was assumed 
for this calculation, and the noise power was 
calculated using the nominal A/D subsystem gain 
to convert A/D codes to power at the A/D input. 
where: 
THO* = 8446K 
TCold = 313K 
There are some apparent changes in gain (on 29 
July and 19 August) which are the result of the 
noise source oven being turned off during system 
maintenance activities. The overall downward 
trend in system gain may be an artifact, as it is less 
than the uncertainty in the measurement, which is 
42 
at least 0.03 dB, due in large part to the 50K 
uncertainty in the 8446K reference. 
Figure 6 also shows an estimate of the sky 
brightness temperature, calculated as in Eq 2: 
where G is the gain as calculated in Equation (1). 
Of particular interest in this plot are the apparent 
spikes in sky temperature (in mid August) which 
maintained on the CGS, with the oldest data being 
removed to make room for new captures. 
The CGS includes a weather station on the 
building, and logs the current wind, rainfall, 
temperature, humidity and barometric pressure 
every minute. The rain and humidity measurements 
can be used to evaluate whether a data capture was 
made when it is raining, or when there may be 
condensed dew or rain on the radome, either of 
which would reduce the accuracy of the amplitude 
measurements. Various other station data such as 
GPS receiver performance, video images of the 
pedestal and radome, and the receiver internal

Figure 6 - Raw Radiometric Calibration Data 
were the result of the antenna being pointed at the 
external ambient load (at approximately 290K) 
rather than the sky. The sky temperature shows 
variations which appear to be correlated with 
periods of high rainfall and cloud cover. These 
radiometric measurement were made with the 
antenna pointed at the zenith, so dew, rain, or 
debris accumulating on the top of the radome will 
potentially increase the measured sky brightness 
temperature. 
4. DATA PROCESSING AND DISTRI~UTION 
A significant amount of post processing is done on 
the raw sampled data which is collected during a 
spacecraft pass. Initially, the data is broken up into 
convenient sized files corresponding to 0.1 second 
of data. It is also filtered to produce a low pass 
filtered estimate of the received power at a lower 
sample rate. Approximately 14 days of raw data is 
temperature is recorded periodically, and available 
on the CGS server. 
Two independent intemet connections are used to 
provide redundant access to the CGS servers. The 
SEAPACFTP server at PO.DAAC periodically 
mirrors the CGS server. PO.DAAC staff makes 
archival backup tapes of the data, which can be 
used for long term studies. 
Raw Data Reformatting 
The raw captured data, originally recorded to disk 
as a single 1 GB block, is reformatted into files 
corresponding to 100 milliseconds of real time, 
each of which is approximately 1 Megabyte (at the 
5.1875 MSPS rate). A header on the file provides 
the time of the capture, a text description of the 
capture (e.g. outer beam approaching) as well as 
the mean and variance of the data in the file. The 
variance is a convenient way to quickly find the 
files which have pulse data in it, since it is 
43 
essentially the average received power during that 
time interval. The digitized IRIG time code is used 
to confirm the actual time of data capture. 
Every few hours, catalog files listing all the raw 
data files and the average power estimate are 
created. These catalog files allow users to avoid 
transfemng large amounts of data for time when 
the spacecraft antenna isn’t pointing towards the 
CGS. Figure 7 illustrates an excerpt of this catalog 
file, showing the increase in average power as the 
edge of the outer beam crosses the station. 
Integrate and Dump Filtering 
The reformatting process also creates a filtered 
version of the data, which is used to find the pulses 
and to provide a quick means of evaluating the 
data. The filter is a simple integrate and dump of 
the squared input signal, with an a priori estimate 
of the DC bias removed. Each integrate and dump 
output sample is calculated as the sum of 104 input 
samples, providing an estimate of the received 
power every 20 microseconds. 
i=k*104 
At this rate (approximately 50 kSamples/Sec), the 
duration and timing of a single Seawinds pulse (1.5 
mSec) as well as the Pulse Repetition Interval 
(PRI) (5.4 mSec) can be determined to within 1%. 
Much higher accuracies can be achieved by 
utilizing multiple pulses in the calculations. 
Path loss estiinate by interstitial radiometric 
integration 
A significant source of variability in the absolute 
power measurement is the atmospheric path loss. 
One technique to measure this is to make a 
radiometric measurement along the same path as 
the signal measurement was made and use it to 
calculate an estimate of the path loss (assuming 
nominal values for the temperature of the path) as 
well as the loss contribution of the radome’. Any 
time the spacecraft is above the horizon (about 
1000 seconds) a simple radiometric measurement 
will include some power from the sidelobes of the 
spacecraft transmitter. Even very low level 
sidelobes can make a significant contribution to the 
radiometric measurement with the main lobe 
spacecraft signal being 30-40 dB above the noise 
floor. 
However, the spacecraft is only transmitting during 
a portion (about 30%) of the pulse repetition 
interval. During the remaining time, in between the 
pulses, the received power can be integrated to 
develop a radiometric measurement. The integrate 
and dump filtered dataset provides a convenient

means to find the times when the spacecraft is not 
transmitting. 
The integrate and dump samples themselves can be 
used to calculate the radiometric power, however, 
the presence of a DC bias in the sampled data 
being filtered makes this somewhat more complex. 
An estimate of the DC offset of the sampling 
process is subtracted, however, the estimate is of 
limited precision, so there is a remaining offset that 
must be taken into account. 
Consider the term being summed in (3), above, 
x,? = (Zi + b)’ 
where Zi is the true value, and b is the remaining 
bias. Expanding the squared term, we get: 
2’+22b+b’  
However, 2 is assumed to be a zero mean random 
process, so when summed, the 2Zb term falls out, 
leaving the true variance estimate and a constant 
equal to the square of the dc offset. The actual DC 
offset can be measured by integrating the A D  
output with the receiver connected to a known 
noise source. The bias term is then the difference 
between the measured offset and the estimated 
offset used in calculating the integrate and dump 
dataset. 
Refinement of noise power measurement 
When calculating the system gain, in an absolute 
sense, changes in the noise bandwidth B, in 
equation (l), above, cause proportional changes in 
the calculated gain. This noise bandwidth is set by 
an analog filter in the receiver chassis. The 
temperature of this filter is relatively constant, 
however it does change, and its aging behavior is 
unknown. 
There are also potential interfering low level 
signals which have been observed at random 
intervals, although always at the same frequency. 
These interfering signals don’t make a signficant 
difference in the primary CGS role of digitizing 
and analyzing the spacecraft transmitter signals, 
but they do contribute to low level radiometric 
measurements. 
We can improve our estimate of the noise 
bandwidth and excise the interfering signals by 
applying a digital filtering approach to artificially 
restrict the measurement bandwidth. The sample 
rate of the CGS is very accurately controlled, so a 
computational filter which depends on the sample 
rate will also have a stable bandwidth. 
The approach taken is to form an estimate of the 
power in a relatively small number of equally

wide, we can avoid using those frequencies which 
have interfering signals, or system noise near the 
folding frequencies. The power in the selected bins 
is summed, creating a filter with known noise 
bandwidth. Figure 8 illustrates the results of this 
process with a Butterworth bandpass characteristic 
superimposed. 
Observation Schedule 
The orbit of the spacecraft is such that it repeats 
every 4 days with a high degree of accuracy 
(nominally 1 km). The times and look angles for 
the beam crossings repeat on the same 4 day cycle. 
There are 2 days on which both inner and outer 
beams cross the CGS, 1 day when only the outer 
beam crosses, and 1 day when the spacecraft 
doesn’t get high enough in the sky so that any 
beams cross. Table 1 is a canonical capture 
schedule for the CGS, based upon the orbit as of 
October 1999. All times are in UTC, and look 
angles are (azimuth, elevation) relative to true 
north and local horizontal. The OlOOZ captures are 
referred to as evening captures because they occur 
at about 7PM local, and the 12002 captures are 
referred to as morning captures because they occur 
at about 6AM local. 
Scheduling Mechanics 
Every day, at 182 (noon local), an ephemeris file 
that has predicted Earth Centered Inertial (ECI) 
x,y,z coordinates of the spacecraft at 1 minute 
intervals for the next 5 days is FTP’d to the CGS. 
At 222, a series of programs is run which use these 
positions to determine when the spacecraft is above 
the nominal horizon, relative to the CGS. During 
the above horizon periods, cubical interpolation to 
calculate look angles from the CGS at successively 
finer intervals (to 0.1 second) to identify the times 
and look angles of the beam crossings, assuming 
the nominal 40 and 46 degree nadir angles from the 
spacecraft. From these data, scheduling files are 
created which control the digitizing and pedestal 
processes on a daily basis. At 232, the schedule for 
the next 24 hours is put in place, and the captures 
occur as scheduled. Overriding the default schedule 
is possible by editing the schedule files to 
accommodate unique situations, and, as well, the 
software is being enhanced to allow a more 
convenient interface for this function. 
5. SAMPLE SPACECRAFT SIGNAL 
MEASUREMENTS 
We present some typical capture data from a 
capture at 01:38:26Z on 26 October 1999. A 20 
second capture window around the predicted time 
that the outer beam would cross the CGS was 
01:38:36Z was processed. UTC is 6 hours ahead of 
local time (MDT) at the CGS, so this capture 
actually occurred about 7:30 PM in the evening on 
25 October 1999.

Figure 9 resents a series of log scaled plot of the 
integrate and dump dataset. This is the equivalent 
of the “log video” output from an analog receiver. 
The first plot (Fig. 9A shows the data for an entire 
20 second capture as the 
outer beam crosses the CGS. The 3.3 second period 
of the spacecraft antenna rotation is visible, as 
multiple passes corresponding to successive 
“elevation cuts” across the pattern. Some small 
sidelobe about 30 dB down, and 60 degrees off 
boresight are also visible. 
In the next two plots, Figures 9B and 9C, the 
central area is expanded showing more detail of the 
pulse envelopes. The detailed envelope of the 
spacecraft antenna is visible, as well as the power 
received from the side lobes of the inner beam. By 
fitting the measured spacecraft antenna pattem to 
the received data, it is possible to estimate where 
the “peak” of the pattern would be, and hence the 
absolute azimutwyaw orientation of the spacecraft 
antenna at that time. 
Figure 10 presents time and frequency domain 
plots of a single Seawinds radar pulse. In Figure 
lOA, the time domain plot, the chirped nature of 
the pulse is quite evident, with a signal to noise 
ratio of about 30 dB. Seawinds pulses are down 
chups with a chup bandwidth of 375 kHz, and this 
pulse is centered at about 250 lcHz from the 
nominal center frequency. 
Figure 10B is the power spectrum of the same 
pulse. The characteristic flat topped appearance of 
a chuped pulse is evident. The particular frequency 
folding from undersampling results in the 
frequency scale being inverted, so that high input 
frequencies appear at the left end of the plot. 
6 .  CONCLUSIONS 
The Seawinds CGS is a high performance self 
calibrating autonomous measurement receiver 
which provides accurate measurements of the 
timing and amplitude of pulses from the Seawinds 
Ku-band Scatterometer. The precisely timed data 
collected by the CGS referenced to a high quality 
time standard allows determination of spacecraft 
timing, clock, and attitude offsets with an 
independent source of data. This was particularly 
valuable in the first weeks after instrument turn on 
when the spacecraft attitude was not yet stabilized6. 
Future work is planned with the CGS to further 
characterize various aspects of the system, such as 
long term gain stability and refined path and 
radome loss estimates. Further enhancements to 
CGS operations will result from the practical 
experience gained with actual spacecraft data and 
evolving user requirements. 
The CGS will also receive and process signals 
from the second Seawinds instrument scheduled to 
be launched in late 2000 on ADEOS 11. The stable 
and repeatable measurement capability provided by 
the CGS, will provide a consistent reference to 
compare the performance of the two spaceborne 
instruments.
