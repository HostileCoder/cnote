1 Introduction 
We are now living in the internet era, where the computers, people are connected in a huge system. In 
this system, information exchange frequently and the amount of information (data quantity) continue to 
expand. The model of frequent interaction between human beings, between human and machine give 
rise to constant change in morphologies and patterns of organization. In addition, the interaction 
between environment and human in this era is highlighted and the environment is the “soil” 
human-beings depending on. The view that each individual is the historic and cultural individual breaks 
boundaries of information society and highlights the role as one side of interaction for the first time, 
which affects humans and other individuals greatly and can not be ignored. The cultural, resources and 
geographic barriers that existed among societies in the past could not hamper the flow of information 
any longer and the flow of information promotes the speed and quantity of innovation greatly. The more 
active rapid growth of cells in the body tissue more active the more stable is not specific to an individual 
within the organization form. 
In the Internet era, the concept of management is changing, as a result of which cooperative business 
philosophy has gone mainstream at present, the competitive relation between enterprises will continue to 
be diluted, while collaborative organizations similar to the supply chains, virtual enterprises will 
continue to emerge. 
In the Era of big data, the global economy is facing great challenges and the way we understand and 
form the society was changed either.

Faced with the feature of 21th contrary, Prof. Xu xusong put forward the Complexity Science 
management (CSM) theory. The hypothesis of CSM — organization is a systematic Thinking brain 
means that each organization features intelligence and intelligent structure.     
Given the above, this paper proposes a brand new concept of “large organization”, a new theory put 
forward based on CSM ideas. This paper will introduce the basic implication, theoretical framework, 
cultural entropy reduction theory and collaboration innovation theory of the large organization. 
 
2 Big organization 
Big organization is a concept. It is based on CSM Systems thinking1 as the core, an intelligent 
structure consisting of perspective, idea, platform, mode of operation, and theory. The target is providing 
the organization with wisdom. 
Big organizations understand organization as: consisting of three components - element, structure, 
and function. Tangible elements include: buildings, people, funds, books, computer … Intangible 
elements include: reputation, recognition, organizational culture, innovation and 
creativity…  Structure refers to the links or relationships between elements, including both within the 
organization and outside the organization. Link is general connections by means of Internet 
resources. Function is the ability to achieve goals. 
The three components with organization form its stock, which is the organization's long-term 
accumulation.  
Organization in big organization is a smart body, which is shown in Figure 1.1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.1   Smart body 
Larger the stock in smart body, more powerful the organization is. Big organizations believe that, in 
order to make individuals more powerful, we need to increase the stock. Approaches to increase the 
stock are: ?enhance the amount of inflows. Inflows come from many outside organizations and greater 
environment. ?have outflows at the same time. Outflows go to many outside organizations and greater 
environment. ? form a loop with stock, inflows, and outflows . 
The proposal of big organization changed our way of thinking, that is: do not just consider 
issues based on existing stock of organization and individuals; in order to make the organization stronger,      
CSM system thinking

we must resort to other organizations and environmental forces, that is to have inflows; at the same time, 
we should also promote other organizations and environment to be powerful, this is the outflow. Only if 
other organizations and environment become more powerful, organization and individuals can 
become more powerful. This is the organization's wisdom. Big organization is 
a smart body. Big organization’s thinking – stock, inflows and outflows forming a loop, is shown in 
Figure 1.2. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1.2   stock, inflows, and outflows form a loop 
Therefore, big organization refers to an organization large enough to go beyond national boundaries, 
beyond the boundaries of specific industries. It is "big" in terms of geographic boundaries, but also a 
transnational organization, and "big" the in terms of culture and psychology. The 
"big" means an organization can operate either according to Eastern culture or Western culture. 
The boundaries of big organizations are not based on administrative boundaries, nor are determined 
by upstream and downstream relationship of the industry chain.  They are based on the 
organization’s needs and rely on people's imagination. Meanwhile, organizational 
boundaries and constantly changing, i.e., big organization has the characteristics of no boundaries. This 
feature makes the flow of information fast and convenient, and easy to disclose and share information. 
 
3 Intellectual structure of big organization  
Big organizational intellectual structure includes five aspects: big organization’s perspective; big 
organization’s concept; big organization’s mode of operation; big organization’s platform; big 
organization’s theory.

  Big organization’s perspective includes:  
? Overall perspective - based on the CSM overall theory. Overall perspective treats organizational 
behavior from the heterogeneity of time and space, namely: organization's constituent elements, in 
addition to the tangible, more attention paid to the intangible, such as the organization's reputation, 
recognition …; organization’s structure, in addition to connection among constituent elements within the 
organization, should also consider the relationship among the various connections outside the 
organization; organization’s function, in addition to existing features, should be goal-oriented and 
change its function, and also change the connection among elements. 
?Dynamic perspective - based on CSM interaction theory. Dynamic perspective treats organizational 
behavior from interaction among individuals within organization, interaction among organizations, 
interaction between organization and environment, namely: Attention should be paid to self organization, 
which is a very important capability and will produce heterogeneity, unpredictability, and even a new 
organization and evolve into a new pattern of behavior; attention should be paid to the dynamics of 
coordination with other organizations, common value upgrade; organization cannot just concern about 
stability, productivity but should also pay attention to adaptation, including anti-aggravation and the 
ability to restore function. 
? New resource perspective – based on CSM new resource theory. New resource perspective treats 
organizational behavior from the organization’s creativity, value, especially genetic nature of resource, 
namely: attention should be paid to intangible resources, and creating intangible resources; focus should 
be on nurturing scarce and irreplaceable resource, which is valuable; focus should also be self resource 
genes, which is the organization's own unique, long-term accumulation, the most valuable resource. 
Perspective of big organization wants us to focus on the really important things. This is the 
organization's wisdom. 
 
3.2 Big organization’s concept 
Big organization’s concept consists of: the purpose of organization’s structure is innovation; 
organization’s activities are cantered on flow of information; breaking the traditional organization’s 
structure; structure that encourage self-running and blurring organization’s boundaries. 
What big organization’s concept requires us is having innovation as target, promoting structure that 
encourage self-running, getting value promotion driven by information flow. Wisdom of organization is 
embodied here.     
 
3.3 Big organization’s platform 
Big organization’s platform is a big organization platform ecosystem. This platform Ecosystem refers 
to a serious of close organizations form a organic system that is advantages Complementing, resource 
sharing, value co-creating and core competency upgrading together via a platform, in form of Virtual, 
coalition etc., and by mechanism of linking ecosystem.  
Several terms within big organization platform ecosystem are as follows: 
Platform – It is one of many organizations connected to the place or the environment. It can be an 
452
intermediary service organization, a web site, a multilateral market, or even virtual. 
Platform ecosystem members – are including producers, suppliers, competitors and other 
stakeholders. 
Platform ecosystem composition – it is composed of a few core enterprises and numerous in-between 
enterprises. Core enterprises are the master and cornerstone of the ecosystem. The in-between 
enterprises are often collaborators and in a subordinate position. 
Big organization platform ecosystem is shown in Figure 2.1. 
1. Core enterprises build platform  
2. In-between enterprises are close to platform  
3. Different types of enterprises all survive in platform 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2.1 Big organization platform ecosystem  
The operation of big organization platform ecosystem is based on the core business - the system 
leader taking specific actions to affect the health of the whole ecosystem functioning; establish and 
maintain a connected ecosystem, including operation mechanism, sharing mechanism, value creation 
mechanism, through the platform ecosystem leading companies and their partners together to complete. 
Big organization platform ecosystem is a revolution. It changes the mode of competition - the future 
of competition is not competition between individual enterprises, but confrontation from one to another 
platform ecosystems; more and more assets of enterprises are located outside the boundaries. The 
success of a single enterprise need to rely on others, rely on the platform ecosystem it is in, namely the 
development of a business bigly depends on the organization’s ability to connect with the ecosystem. 
Big organization platform ecosystem allows us to rely on the power of platform ecosystem, bring our 
own core competitiveness with other complementary strengths together to create a higher value and 
achieve co-existence and development. This is the organization's wisdom.

  Borderless learning - knowledge flow and information flow lead to learning behavior, learning 
behavior brings innovation, and intelligent body learns and innovates driven by the flow of information; 
Clustering effect - this cluster effect comes from gravity if various enterprises. The gravitational 
attraction is mainly for the resource, reputation, culture, value, system and personalized authority. Big 
organization’s gravitational attraction creates big organization. 
Big organization’s mode of operation - learning mode without borders and clustering effect. It is how 
organization learns and innovates through knowledge flow and information flow, and attracts excellent 
resources and talents into the organization through gravity. This is the organization's wisdom. 
 
3.5 Big organization theory 
Big organization theory includes five basic theories: active management theory-leading customers; 
and culture entropy deduction theory- negative culture entropy; and humanistic ecology theory- 
inspiring humanity, and circuit theory- a virtuous circle, and collaborative innovation theory- 
collaborating innovation stakeholders.  
All of these five basic theories are based on big organization’s platform— big organization platform 
ecosystem and its purpose is to let platform ecosystem and organizations inside more powerful.  
What the five basic theories of big organization really say is that we should lead customer, inspire 
humanity, collaborate innovation stakeholders and form a virtuous circle. It’s the intelligence of 
organization we are talking about.  
 
4 Big organization culture entropy reduction theory 
Big organization culture entropy reduction theory refers to such situation that the innovative abilities 
of enterprise (organization individual or smart body) are enhanced when the entropy flux gained on the 
Platform Ecosystem of the big organization promotes the increase of negative entropy. Therefore, the 
culture management of organizational culture system is a process of entropy deduction, which makes it 
necessary to gain more entropy flux from the Platform ecosystem of big organization to promote the 
increase of culture negative entropy in organizational culture system. 
 
4.1 The significance of culture entropy change 
What cultural entropy of the system revealed is the situation of effective energy in the system. As an 
open system far from equilibrium , one organization exchanges energy, material and information with 
the environment constantly, and the cultural entropy of the organization therefore keeps changing 
continuously, namely, cultural entropy change. The trends of this change will determine the direction of 
evolution and development of the organization.  
The change of cultural entropy includes both positive entropy change (entropy increase) and negative 
entropy change (entropy decrease). Positive and negative entropy change usually work together in the 
same system for most situation, and accompany with whole process of the movement in the system.  
 
4.2 Model of culture entropy change   
454
The organizational culture entropy can be displayed in formula 3.1 
                                                                          formula 3.1  
Where Q is the energy of various flow; V is corresponding economic value of each flow; R is a space 
state variable of organization which can be set to a constant; T is time variable of organization for 
different stages of development.  
 The culture entropy change caused by in a certain time interval is displayed in formula 3.2 
                                                                          formula 3.2 
  Where ( )c iE S  is culture entropy generated in culture system of individual    
organization; ( )c eE S  is entropy inflow from platform ecosystem. The difference between ( )c iE S  and 
( )c eE S  is the culture entropy change in a certain time interval 
  When ( ) 0cE S∆ <  ? entropy inflow is greater than entropy generated within culture system of 
individual organization . It indicates that negative entropy of individual organizational culture system is 
increasing , toward a direction of advanced order and more innovative in a growing-up status.   
  When
 ( ) 0cE S∆ > ?
  entropy inflow is less than entropy generated within culture system of 
individual organization. It indicates that positive entropy of individual organizational culture system is 
increasing , toward a direction of recession in disorder and confusion status. 
  When
 ( ) 0cE S∆ = ?
  entropy inflow equals to entropy generated within culture system of individual 
organization. At this moment, the organization is in a unusual state of equilibrium under which the 
degree of order may either increase or decrease, and may even perish.  
 
5 Big organization collaborative innovation theory  
  Big organization collaborative innovation theory means coordinating innovative stakeholders. Each 
organizational individual – innovation stakeholder in big organization’s platform ecosystem gather 
innovative resources and elements effectively and realize cooperation at a higher level by breaking 
through the barriers between the innovation subjects and fully releasing the energy of innovative 
elements such as talent, capital, information and technology. The realization of collaborative innovation 
is by mechanisms of recourses sharing, advantages complementation, joint inputs and risk-sharing 
mechanisms to carry out open collaborative innovation, improve innovation capabilities and innovation 
efficiency, bring customers benefits and contribute the development of whole industry. That is, taking 
both social effect and industrial effect into account.  A collaborative innovation model is constructed in 
this paper.

5.1 Parametric design of collaborative innovation model    
  Parametric is defined as follows? 
  iP  is social effect enterprise i  brings to customers.  
  iQ  is industrial effect enterprise i  brings to other enterprises by innovation.   
  
ijB is degree of innovation achievement and innovation value sharing between enterprise i  and 
enterprise j . If two enterprises is the supply chain relationship, the degree of achievement sharing is 
high; if there is no business dealing, the degree of achievement sharing is small, even zero. 
  
ijG is degree of innovative idea and information of new technology sharing between enterprise i and 
enterprise j . If the relation between these two enterprises is direct competition, sharing degree of 
information 
ijG  is small; if enterprise i  and enterprise j  are strategic partners, sharing degree of 
information 
ijG   is high. 
ij?  is time scale difference of innovation between enterprise i  and enterprise j . ij?  measures how 
long it takes enterprise j  to finish the same innovation after enterprise i  finished it. It takes a 
development cycle as standard, the range of
 ij?  is -90< ij? <90. 
i?  is the time for enterprise i  to innovate. 
iU  is status of enterprise i . The value of iU  is related to industrial efficiency iQ and social efficiency. 
iP and is the basis for calculating iP and iQ . 
 
4.2 Collaborative innovation model 
Collaborative innovation model is shown in formula 4.1 
           
                            
formula 4.1
  
 
            
                             
 
Since it is difficult to calculate the direct social effect and industrial effect, a dummy node i
 U i?  is 
set as a benchmark in the complex network to measure the state of the industry. Node i
 U i?  is the zero 
456
state of innovation stakeholder node PQ . It’s a balanced node. Based on this, we could calculate the 
node PQ . Calculation process is: set different innovation stakeholders state iU  and jU . Value of 
ij? can be get from innovation time difference. Innovation stakeholders’ social effect and industrial 
effect can be obtained upon 
ijB  and ijG set according to relation between innovation stakeholders. 
Model 4.1 points out that the value of Gij  directly affects social benefits and sector benefits. Large 
Gij  can lead to increasing benefits of the entire industry and the entire social growth. Bij reflects big 
organization’s impact on businesses. Only strengthening the inter-agent association within big 
organization and enhancing the strategic partnership between enterprises can jointly promote the 
development of the entire industry, and bring more social benefits, so that each agent can be improved.
