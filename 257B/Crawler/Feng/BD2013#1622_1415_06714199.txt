Abstract— Grid computing is evolving fast, with specific 
needs for computing power, storage capacity and available 
bandwidth.  Network security is a big concern for grid networks 
because attacks can endanger the availability of grid usual 
services. High amounts of data transferred between sites can 
make difficult the traffic analysis needed to identify possible 
cyber-attacks. This paper presents some aspects about network 
specific security improvements done in RO-LCG and how 
existing open-source tools can be used to gather, analyze and 
discover relevant information about what is happening within the 
network.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Grid technology is making big contribution to scientific 
research, helping scientists around the world to store and 
analyze massive amounts of data.  There are hundreds of 
thousands of servers used in grid for computing power in 
various domains like: biology, earth science, high-energy 
physics, engineering, arts and social science [1]. For example, 
for the project Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN [2] a 
collaboration entity called Worldwide LHC Computing Grid 
(WLCG) was created, with more than 170 grid sites in about 
40 countries [3].  
 
 
Figure 1. Romanian grid sites 
 
In Romania, the contribution to WLCG is represented by 
RO-LCG, a federation of tier 2 grid sites located at member 
institutions [4]. Figure 1 shows each RO-LCG grid site 
contribution related to processing power (CPU). RO-LCG 
provides about 99% of Romanian grid production [4]. For 
each site, monitoring software in place tests the functionality 
of the most important grid services such as computing 
element, storage element and BDII (Berkeley Database 
Information Index). 
A generic grid infrastructure is divided in four layers, two 
layers for the hardware-centric part (Network layer and 
Resource layer) and other two on top of them for the user-
 centric part (Middleware layer and Application layer). The 
architecture of a grid site is depicted in Figure 2. In every grid 
site there is installed a middleware responsible for the 
management of all resources provided by the resource layer. A 
number of services are provided by this layer, such as job 
management, authentication, authorization, and security. These 
services are: 
• Computing Element (CE) [1], is responsible for jobs 
management within the site, CPU and memory resources 
allocation, work nodes monitoring and access rights; 
• Storage Element (SE), is responsible for managing disk 
space, data access rights depending on which organization 
the user belongs and file management; 
• User Interface (UI), is responsible for jobs to be executed 
submission, job cancelling, copying and deleting files from 
the grid system and retrieving the output of finished jobs; 
• Work nodes (WN), are responsible for the management 
and execution of jobs within the server. 
 
 
Figure 2. Generic grid site architecture 
 
The grid sites are interconnected using national or 
continental education networks (see Figure 2). As in 
networking, to have the same advantages of separating 
functions and allowing the independent evolution of 
technologies, the proposed model is organized in layers, 
starting with hardware-centric and ending with user-centric 
layers. 
 
Since the grid sites are interconnected it is possible that 
they are exposed to cyber-attacks. In this paper, we will 
describe the monitoring process of cyber-attacks in the national 
grid sites that helps us to improve the security level and to fix 
some problems. 
II. NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE 
Data communication between RO-LCG sites and with other 
WLCG members is done using RoEduNet (Romanian 
Education Network) infrastructure. RoEduNet is the name of 
the Romanian National Research and Education Network 
(NREN), which participates with other NRENs in forming the 
pan-European GEANT network  [5]. 
RoEduNet uses optical fiber and DWDM equipment to 
provide needed capacity parameters for data circuits. Data is 
passed through the optical network using routing equipment 
installed in Network Operation Centers (NOCs). This 
equipment is interconnected with multiple 10 Gbps circuits 
(and 100 Gbps lambdas) to achieve redundancy. 
Figure 3 shows the relevant part of RoEduNet network 
(area surrounded with dashed line) and existing Romanian grid 
sites, members or not of RO-LCG.  
 
Figure 3. RoEduNet and Romanian grid sites 
 
Connectivity between GRID sites and RoEduNet NOCs is 
done using optical fiber. In Bucharest NOCs (labeled as NAT 
and BUC in Figure 3) and Cluj NOC (CLU), GRID sites were 
connected within the metropolitan area, while in Iasi NOC 
(IAS) the RO-16-UAIC site is co-located within RoEduNet Iasi 
NOC datacenter. 
Recently RoEduNet DWDM network was extended from 
Bucharest NOC to Magurele (MAG) sites, using a point of 
presence installed at IFIN-HH premises. Using DWDM 
technology, available capacity for sites connected to MAG can 
be easily increased as needed, with costs covering new 
transponders procurement and installation. 
Upstream communication is done using the connection 
between RoEduNet border router and Bucharest GEANT POP 
[5], both installed in RoEduNet datacenter at NOC NAT. 
Data traffic of GRID sites uses same physical infrastructure 
as other institutions connected to RoEduNet. In November 
2012 RoEduNet joined LHCONE network  [6] which aims to 
connect CERN LHC project sites within at least a logically 
separated network. Traffic separation is done using the so-
 called L3 VPN with VRF technology (VPN Routing and 
Forwarding)  [7]. VRF technology implies the use of an MPLS 
core, a separate forwarding table within the routing equipment 
and some way to classify the traffic as “interesting”, e.g. to be 
routed via dedicated LHCONE VRF. The decision to include 
traffic into a VRF instance can be made by incoming interface 
or by source IP address. For RO-LCG sites, the solution using 
source IP addresses is used because there were no available 
separate network interfaces to connect only GRID sites to 
RoEduNet routers. Also, we wanted to avoid complicating 
existing IP addressing plans. 
Upstream connection of RoEduNet LHCONE VRF to 
GEANT uses a virtual interface configured over the 10G 
circuit between RoEduNet border router and Bucharest 
GEANT POP router. GEANT provides LHCONE traffic 
separation within its infrastructure using the same VRF 
solution. 
Figure 4 shows a rough relevant map of GEANT network 
and LHCONE connected sites1; also GEANT connections to 
other WLCG structures around the world are represented in the 
upper part of the picture.

LHCONE Meeting held in Washington on 31st January, 2013, and after some 
updates received from the author of the presentation 
(https://indico.cern.ch/getFile.py/access?contribId=1&resId=1&materialId=sli
 des&confId=212656) 
 
Inside GEANT, routing information needed for data 
transport is provided using BGP routing protocol. Each 
LHCONE national-level aggregator (e.g. NREN) announces 
into GEANT LHCONE VRF only IPv4 prefixes of LHCONE 
members within the country. 
 
III. NETWORK MONITORING  
Because the complexity and needs of LHCONE, the usual 
task of network monitoring is more important. There are many 
software tools that can ease this. Some of the tools used in 
RoEduNet for network monitoring are NMIS  [8], Cacti  [9], 
and  NfSen/nfdump [10]. 
Cacti is a solution for network graphing based on 
information collected using various acquisition methods. The 
information is stored in RRD  [11] and can be visualized using 
an intuitive web interface. Network traffic values, equipment 
environmental parameters, server’s resources usage are some 
examples of graphs that can be obtained using Cacti tool. 
Figure 5 show traffic statistics for the Romanian LHCONE 
community since LHCONE setup is in production. Figure 5 a) 
shows network traffic as it is seen from RoEduNet side and it is 
taken from a Cacti instance running at RoEduNet network 
management system (NMS), while Figure 5 b) is from GEANT 
NMS. 
 
Figure 5. a) RO-LCG traffic - RoEduNet monitored b) RO-LCG 
traffic – GEANT monitored 
 
Because of the data sampling used for these graphs (once 
per day at 3:00 am) traffic seems to be not so big. Average 
values are calculated for the entire span of time covered by the 
graph that means one year. 
An increase of traffic may be observed at the beginning of 
July, when sites from Magurele were connected to RoEduNet 
LHCONE VRF, after installing a new router in MAG 
RoEduNet site (Figure 3).  
One of the widely used sets of tools for network traffic 
tracking and for network security incidents handling in NREN 
community is NfSen/nfdump. These tools are based on 
netflow. 
Netflow  [12] is a protocol used to collect information 
about IP traffic. Network equipment that supports netflow can 
export so-called netflow records to a data collecting system 
where information will be stored and analyzed. Netflow 
records are exported using UDP, each record has relevant 
information about flows passed through exporting equipment. 
Such information is ingress and egress interfaces, source and 
destination IPv4/IPv6 address, source and destination ports for 
TCP or UDP, type of service, next-hop and other, but no user 
data is present. 
Nfdump is the basis of NfSen/nfdump suite, collecting and 
storing flow information exported by routing equipment. It is 
also capable to generate various traffic statistics from gathered 
data, beginning with plain flow listing and going to various top 
N statistics, being able to do filtering of displayed information 
according to the analysis needs of the operator. 
Nfsen is in fact a frontend with web interface that facilitates 
drawing graphs from captured data and generate alerts if 
specified conditions are met. Current network traffic or specific 
profiled graphics can be created. Figure 6 is an example for the 
NfSen web interface used at RoEduNet, showing information 
for a specific profile created for Romanian grid sites. 
 
Figure 6. NfSen web interface 
 
The Figure 6 displays network traffic and traffic values for 
each site, while at the bottom part of the picture there are some 
tools to generate reports based on pre-configured or user-based 
filters. Displayed information can be an overview of all 
collected traffic information or generated using profiles. A 
profile can contain filters reassembling to those used with 
tcpdump, such as matching a host, a network prefix, a TCP or 
UDP port, protocol or combinations of these. 
 
IV. (RESULTS) 
Using network monitoring tools, it can be observed that 
between RO-LCG and WLCG there is traffic varying between 
generous values, going up to 10 Gbps. To make a detailed 
analysis for this traffic it is necessary a big storage space and 
powerful servers. One good solution for this problem is to use 
the NfSen/nfdump tools.       
Using the described NfSen/nfdump suite, traffic tracking 
and analysis can be done for RO-LCG sites (Figure 7). In this 
a) 
b) 
graph the network traffic of the sites is represented in logarithm 
scale because we want to visualize the traffic per institution. 
Sites located at Magurele are all shown as IFIN because they 
use IP addresses from one /24 prefix. Correlating Figure 7 with 
Figure 1, it can be observed that the traffic is proportional with 
computing power available to each institution.

Before Romania sites were part of LHCONE network all 
the grid traffic was send only to France because RO-LCG was 
connected to Tier-1 grid infrastructure called ATLAS 
FRANCE CLOUD. Now it is possible to transfer information 
to all Tier-1 and Tier-2 sites. A top n statistic of RO-LCG 
ATLAS sites is presented in the Tabel 1.

traffic in the Romanian LHCONE  
 
It is difficult to analyze the traffic of a grid site because it is 
not uniform (see Figure 6) and may be compared with a cyber-
 attack like distributed denial-of-service attack (DDOS). As a 
first stage, tracing and removal of the rightful known traffic 
from total traffic (Figure 8 a) is needed. To remove the 
legitimate traffic we configured a new profile in NfSen and we 
select traffic that does not use known TCP or UDP ports in grid 
technology. With this mechanism the amount of information to 
be analyzed is greatly reduced and thus we may find easier the 
traffic outside of WLCG scope, as it can be seen in Figure 8 
a) 
b) 
For example we analyzed the top traffic between Sep 10 
2013 - 15:30 - Sep 10 2013 - 19:20 and we found that 52.5% 
of Magurele traffic (Figure 8 b) is on port 53 (~400K packets) 
and have suspect requests coming from IP addresses registered 
in United States, Netherlands, Finland, Denmark, Spain, 
Kazakhstan, Syria and others that could indicate an attack 
method similar to the one that uses open recursive resolvers. 
 
In the top traffic between Sep 15 2013 - 13:40 - Sep 15 
2013 - 22:05 we identified an possible brute force attack from 
United States to RO-16-UAIC, from Pakistan to RO-14-ITIM 
and from China and Germany to NIPNE.  
 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
This article describes the research and education network 
from Romania and the services offered for RO-LCG grid 
community, such as LHCONE access used to connect CERN 
LHC project sites within at least a logically separated network. 
Another service offered by RoEduNet is Network Monitoring 
that helps grid sites to get traffic statistics and warnings about 
various attacks. 
This paper presents a method to analyze the Romania 
LHCONE traffic and identify two possible cyber-attacks: brute 
force attack and open recursive resolvers attack.
