ABSTRACT 
Sensors of diverse capabilities and modalities, carried by 
us or deeply embedded in the physical world, have invaded 
our personal, social, work, and urban spaces. A big enabler 
have been mobile phones that we always carry and which 
have diverse sensors embedded in them or wirelessly 
connected to them. Our relationship with these sensors is a 
complicated one. On the one hand, these sensors collect rich 
data that are shared and disseminated, often initiated by us, 
with a broad array of service providers, interest groups, 
friends, and family. Embedded in this data is information 
that can be used to algorithmically construct a virtual 
biography of our activities, revealing intimate behaviors and 
lifestyle patterns. On the other hand, we increasingly depend 
directly and indirectly on information originating from these 
sensors for making a variety of decisions, both routine and 
critical, in our lives. The quality of these decisions and our 
confidence in them depend directly on the quality of the 
sensory information and our trust in the sources.  
Drawing upon examples of this two-faceted relationship 
with sensors from our work in applications such as mobile 
health and sustainable buildings, this talk will discuss the 
challenges inherent in designing a sensor information flow 
and processing architecture that is sensitive to the concerns 
of both producers and consumers. For the pervasive sensing 
infrastructure to be trusted by both, it must support a 
privacy-utility trade-off that balances the tension between 
risk of information sharing to the producer and the value of 
information sharing to the consumer.  
The talk will describe an approach to enabling this trade-
 off based on interpreting privacy and utility in terms of 
inferences that are allowed or prohibited, and supported by 
mechanisms for controlled transformation of the quality of 
information via selective obfuscation driven by statistical 
models of individual behaviors, and robust fusion of 
information of uncertain quality and obfuscation from 
sensors of varied trustworthiness. The design of a context-
 aware privacy-preserving sensing stack for Android-based 
mobile phones will also be presented.
