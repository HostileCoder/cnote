 Abstract—This paper develops an algorithm that can be used
 to solve the data association problem faced by a surveillance
 aircraft using Direction of Arrival angle measurements to locate
 a stationary RF signal source. The algorithm is based on statisti-
 cal clustering of measurements with clusters being formed using
 a Mahalanobis distance association criterion. This approach
 accounts for angle measurement error statistics and avoids the
 computational complexity of an exhaustive combinatorial as-
 signment. The optimal cluster is the one that maximized the
 target position log-likelihood function. This cluster is used to
 compute a target position estimate then removed from the set
 of measurements. The process is repeated until no additional
 clusters can be formed. Simulation results are shown where 100
 measurements are distributed randomly across 7 target signal
 sources.

 1. INTRODUCTION
 Passive geo-location of ground targets is commonly per-
 formed by surveillance aircraft using Direction Finding (DF)
 angles. These angles define the line-of-sight from the aircraft
 to the target and are computed using the response of an
 antenna array on the aircraft to the target’s RF emissions.
 Aircraft that depend entirely upon DF angles for geo-location
 will often convert each DF angle measurement to a Direction
 of Arrival (DOA) angle measurement and use these values
 for geo-location. DOA is the angle equivalent to azimuth
 or Angle of Arrival (AOA) when defined relative to a local-
 level coordinate frame at the current aircraft position. DOA is
 computed using azimuth or AOA, an estimate of the elevation

 angle to the target, the antenna array mounting angles on the
 aircraft, and aircraft navigation system output. Associated
 with each angle measurement is a Line-of-Bearing (LOB)
 that originates at the aircraft and, if perfect, passes through
 the target’s position. See reference [1] for additional DF angle
 details.
 Most geo-location scenarios faced by surveillance aircraft
 involve the existence of multiple target signal sources within
 the area of operation. As a result, each new LOB/DOA
 measurement must be correlated with a specific target emitter
 before that target’s position estimate can be updated by the
 geo-location algorithm. Geo-location performance is typi-
 cally degraded in a dense emitter environment due to the
 difficulty of correlating each LOB with the correct target,
 and of preventing the generation of numerous false or ”ghost”
 targets.
 LOB correlation for stationary targets is addressed in ref-
 erences [ 2–6]. In [5], clusters are formed by solving a
 combinatorial assignment problem with the number of sensor
 positions limited to 3 due to computational complexity. Once
 clusters are formed, the optimal cluster is defined to be the
 one that maximizes a likelihood function. In [6], clusters are
 formed using Euclidean distance between LOB intersection
 points as the metric for measurement association. The opti-
 mal cluster is then defined simply as the one having the most
 measurements. References [7–9] address LOB correlation for
 moving targets.
 This paper presents an algorithm that can be used to solve
 the LOB correlation problem for stationary targets and uses a
 geo-location simulation example to illustrate each step of the
 algorithm. The algorithm is based on statistical clustering
 of measurements but does not require that the number of
 clusters be specified in advance, as with methods such as k-
 means clustering [10]. This algorithm determines the cluster
 of LOBs that maximizes the target position log-likelihood
 function when compared to all candidate clusters. The
 candidate clusters are those that pass a Mahalanobis distance
 association criterion - an exhaustive search over all possible
 measurement combinations is not performed. Once the op-
 timal cluster of LOBs has been determined, a target position
 estimate is computed using the cluster, the cluster is removed
 from the set of all measurements, and the process is repeated.
 This continues until no additional clusters can be formed.
 2. SIMULATION EXAMPLE
 MATLAB R [11] was used to simulate the correlation algo-
 rithm developed in this paper for the following geo-location
 scenario. An aircraft is receiving RF transmissions from
 1
multiple stationary ground target emitters within its area
 of operation. The number and positions of the targets are
 unknown. The received RF transmissions will be processed
 to generate measurements of DOA, which in turn will be used
 to locate the targets. The values of the scenario parameters are
 given in the table below.
 Scenario Parameter Units Value
 aircraft speed knots 300
 collection time minutes 10
 approximate range to targets nautical miles 20
 number of targets n/a 7
 number of DOA measurements n/a 100
 DOA measurement error sigma degrees 1:5
 3. GEOMETRY
 Definitions
 We will construct a fixed plane tangent to the earth’s surface
 within the area of operation. The coordinate frame within
 this plane will have its origin at the point where the plane
 intersects the earth’s surface and will be oriented such that
 the x axis points east and the y axis points north. The aircraft
 positions will be represented in this coordinate frame by a
 gnomonic projection into the tangent plane. The DF angle
 measurements will be converted to DOA measurements in
 the local-level coordinate frame at each aircraft position, then
 converted to DOA values in the fixed tangent plane. Let ai
 be the aircraft’s 2  1 position vector in the plane for i =
 1; 2; : : : ; N , where N is the number of DOA measurements.
 We will assume that there is exactly one DOA measurement
 at each aircraft position. Let  i be the true DOA value
 at aircraft position ai for a signal transmitted from the true
 target position xi. The components of the aircraft and target
 position vectors are given by
 ai =
  
a1i
 a2i
  
(1)
 and
 xi =
  
x1i
 x2i
  
(2)
 DOA is defined as shown in Figure 1.
 Simulation Example
 TheN = 100 aircraft positions and 7 true but unknown target
 positions are shown in Figure 2.
 4. SENSOR MEASUREMENTS
 Definitions
 Let hi be the function that gives the true DOA value in terms
 of the true target position. Then from (1), (2), and Figure 1
 we see that
  i = hi (xi) = tan 1
  
x2i  a2i
 x1i  a1i
  
(3)
 Let zi be a measurement of  i. We will assume that the
 measurement errors are unbiased and Gaussian with known
 variances. As a result, we have
 zi =  i +  i = hi (xi) +  i (4)
 Figure 1. Direction of Arrival in Tangent Plane
  i  N
  
0;  2i
  
(5)
 where N represents a Gaussian distribution,  i is the mea-
 surement error, and  i is the known measurement error sigma
 value. From the above we have
 zi  N
  
hi (xi) ;  2i
  
(6)
 and therefore that
  
zi  hi (xi)

   2 (1) (7)
 where  2 (1) represents a chi-square distribution with 1 de-
 gree of freedom.
 Simulation Example
 At each of the 100 aircraft positions, a random draw was
 made to determine which of the 7 targets was transmitting
 a signal. For that aircraft position and target, the true DOA
 value was computed using (3). The measured DOA value
 was computed as in (4) and (5) using a random draw with
  = 1:5 degrees.
 The resulting DOA measurements are shown by the 100
 LOBs in Figure 3.
 5. STEP 1
 Algorithm
 The first step of the LOB correlation algorithm is to compute
 all 2-LOB intersection points within specified distances from
 the aircraft. Each 2-LOB intersection is computed as follows.
 From Figure 1 we see that the unit vector along the measured
 LOB from aircraft position ai is
 ui =
  
cos (zi)
 sin (zi)
  
(8)
 The LOBs from aircraft positions ai and aj will intersect at
 the point p such that
 p = ai + riui = aj + rjuj (9)

where ri and rj are the ranges from the aircraft positions to
 the intersection point. From the above we have
 [ ui  uj ]
  
ri
 rj
  
= (aj  ai) (10)
 and therefore that
  
ri
 rj
  
= [ ui  uj ]
  1 (aj  ai) (11)
 If either of the computed ranges falls outside of the specified
 minimum and maximum allowed values, then this intersec-
 tion point is discarded. The intersection point is computed
 using either of the computed ranges and (9). Note that
 a negative range indicates that the 2 LOBs intersect on the
 wrong side of the aircraft. We will let M be the number of
 computed intersection points.
 Simulation Example
 The 2-LOB intersection points were required to lie between
 10 and 50 nautical miles from the aircraft positions. The
 resulting M = 2651 2-LOB intersection points are shown in
 Figure 4.
 6. STEP 2
 Algorithm
 The second step of the algorithm is to determine the set of
 LOBs that can be associated with each 2-LOB intersection
 point based on Mahalanobis distance [12]. The Mahalanobis
 distance between DOA measurement zi and 2-LOB intersec-
 tion point pj is
 mij =
  
zi  hi
  
pj
  
 i
 !2
 (12)
 for i = 1; 2; : : : ; N and j = 1; 2; : : : ;M . Note from (7) that
 if pj is the true target position associated with zi, then mij
 has a  2 (1) distribution. This fact is the basis for the LOB
 association criterion. Our null hypothesis is that pj is the
 target position associated with zi. Let  be the probability
 of a Type 1 error, i.e., the probability of rejecting the null
 hypothesis when it’s true. Let k be the critical value from a
  2 (1) distribution such that
 Pr
  
 2 (1)  k
  
= 1  (13)
 The association criterion is that LOB/DOA measurement zi
 can be associated with pj if mij  k. The set of indices of
 LOBs that can be associated with pj is
 Sj = fi : mij  kg (14)
 Several facts about (14) are worth noting. One is that
 each LOB can typically be associated with numerous 2-LOB
 intersection points. Another is that the elements in each set
 Sj are not necessarily unique: Sj1 and Sj2 may contain the
 same elements for j1 6= j2. Finally, the number of elements
 in Sj , jSj j, is at least 2 for each j since 2 LOBs were used to
 compute pj . We will require that jSj j  3 in order for Sj to
 be a candidate cluster for LOB correlation.
 Simulation Example
 The value of used was 0:05, which means that k used in (13)
 and (14) is the 95% critical value from a  2 (1) distribution.
 Of the 2651 2-LOB intersection points, 2644 produced a
 candidate cluster for LOB correlation.
 7. STEP 3
 Algorithm
 The third step of the algorithm is to determine which of the
 candidate clusters gives the largest log-likelihood function
 value when the LOBs in that cluster are combined to compute
 a target position estimate. Let Sj be a candidate cluster
 and let z be the vector containing all zi such that i 2 Sj .
 We will assume that all such zi are associated with the same
 true target position x. Using (6) gives that the conditional
 probability density function for the measurements given the
 target position x is
 f (z j x) =

 This value can be found numerically using Iterated Least-
 Squares [1]. The log-likelihood function value associated
 with candidate cluster Sj is
 lj = ln (f (z j x^)) (17)
 The cluster giving the largest log-likelihood function value is
 Sjmax , where
 jmax = argmax

 lj (18)
 Simulation Example
 Of the 2644 candidate clusters, 15 achieved the maximum
 log-likelihood function value. These 15 clusters all contained
 the same 20 LOBs. The optimal LOB cluster is shown in
 Figure 5.
 8. STEP 4
 Algorithm
 The fourth step of the algorithm is to compute a target
 position estimate (16) using the optimal LOB cluster, then
 remove the LOBs from the set of all measurements. Note
 that the position estimate has already been computed as an
 intermediate step in determining the log-likelihood function
 value (17).
 Simulation Example
 The target position estimate for the optimal cluster and the
 95% confidence error ellipse are shown in Figure 6. The 20
 LOBs in the optimal cluster have been removed.

 9. REMAINING STEPS
 Algorithm
 The remaining steps of the algorithm involve repeating steps
 1-4 above until no additional LOB clusters are formed.
 Simulation Example
 The final target position estimates and 95% confidence error
 ellipses are shown in Figures 7 and 8. Note that 1 LOB was
 not assigned to a cluster and 1 error ellipse did not contain the
 true target position.
 10. SUMMARY
 The purpose of this paper was to present an algorithm that can
 be used to solve the LOB correlation problem for stationary
 targets. LOB clusters were formed using a Mahalanobis
 distance association criterion. This approach accounts for
 angle measurement error statistics and avoids the computa-
 tional complexity of an exhaustive combinatorial assignment.
 Once clusters were formed, the optimal cluster was defined to
 be the one that maximized the target position log-likelihood
 function. This cluster was used to compute a target position
 estimate then removed from the set of measurements. The
 process was repeated until no additional clusters could be
 formed. The algorithm was shown to provide good corre-
 lation and geo-location performance in a scenario where 100
 LOBs were distributed randomly across 7 targets.
