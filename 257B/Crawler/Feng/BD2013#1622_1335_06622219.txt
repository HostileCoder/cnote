ABSTRACT 
The advent of sensor technologies and imaging 
modalities has greatly increased our abilit y to map 
the brain structure and understand its cognitive function. 
In order for the acquired Big Data (with large volume, 
wide variety, and high velocity) to be valuable, innovative 
data-centric algorithms and systems in machine learning, 
data mining and artificial in telligence have been 
developed, designed and implemented. Due t 0 the 
complexity of the brain system and its co gnitive 
processes, new data-driven paradigm is needed to 
recognize patterns in Big Data, to fuse information from 
different sources (systems and se nsors), and to extract 
useful knowledge for actionable decisions. 
In this talk, I will focus on the notion of "Cognition 
diversity" which provides a new paradigm to measure the 
"dissimilarity" or "difference", between two objects or 
subjects at both the levels of variable (feature, cue, 
parameter, modality, indicator) and system 
(classification, regression, associate rule and cluste ring; 
decision trees, naIve Bayes, k-NN, neural nets, SVM and 
other kernel methods). We compare cognitive diversity to 
the three statistical co rrelations (Pearson, Kendall and 
Spearman). We also discuss the relation of cognitive 
diversity to other goodness-of-fit tests ( e.g. the 
Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). It can be emphasized that 
cognitive diversity is u seful in unsupervised machine 
learning and decision making environments where the 
true fact or optimal decision is not known or cannot be 
obtained until it happens. 
Among other applications, we discuss three 
examples: (1) com bining two visual perception and 
cognition systems using confidence radius and cognitive 
diversity, (2) feature selection and combination for stress 
detection and affectiv e computing using ph ysiological 
sensors, and (3) combinatorial fusion of five sensor stress 
detection algorithms: C4.5, NaIve Bayes (N B), Linear 
Discriminate Function (LDF), SVM and K-nearest 
neighbors (k-NN) across a variety of feat ure 
sets selected by C4.5, PC A, correlation-based and 
diversity-based feature and selection methods.

Dr. Hsu's current research focuses on network 
interconnection and communication, informatics and 
intelligent computing, and co mbinatorial fusion with 
applications in_bioinformatics, neuroinformatics, 
cognitive informatics and computing, virtual screening, 
information retrieval, predictive analytics, and health 
informatics. Dr. Hsu is a Sen ior member of IEEE, a
