 ABSTRACT
 This paper addresses the problem of automatic extraction of
 built-up areas from high-resolution remote sensing images.
 We propose a new building presence index from the point
 view of perception. We argue that built-up areas usually
 result in significant corners and junctions in high-resolution
 satellite images, due to the man-made structures and occlu-
 sion, and thus can be measured by the geometrical structures
 they contained. More precisely, we first detect corners and
 junctions by relying on a perception-inspired corner detector,
 called an a-contrario junction detector. Each detected cor-
 ner is associated with a perceptual significance, which mea-
 sures the structural saliency of the corner in the image and
 is independent of the contrast and scale. All these detected
 corners together with their significance are then used to com-
 pute the building index. The proposed approach is evaluated
 on a high-resolution satellite image set, including 15 big im-
 ages from GeoEye-1, QuickBird and IKONOS. The results
 demonstrated that our method achieves the state-of-the-art re-
 sults and can be used in practical applications.

 1. INTRODUCTION
 The detection of built-up areas is a dynamic and challeng-
 ing problem in remote sensing. High resolution satellite im-
 ages provide rich information and enable accurate locating of
 built-up areas. However, manual administration of these areas
 from huge images is time consuming and unfeasible, thus au-
 tomatic approaches are demanded to detect the built-up area
 from aerial and satellite images.
 In the last decade, a large number of automatic built-up area
 detection approaches have been reported [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8],
 which can be roughly divided into two categories. The first
 category of such methods rely on supervised classification.
 More precisely, they use a large set of specific training sam-
 ples to learn the feature distribution of built-up areas for de-
 tection, see [1, 2]. The second category of methods directly
 detect built-up areas without using any training data. It in-
 cludes the approaches using local key point features [3, 4, 7],
 contrast measure of texture features (e.g. PanTex using the
 gray-level co-occurrence matrix [6]) and the difference of
 morphological profiles [8].

 corresponds to hight level).
 This paper addresses the problem of unsupervised auto-
 matic extraction of built-up areas, inspired by a perception
 guided approach, named an a-contrario junction (ACJ) de-
 tector [9, 10], which extracts significant and meaningful ge-
 ometric structures in natural images and is robust to textures.
 The main idea is that built-up areas usually result in signifi-
 cant geometric structures (e.g. corners and junctions) in high-
 resolution satellite images, due to their man-made character-
 istics and occlusions, and thus can be indexed and measured
 by the local geometrical structures they contained. More pre-
 cisely, given an image, we first apply the ACJ detector to find
 all perceptually significant geometrical structures, each of
 which is associated with a significance measuring its saliency
 in the image. The significance of local structures is then prop-
 agated to the whole image by using a spatial kernel, in order
 to compute a built-up area presence index, named perceptual
 building index (PBI) for short. It is worth noticing that the
 PBI is independent of local image contrast, meaning that it
 detects white and black built-up areas equivalently. As we
 shall see in Section 2, PBI achieves the state-of-the-art results
 on built-up area detection.

In the rest of this paper, we first briefly recall the ACJ de-
 tector in Section 2, detail the computation of the perceptual
 building index in Section 3, then illustrate experiments in Sec-
 tion 4 and finally conclude in Section 5.
 2. AN A-CONTRARIO JUNCTION DETECTOR
 This section briefly recall the accurate and contrast invariant
 junction detector, named ACJ, originally introduced by Xia
 et. al. [10, 9]. A junction | is represented by its center p, its
 scale r 2 N and a set of M branch directions f 1; : : :  Mg
 around p. M is the order of the junction. We consider M =
 2; 3, corresponding to corners and T-(or Y-) junctions. More
 precisely, given a gray-scale image I on discrete image lattice
  and denote the gradient as rI = (Ix; Iy). We define the
 direction  (q) of a pixel q as the direction perpendicular to
 the gradient at q, i.e.  (q) = (arctan Iy(q)Ix(q) +
  
2 )mod(2 ).
 The ACJ detector relies on the a-contrario detection the-
 ory [11], who states that meaningful events are those whose
 probabilities of occurrence under some null hypothesis H0 is
 small enough. In the context of junction detection, the null
 hypothesis is defined as follows. Denoting I a random im-
 age, kfrI(q)k and  I(q) the random variables corresponding
 to the contrast and orientation at each pixel q, we say that
 these variables follow the null hypothesis H0 if (1) 8q 2  ,
 kfrI(q)k follows a Rayleigh distribution with parameter 1;
 (2) 8q 2  ,  I(q) is uniformly distributed over [0; 2 ] ; (3)
 the family fkfrI(q)k,  I(q)gq2 is made up of independent
 random variables.
 Let | be a junction in a random image I where normal-
 ized gradients and directions are assumed to follow H0. The
 strength of the junction | is defined as
 t(|) := minm=1:::M !p(r;  m); (1)
 where ! is the strength of a branch Sp(r;  ) as !p(r;  ) =
 P
 q2Sp(r; )
  p(q); and  p(q) = kfrI(q)k  (j cos( (q)  
 ( !pq))j  j sin( (q)  ( !pq))j).
 Under the hypothesis H0, the probability that the random
 variable t(|) is larger than a given threshold t finally is
 F|(t) := PH0 [t(|)  t] =
 QM
 m=1
 R +1
 t ?
 J(r; m)
 j=1  (dz); (2)
 where J(r;  m) is the size of a sector of orientation  m at
 scale r.
 Each junction | is associated with a significant level called
 number of false alarms (NFA)
 NFA(|) := #J (M)  F|(t(|)); (3)
 where #J (M) is the number of test in an image. Observe
 that the smaller the NFA is, the more meaningful the junction
 |, thus we use  log(NFA) as the significance of the junction.
 Notice that, in practice, a single junction can be detected at
 multiple scales and multiple locations with slight differences.
 These redundancies are removed by relying on an exclusion
 principle, called maximality. A simple example is shown in
 Figure 1.

 3. PERCEPTUAL BULIT-UP INDEX
 We argue that around junction structures, especially corners
 and T-junctions, a built-up area can be found with a high prob-
 ability. Let J :
  
|; | = fq; r; f mgg
  
be the list of detected
 junctions in a gray-level image I . We define the built-up area
 presence index, i.e. perceptual building index (PBI), of a pixel
 p 2  in the image I , as
 PBI(p) =
 X
 q|; |2J
  log(NFA(|))  Gr(p;q|); (4)
 where G (p;q) = e
  
kp qk22
 2 2 is a Gaussian kernel with size
 of  , in order to propagate the saliency of the junction | at
 q to the pixels p around q. Observe that this propagation
 kernel is similar to that in [7], called spatial voting, where
  is estimated by using morphological operations. However
 in our case, we simply take  = 5r, with r as the scale of
 junction.
 To obtain a detection map of the built-up areas, we can
 threshold the PBI values. For instance, in this paper, we sim-
 ply take the threshold as the mean of the PBI in the image.
 One could also use an adaptive threshold, similar to [7]. See
 Figure 1 for an example.
 4. EXPERIMENTAL ANALYSIS
 In order to evaluate our method, we test the proposed PBI on
 a set of high-resolution satellite images, including 5 GeoEye-
 1 images, 5 IKONOS images and 5 QuickBird images. The
 smallest image is with size of 2000 3000 pixels.
 Figure 2 shows two GeoEye-1 images in the testing set.
 Figure 3 compares the results of PBI with those of two state-
 of-the-art methods, i.e. the Modified Harris for Edges and
 Corners (MHEC) [7] and the morphological building index
 (MBI) [8]. In Figure 3, the color indicates the confident level
 of built-up areas, with red corresponding to high level and
 blue corresponding to low level. Notice that the proposed PBI
 avoids non-urban textures and focuses more on built-up areas,
 comparing with the other two approaches. In order to achieve
 a detection of built-up areas, a threshold is applied to the PBI
 indexes. For PBI, the threshold is set to be the mean of the
 PBI values in each image. While the parameters of MHEC
 and MBI are selected according to their original references [7]
 and [8]. One can observe that the detection results by PBI are
 with less false alarms and more correct detections. Figure 3
 demonstrates similar results on the GeoEye-1 France image.
 Both MHEC and MBI have heavy responses in texture areas.
 It is mainly because MHEC relies on edge information and

 pixels; Right: GeoEye-1 images in France, with size of 3200 2300.
 MBI use texture features. More results and the full-resolution
 version of the images in this paper can be found at http:
 //dsp.whu.edu.cn/cn/staff/yw/PBI.html.
 It is also worth noticing that the running time of the PBI on
 a 3000  2000 image is about 5 seconds, which is much less
 that those of MHEC and MBI.
 5. CONCLUSION
 This paper has proposed a perception-inspired building pres-
 ence index for built-up area extraction in high-resolution
 satellite images. It is based on a probabilistic perception the-
 ory (i.e. a-contrario methodology) and benefits from a robust
 and contrast invariant junction detector (i.e. the ACJ detec-
 tor). Moreover, the proposed method is free of parameter and
 fully automatic. Although the experimental results demon-
 strate that PBI achieves the state-of-the-art results on built-up
 area detection, a potential extension is to take into account
 more powerful perception rules, such as parallel lines. The
 fast computation of PBI also enables us to use it for practical
 applications.
