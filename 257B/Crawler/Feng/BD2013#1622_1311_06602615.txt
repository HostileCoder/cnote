Big Data: Unleashing Information 
James M. Tien 
University of Miami, USA 
Abstract—At present, it is projected that about 4 zettabytes (or 10**21 bytes) of 
electronic data are being generated per year by everything from underground 
physics experiments to retail transactions to security cameras to global 
positioning systems. In the U. S., major research programs are being funded to 
deal with big data in all five economic sectors (i.e., services, manufacturing, 
construction, agriculture and mining) of the economy. Big Data is a term applied 
to data sets whose size is beyond the ability of available tools to undertake their 
acquisition, access, analytics and/or application in a reasonable amount of time. 
Whereas Tien (2003) forewarned about the data rich, information poor (DRIP) 
problems that have been pervasive since the advent of large-scale data collections 
or warehouses, the DRIP conundrum has been somewhat mitigated by the Big 
Data approach which has unleashed information in a manner that can support 
informed - yet, not necessarily defensible or knowledgeable - decisions or choices. 
Thus, by somewhat overcoming data quality issues with data quantity, data 
access restrictions with on-demand cloud computing, causative analysis with 
correlative data analytics, and model-driven with evidence-driven applications, 
appropriate actions can be undertaken with the obtained information. New 
acquisition, access, analytics and application technologies are being developed to 
further Big Data as it is being employed to help resolve the 14 grand challenges 
(identified by the National Academy of Engineering in 2008), underpin the 10 
breakthrough technologies (compiled by the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology in 2013) and support the Third Industrial Revolution of mass 
customization.
