Abstract— The Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP) mission is 
part of NASA’s Living With a Star Program, and launched 
August 30, 2012. The fundamental goal of the mission is to 
provide an understanding, ideally to the point of predictability, 
of how populations of relativistic electrons and penetrating 
ions in space form or change in response to variable inputs of 
energy from the Sun.  The mission consists of two nearly-
 identical observatories launched into highly-elliptical Earth 
orbits, as well as the ground and data systems necessary to 
return and distribute science and housekeeping data and 
provide command and control of the space systems.  The two 
observatories launched aboard a single Atlas V 401 launch 
vehicle, and were placed in orbits that cause one observatory to 
lap the other approximately four times per year.  This mission 
design enables an investigation of both spatial and temporal 
effects within the radiation belts using only two observatories, 
and the two year science mission allows an investigation of all 
local time positions and interaction regions.  Each Observatory 
contains a suite of instruments to study ions, electrons and the 
local magnetic and electric fields.  An overview of the RBSP 
mission is presented with an emphasis on the fault 
management system design.  The goal of the RBSP fault 
management system is to be as simple as possible while 1) 
ensuring that the observatory is capable of detecting, 
correcting, and recovering from any single, recoverable 
anomaly that affects the health and safety of the observatory 
and 2) the observatory meets the overall mission concept and 
mission goals.  Five high-level requirements that define the 
fault management redundancy, modes/safing, and ground 
intervention concepts will be presented to demonstrate that 
despite using a relatively simple architecture, the RBSP fault 
management system allows for mission goals to be met.

1 INTRODUCTION 
1.1 Mission Summary 
NASA’s RBSP mission is a dual observatory mission that 
studies variations in solar activity and how this affects the 
earth’s environment as well as human activities in space and 
on the ground.[1]  This will improve our overall knowledge 
of the radiation belts and how they respond to solar storms 
and events. Particles accelerate through the radiation belts in 
unpredictable ways and scientists need more data to develop 
and improve current models of this important area 
surrounding the Earth. The on-board instruments measure 
high and low energy electrons and protons, ion composition, 
and electric and magnetic fields using the Energetic Particle 
Composition and Thermal Plasma Suite, the Electric and 
Magnetic Field Instrument Suite, Proton Spectrometer, 
Electric Field and Waves Instrument, and the Ion 
Composition Experiment.  
1.2 Mission and Spacecraft Overview 
The RBSP mission is comprised of twin observatories that 
are identically instrumented. They launched stacked 
together on a single launch vehicle. The mission design 
provides orbits for each observatory that maximize 
observation time in the Van Allen radiation belts to collect 
science data and space weather data. 
 
The observatories are designed to operate and survive in the 
harsh radiation belt environment using shielding for 
electronics as well as radiation hardened parts and circuitry. 
[2]  The observatories spin at a nominal spin rate of 5.5 rpm 
to provide the fields-of-view (FOV) required for the 
instruments to make their respective measurements.  The 
observatories downlink an average daily data volume of 6.4 
Gbits of recorded data, plus real time data, throughout the 
operational phase of the mission.  This data is received by 
the 60 foot dish at the APL ground station each day as the 
observatories pass overhead.  
 
The spacecraft launched on a single EELV Atlas V-401 
launch vehicle from Kennedy Space Center on August 30, 
2012. The launch vehicle spun up, released each 
observatory separately, and oriented each observatory with 
solar arrays pointed to the sun. Both observatories operate in 
   
 
 2
 highly elliptical orbits in order to spend a substantial part of 
the mission life in the Van Allen radiation belts. The two 
orbits have apogee altitudes between 30,050 and 31,250 km, 
perigee altitudes between 500 and 675 km, and inclination 
of 10 degrees. The observatories are phased such that one 
laps the other approximately four times per year. Each 
observatory, as depicted in Figure 1, is designed for an on-
 orbit life of 2 years and 74 days. This encompasses a 60-day 
commissioning period post launch, a 2-year science 
mission, and a 14-day decommissioning period at end of 
life. Spacecraft decommissioning includes a delta-V 
maneuver to lower the perigee and a precession maneuver to 
orient the solar arrays away from the sun; each spacecraft 
will be disposed of via uncontrolled atmospheric re-entry 
within 5 months. The 2-year science mission provides 
sufficient local time, altitude, and event coverage to 
improve the understanding of, and determine the relative 
significance of the various mechanisms that operate within 
the radiation belts and their individual and collective effects.  
 
 
Figure 1:  RBSP observatory 
 
The observatories operate independently in a spin stabilized 
mode with a 5.5 RPM nominal spin rate; the spin axis is 
maintained between 15 and 27 degree off pointing from the 
sun. Each observatory has four deployed solar array panels 
and eight deployed instrument booms. Two 40 m and two 
50 m spin plane booms provide AC and DC electric field 
measurements, two 6 m axial booms (12 m tip-to-tip) 
provide 3D electric field measurements, and two 
magnetometer booms extend an additional 2 m beyond the 
solar array panels. Figure 2 shows the observatory in a fully 
deployed configuration and Figure 3 shows the spacecraft 
bus with accommodation of the instruments and their FOVs. 
 
The observatories are nearly identical and comprised of 
mechanical/structural components, avionics, RF 
telecommunications, power generation and storage, power 
distribution, propulsion, guidance and control, thermal, 
flight software, and harness subsystems. Figure 4 shows the 
observatory block diagram, with the functional elements of 
the observatory and the interfaces and connectivity between 
the spacecraft and instrument components.

Figure 3:  RBSP spacecraft bus with instrument FOVs 
 
The mechanical subsystem includes primary and secondary 
structure (central cylinder and structural panels), 
mechanisms, deployables, and a separation system. The 
primary structure is a forged aluminum cylinder; the panels 
and decks are honeycomb with aluminum facesheet with 
cutouts for booms, instrument apertures, power shunts, 
thrusters, and Sun sensors. The octagonal cylinder is 1.3 m 
high and 1.8 m in diameter.  
 
The guidance and control (G&C) subsystem consists of a 
Sun sensor, the science magnetometer for attitude 
reconstruction on the ground, and blow down 
monopropellant hydrazine propulsion system for attitude 
control, spin rate change, Delta-V, and de-orbit maneuvers. 
The observatories are spin-stabilized, with a spin rate of 
approximately 5.5 RPM and a spin axis pointing towards the 
Sun. The observatories have no on-board software to 
estimate or control attitude or orbits, therefore all attitude 
maintenance maneuvers are performed open loop. Attitude 
sensor information from the Sun sensors is stored on-board 
the satellite and downlinked during the ground contact 
periods. Control maneuvers are planned on the ground, 
designed into canned executable sequences, uploaded to the 
satellite, and executed based on the planned timeline.

The avionics subsystem comprises the hardware command 
and data handling functions in a single spacecraft bus 
component, the Integrated Electronics Model (IEM). The 
IEM is a card cage design based upon the 6U Compact PCI 
(cPCI) form factor. The IEM consists of five cards 
connected across a common backplane. A 32-bit PCI bus, 
clocked at 16.5 MHz, connects the Single Board Computer 
(SBC), Solid-State Recorder (SSR) and Spacecraft Interface 
Card (SCIF) for flow of commands and telemetry. The SBC 
is a BAE RAD750 based design, clocked at 33 MHz for 50 
MIPS (nominal) with 16 MB of Synchronous Random 
Access Memory (SRAM), 4 MB of Electrically Erasable 
Programmable Read Only Memory (EEPROM) and 64 kB 
of Programmable Read Only Memory (PROM). The SSR 
contains 16 Gb of Synchronous Dynamic Random-Access 
Memory (SDRAM) memory with Error Detection and 
Correction (EDAC) and hardware scrubbing. The selected 
SDRAM has a low upset rate (even in the RBSP 
environment); the few SDRAM errors that are expected will 
be corrected by SSR EDAC.  
 
The onboard flight software provides the following 
functionality: command uplink, spacecraft command 
management, autonomy rule processing, command macro 
management, spacecraft time-tag command management, 
SSR management, telemetry management, downlink 
management, and spacecraft-to-instrument hardware 
interface management.  The remaining two IEM cards 
include a telemetry card which gathers temperature, analog 
and discrete data and a DC-DC converter card which 
provides regulated secondary voltages derived from the 
spacecraft primary power bus and implements the box off-
 pulse capability. 
 
The observatories utilize a Direct Energy Transfer (DET) 
power system. The power bus voltage varies with the eight-
 cell Lithium Ion (Li-Ion) battery voltage. The power system 
consists of the Power System Electronics (PSE), Battery 
Management Electronics (BME), Solar Array Junction Box 
(SAJB), 50AH Li-Ion battery, and four deployed solar array 
panels. The Power Distribution Unit (PDU) provides the 
switched, unswitched, and pulsed power to the observatory 
components. The PDU receives primary power from the 
PSE and has a serial Universal Asynchronous Receiver-
 Transmitter (UART) command/telemetry interface with the 
IEM. The PDU is a modular slice design, with each slice 
consisting of a printed circuit board housed in a mechanical 
frame, stacked and bolted together. The slices electrically 
connect using internal rigid-flex connectors for signals. A 
wiring harness external to the box is used for power 
connections.

 The Radio Frequency (RF) system operates at S-band, with 
unique uplink and downlink frequencies for each 
observatory. The RF system is sized to enable downlink of 
at least 6.7 Gb of data per day per spacecraft, including real-
 time housekeeping telemetry, during the operational phase 
of the mission. To meet data return requirements, the RF 
system provides data rates up to 2 Mbps. The data rate can 
change during a ground contact in order to accommodate 
different link parameters due to the changing spacecraft 
range to the ground station. 
 
The observatories utilize a cold-biased passive thermal 
control design system to maintain the on-board electronics 
and instruments on-board within their required temperature 
limits. The majority of the electronics boxes are hard 
mounted to the inside of the spacecraft panels and decks 
with their internal heat going into the spacecraft structure. 
Local radiators on the side panels and bottom deck control 
the amount of heat lost to the space. Multi-Layer Insulation 
(MLI) blankets cover the majority of the outside of the 
spacecraft, especially on the top deck to insulate the 
observatory from the Sun. Heater circuits on all the panels 
and decks are installed to protect the observatories from 
getting too cold. Very little heater power is required on-
 orbit, and the heater circuits are provided as a fail-safe 
device. A few observatory components, such as the Li-Ion 
battery and several instruments, are thermally isolated from 
the spacecraft and have individual radiators, blankets and 
heaters. 
2 Fault Management Design 
2.1 FM Definition /Objectives 
Fault Management (FM) is defined as the functional 
requirements distributed throughout the observatory and 
ground that enable detection, isolation, and recovery from 
events that upset nominal operations. The goal of the FM 
system is to achieve mission reliability objectives without 
violating program resources. FM must achieve this goal by 
balancing project risk and the cost of developing, testing, 
and operating the Fault Management System (FMS).   
 
The RBSP FMS is a distributed system with allocations to 
hardware, flight software, rule-based autonomy, and 
ground/mission operations. The RBSP FM design uses both 
“active” and “passive” features to deal with potential faults. 
Active features include actions taken on-board the 
observatory that are implemented with hardware, software, 
or a combination of the two, whereas passive features 
include design decisions and development practices to 
minimize the probability that a fault occurs. The overall 
goal for the on-board FMS is to be as simple as possible 
while ensuring that 1) the observatory is capable of 
detecting, correcting, and recovering from any single, 
recoverable anomaly that affects health and safety and 2) the 
observatory meets the overall mission concept and mission 
goals. 
2.2 Process for FM Development 
RBSP follows the Fault Management Engineering Process, 
which is documented within JHU/APL’s Quality 
Management System (QMS). The FM engineering Process 
prescribes a systematic approach to FM with collaboration 
among all members of the systems engineering team, 
subsystem leads, and mission operations, from Phase A 
through Phase E.  
Figure 5 depicts the high-level engineering process used in 
the development of the FM system for RBSP. Capturing 
distinctive mission design elements is critical to 
successfully developing the FMS, since it focuses the 
engineering team on what needs to be done differently in 
comparison with past missions. A significant portion of the 
early FM design approach focuses on describing the key 
mission design characteristics and possible advantages the 
mission design may offer in the design of the FMS. The 
RBSP top-level FM architecture also includes the 
redundancy concept, modes and safing concept, ground 
intervention concept, and critical sequences, as guided by 
the FM engineering process.  Reliability analyses play an 
important role in the development of the FMS by 
identifying potential faults and failures and analyzing the 
impact of cross-cutting faults and failures on the planned 
protection schemes in a comprehensive framework. The 
reliability analyses are used in an iterative manner, to ensure 
the quantity and impact of potential faults are minimized, 
completeness of the FM design, as well as to enable system 
efficiency in design and fault response.   
2.3 FM Design Drivers 
The RBSP FM design takes advantage of inherent mission 
design characteristics to reduce complexity, but a number of 
design drivers also influence the design. The near-Sun 
pointed, spin-stabilized design offers a number of 
advantages, while the extreme radiation environment, 
project cost constraints, and the NASA risk classification 
drive several unique features within the FMS. These design 
characteristics and drivers result in five high-level 
requirements that govern the overall RBSP FM design and 
from which lower-level FM concepts and requirements are 
derived. These high-level requirements include selective 
fault tolerance, minimized on-board fault management, 
layered fault management for maximum science, limited 
instrument fault management, and off-pulse capability for 
unswitched electronics and map into the fault management 
concepts for redundancy, modes and safing, and ground 
intervention.

2.3.1 Orbit/Spacecraft Design 
The nominal orientation of the observatory maintains the 
spin axis within a specified range of angles from the Sun 
line (15 – 27 deg). The allowable range of Sun offset angles 
is determined by minimum and maximum offsets from the 
ecliptic plane (N-S) and in the ecliptic plane (E-W). 
Propulsive maneuvers are performed periodically to 
maintain this near Sun-pointing attitude as the Earth (and 
observatories) move around the Sun. The spin axis drifts 
from a maximum total offset, through a minimum offset 
(equal to the N-S offset), back to the maximum between 
precession maneuvers as shown in  
Figure 6. The sizes of the offset angles determine how often 
precession maneuvers are performed (approximately every 
21 days).  
 
Figure 6:  Sun Offset Angles
 The G&C subsystem design takes advantage of the near-Sun 
pointed, spin-stabilized design by utilizing an open-loop 
architecture for the guidance and control functions. The 
observatories have no on-board software to estimate or 
control attitude or orbit, and attitude changes are performed 
by the ground with open-loop commanding of the on-board 
thrusters, thus greatly simplifying on-board FM.    
2.3.2 Environment 
The severe environment in which the observatories spend 
the majority of their time is a significant design driver: each 
observatory is designed for the challenging environmental 
requirements imposed by its orbit in the Van Allen 
Radiation Belts. The risk to electronic hardware is high 
since both observatories spend most of the mission life at 
high-risk altitudes to perform the science measurements. 
The environment causes high total ionizing dose and single 
event effects due to radiation as well as surface charging 
and deep dielectric charging/discharging on electrical 
hardware. The spacecraft and instrument subsystems and 
components operate continuously while the observatories 
transit through the heart of the inner-trapped proton Van 
Allen belt twice every ~9 hour orbit for the nominal 2 year 
+74 day mission. These energetic (up to hundreds of MeV) 
protons provide the majority of the penetrating dose and all 
of the displacement damage. The second major contribution 
to the total radiation dose is the outer belt trapped electrons 
that bombard the observatories during the long exposures 
near apogee.  
   
 
 6
 Since RBSP is a mostly single-string mission, several 
passive FM features are designed into the system to deal 
with these environmental effects. First, electronics boxes 
have additional shielding. Second, the radiation-hard parts 
program required devices to be tested to at least 50 krads 
(Si), with the required hardness based on chassis wall 
thickness and use of spot shielding. All integrated circuits 
are designed to be latch-up immune. Third, first circuit 
interfaces are hardened to survive deep dielectric discharge 
pulses in the spacecraft harness. Fourth, in order to enable 
sensitive science measurements, the spacecraft are designed 
with features to reduce spacecraft internal and surface 
charging, so that the spacecraft-generated fields will not 
contaminate the electric and magnetic fields being 
measured. In addition to these passive features, the FMS 
also employs an off-pulsing scheme to mitigate against the 
effects of discharges inside spacecraft components, 
discussed in detail later in this paper. 
2.4 Overview of FM Architecture 
In addition to the design characteristics and drivers that 
influence the FM architecture, the RBSP FMS includes a 
redundancy concept, modes and safing concept, and ground 
intervention concept. Each of these concepts are explained 
in detail in the following sections. 
2.4.1 Redundancy Concept 
All NASA-sponsored missions are required to adhere to the 
NASA procedural document 8705.4, Risk Classification for 
NASA Payloads, which provides general redundancy 
requirements based on the mission risk classification. 
However, the document leaves it to the engineering team to 
decide how best to implement redundancy requirements. 
The RBSP mission is classified as risk category C. As such, 
critical single-point failures (SPFs) for Level 1 requirements 
may be permitted, but are mitigated by use of high 
reliability parts, additional testing, or by other means; in 
addition, single string and selectively redundant design 
approaches may be used. The RBSP program abided by a 
selective fault tolerance posture to maximize reliability 
while minimizing cost and complexity. Fault tolerance for 
RBSP was directed at increasing the reliability of critical 
sequences, high-risk parts prone to failure, parts with failure 
modes due to the environment, or parts with movable 
components; redundancy was not used to increase the 
lifetime of limited-life items. The end result was a single-
 string architecture for RBSP with fault tolerance, as 
identified in Table 1 (note: degraded performance is 
highlighted in yellow). Fault tolerance options were 
identified through engineering rigor and the use of the fault 
analysis techniques such as probabilistic risk assessment 
(PRA) and failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA). 
These fault analysis techniques are used to systematically 
evaluate the benefit of redundancy, fault tolerance, and 
mitigation strategies. The decision to use fault tolerance was 
made by examining the reliability improvement, cost, 
complexity, and mission criticality.

2.4.2 Modes and Safing Concept 
Another component of the FM architecture is the 
development of the modes of operation and  the safing 
strategy in the event of critical faults. The term safing refers 
to an onboard autonomous activity that occurs after a major 
fault is detected; it demotes the observatory to its most basic 
functionality to maximize the potential for survival until the 
next ground contact. The observatory safing strategy is 
important to reducing mission risk. Due to its importance, 
the RBSP modes and safing strategy clearly presents two 
pieces of information to properly guide the FMS 
development process. First, the modes and safing strategy 
presents the objectives of each mode. Second, the modes 
and safing strategy clearly states the mode transitions and 
the types of faults that cause entry into safe mode. It should 
also be noted that the modes and safing strategy decision 
process flows from a strong understanding of the mission 
design and the critical sequences. 
 
In the end, the decision of how and when to safe a 
spacecraft affects the requirements for the spacecraft 
hardware, software, autonomy, and ground operations and 
helps to determine the FM modes. Another consideration 
the FM lead engineer should make in designing the safing 
strategy is including a “safety net” to capture unknown fault 
conditions. Despite the robust fault analysis tools, the FM 
lead engineer and larger engineering team must 
acknowledge a “lack of imagination” in identifying every 
fault (single fault, common cause failures, unintended 
subsystem interactions, multiple synchronous failures) and 
every necessary response for all phases of the mission. A 
robust safety net that can reset the entire system and/or 
cycle through all redundant components in a last-ditch effort 
to recover the spacecraft to a safe state should be included in 
the FM safing strategy. Nonetheless, the FM lead engineer 
should not make the safety net overly complex, as it can 
unnecessarily tax the design, implementation, and test 
resources allocated to the FMS development without 
providing a clear benefit. 
 
To reduce the complexity of the RBSP FMS, the goal was to 
have the least number of modes possible to safely perform 
the mission. By design, the RBSP observatories are in a safe 
state. The observatories are inherently stable, near-Sun 
pointing spinners, which require only periodic attitude 
precession maneuvers performed via an open-loop attitude 
control system. These inherent mission design 
characteristics and observatory design decisions result in a 
simplified safing concept for the mission, as compared to 
more complicated missions with 3-axis stabilized attitude 
control. Two modes have been identified for RBSP: 
Operational and Safe.  Operational Mode is the primary 
mode for the observatory and is used from launch through 
the end of the mission, unless the observatory encounters a 
life-threatening fault condition. When possible, the 
observatory “flies through” faults or “fails operational,” 
meaning that non-critical faults leave the observatory in 
Operational Mode. These faults are handled by the on-board 
FMS or by the ground during subsequent ground passes. 
The occurrence of a critical fault (e.g., low voltage sense, 
low battery state of charge, expiration of hardware 
command loss timer, or violation of maximum Sun-line 
angle) causes a transition to Safe Mode. The goal of Safe 
Mode is to autonomously place the spacecraft into a known 
communication-safe, power-preserving configuration so that 
ground operations has time to identify and recover from the 
fault. The transition from Safe Mode back to Operational 
Mode is performed by ground command only.  The RBSP 
FM modes diagram is shown in Figure 7.

2.4.2.1 Layered Fault Management for Maximum 
Science Data Collection 
Three of the high-level requirements that drive the RBSP 
FM design flow into the modes and safing concept. The first 
of these high-level requirements is layered FM to maximize 
science data collection. The mission is designed for 
concurrent particle and magnetic field, electric field, plasma 
density, and interferometric timing measurements. In order 
to meet these science measurement goals, the FMS utilizes a 
layered approach in order to maximize science data 
collection in the event of a fault. Faults are categorized by 
severity, with the goal of quickly detecting and responding 
to less severe, isolated faults with minimum interruption to 
science data collection, and ensuring a power-safe and 
communication-safe observatory for more severe, time-
 critical faults through a system-wide response. Various fault 
analysis tools such as FMEA and PRA are used to identify 
and categorize faults.  
 
Less severe faults are categorized as faults where the cause 
is more easily identified and isolated to a particular 
subsystem. These faults are treated locally at the subsystem 
level either by on-board FM (i.e., hardware, flight software, 
or rule-based autonomy) or by the ground during the 
subsequent ground passes. For faults that are handled on-
 board, the FMS detects the fault and the action taken allows 
the system to have limited or no interruption to Operational 
Mode in which science data is collected; the ground is 
responsible for identifying and correcting the problem 
during subsequent ground passes. For faults that are handled 
by the ground, provisions have been made that allow the 
ground to reset or off-pulse specific components through 
critical command decoder (CCD) and/or flight software 
commands.  
 
More severe faults are categorized as faults where the cause 
is less easily identified and could be attributed to one or 
more subsystems; in addition, these faults are more time-
 critical in that lack of immediate action could cause a 
mission-ending failure. For faults identified as severe, the 
on-board FMS detects the fault and the observatory is 
demoted to Safe Mode. Safe Mode is a more global 
response that is reserved for faults that require a system-
 level response with the goal of preserving observatory 
power and ensuring communication. 
2.4.2.2 Off-Pulsing Architecture 
The next high-level requirement that drives the modes and 
safing approach is off-pulsing for unswitched electronics. 
Since RBSP is a mostly single-string mission, critical 
components (i.e., IEM, PDU, and transceiver) are powered 
using unswitched power services so that they cannot be 
turned off once the spacecraft is powered up. However, the 
   
 
 9
 extreme radiation environment could induce faults in these 
components that can only be cleared by the removal and re-
 application of power (termed “off-pulsing”). The FMS 
implements an off-pulsing architecture that provides off-
 pulsing capabilities to clear faults in the transceiver, IEM, 
and PDU. Mechanisms are provided to allow individual off-
 pulsing of any of these components in Operational Mode. In 
addition, to address a safety net for unknown faults, the 
FMS can reset the entire system by off-pulsing all three of 
these critical components simultaneously in Safe Mode. In 
general, the off-pulsing of any single component is handled 
in Operational Mode as a response to a less severe fault, 
while the off-pulsing of all three components is handled in 
Safe Mode as a response to the expiration of the hardware 
command loss timer (i.e., the spacecraft has not received a 
specific command from the ground in 3.6 days).   
 
All off-pulse requests are routed through the PDU, with the 
PDU implementing a specific hardware command sequence 
for each off-pulse type. The off-pulse mechanism is 
designed to be fault-tolerant with a single fault resulting in, 
at most, a single off-pulse cycle.  The FM architecture 
utilizes the following off-pulse requests: IEM request to off-
 pulse transceiver (via software command loss timer 
[SWCLT]), transceiver request to off-pulse IEM (via RF 
CCD command), transceiver request of off-pulse PDU (via 
RF CCD command), and hardware command loss timer 
(HWCLT) request to off-pulse PDU, IEM, and transceiver 
as shown in Figure 8. 
 
Figure 8:  Top Level Off-Pulsing Architecture 
2.4.2.3 Limited Instrument Fault Management 
The final high-level requirement that drives the modes and 
safing approach is limited instrument FM.  The FMS is de-
 coupled from the science instruments. Instrument FM is 
limited to the monitoring of instrument power draw, power 
down request, and heartbeat. The instrument generates and 
provides the spacecraft with status information in the 
Interface Transfer Format (ITF). Instrument status includes 
power-down requests and an instrument aliveness counter. 
An instrument power-down request or frozen aliveness 
indicator results in the removal of operational power from 
the instrument within a pre-defined number of seconds. In 
the event of an instrument over-current/over-power 
condition, the instrument is immediately powered off with 
no advanced warning. Over-current/over-power protection 
is handled with a combination of autonomy rules and 
resettable circuit breakers located in the PDU. To protect 
against hard shorts, the PDU monitors current and if the 
load current exceeds a threshold for 4 ms, the circuit breaker 
opens the switch and power is immediately removed from 
the instrument. Autonomy rules protect against soft shorts 
by monitoring a lower power threshold for a longer 
duration.  
 
In addition, spacecraft anomalous conditions such as low 
battery state of charge, low voltage sense, or extended loss 
of communication result in all instruments being 
immediately powered off with no advanced shutdown 
warning. Therefore, instruments must be designed to be 
immediately powered-off from any internal mode in the 
event of an instrument over-current or spacecraft anomalous 
condition. For a violation of the spin-axis Sun-line angle, 
the instruments receive a 15 second shutdown warning 
before being powered off. Any additional FM measures that 
are specific to the instruments are the responsibility of the 
instruments themselves. 
2.4.3 Ground Intervention Concept 
The high-level requirement for limited on-board FM drives 
the ground intervention concept. In an effort to keep the 
FMS as simple as possible, on-board FM is minimized by 
taking advantage of inherent mission design characteristics 
and spacecraft design decisions. The spacecraft are spin 
stabilized with spin-axis 15-27 deg off the Sun. The near-
 Sun pointed attitude is the only attitude required to collect 
the prime science measurements and requires only periodic 
precession maneuvers every ~21days for the duration of the 
mission in order to be maintained. The periodic precession 
maneuvers are dictated by the Earth’s orbital motion around 
the Sun, with maneuvers performed when the total Sun 
offset angle reaches maximum value. This orbit offers a 
number of design advantages: 1) when combined with 
antenna coverage out to 70 deg from both sides of spin-axis, 
frequent ground contacts (more than 1/day) with negligible 
communication delays are possible, 2) the near-Sun pointed 
attitude ensures adequate power generation when attitude is 
maintained within the maximum offset angle, and 3) the 
inherently stable spin state requires infrequent adjustments 
to maintain the spacecraft’s orientation, allowing for open-
 loop attitude control. 
 
Since the RBSP spacecraft are near-Sun pointing spinners 
(inherently stable) with open-loop attitude control, there is 
no on-board capability for the G&C subsystem to 
autonomously point the spacecraft, which significantly 
reduces the amount of on-board autonomy required. In 
general, on-board autonomy is comprised of dedicated rules 
that take simple actions such as powering off a component 
or resetting a component. When possible, the FMS measures 
are allocated to hardware to reduce the size of the on-board 
autonomy rule set. Finally, the frequent ground contacts 
with negligible communication delays allow the burden for 
fault correction and recovery to be placed on the ground.

 3 Verification 
 
As a distributed system, the verification of the RBSP FM 
requirements was also distributed. Verification of 
subsystem-level FM requirements were captured in the 
various subsystem verification plans, with buy-in from the 
RBSP FM lead engineer. Verification of system-level FM 
requirements were performed on the spacecraft and led by 
the FM lead engineer. 
 
Requirements for the RBSP mission are organized 
hierarchically, based upon the mission’s product breakdown 
structure, as shown in Figure 9. Requirements are defined 
from the mission-level directly to the element-level in order 
to avoid the creation of too many documentation layers. In 
addition to the requirement level, the requirements tree is 
also organized according to requirement type (i.e., 
performance/measurement, mission assurance, 
environmental, and interface requirements). 
 
Figure 9: RBSP Mission Product Breakdown Structure 
 
The FM requirements are distributed and flow down from 
the Mission Requirements Document (MRD) to the 
element-level and then to the subsystem-level. The FM 
requirements are categorized as performance/measurement 
requirements which are captured in various requirements 
documents or as interface requirements which are captured 
in interface control documents (ICD). Figure 10 shows the 
hierarchy of FM requirements and the categorization of 
those requirements. 
 
 
Figure 10: Hierarchy of Fault Management 
Requirements 
 
Although FM requirements may be verified using test, 
analysis, demonstration, inspection, or some combination of 
these, the preferred verification method for FM 
requirements is test. The verification of FM requirements is 
accomplished through an integrated hierarchical approach 
comprised of a series of verification activities. During the 
Integration and Test (I&T) phase, verification progresses 
from individual components and subsystems to integrated 
segments and upward to the entire mission system. 
Individual components are verified by their providers 
against the corresponding component- and subsystem-level 
fault management requirements. The FM lead engineer has 
oversight authority over these lower-level FM verification 
activities and has access to all generated verification records 
and reports. In addition, the FM team performs system-level 
scenario testing and supports mission simulations and I&T 
special tests in order to verify the system-level (i.e., 
mission- and element-level) FM requirements. 
 
The FM team has oversight authority over lower-level FM 
verification activities and reviewed the verification plans for 
spacecraft subsystem and science instrument teams, which 
were allocated FM requirements to ensure that FM 
requirements are adequately verified. FM requirements 
allocated to hardware (i.e., spacecraft or ground) are verified 
during box-level and subsystem-level acceptance test. The 
individual subsystem teams are responsible for designing 
and running tests that verify these subsystem-level fault 
management requirements. FM requirements allocated to 
spacecraft flight software or ground software are verified by 
independent acceptance test at the flight software testbed 
level. The Independent Acceptance Test (IAT) team is 
responsible for designing and running the tests that verify 
these subsystem-level FM requirements. The tests used to 
perform the verification are typically black box, 
requirements-based tests. FM requirements allocated to 
spacecraft rule-based autonomy are verified by the 
autonomy team and autonomy developers on the flight 
software testbeds, high-fidelity hardware simulators, and the 
spacecraft. The autonomy test campaign is comprised of two 
phases: autonomy unit test phase and autonomy path 
verification phase. Autonomy unit testing is performed on 
the flight software testbeds early in the autonomy 
development and involves standalone testing of the 
individual autonomy objects (i.e., rule, macro, computed 
telemetry, and storage variable). The goal of the unit testing 
is to identify defects such as coding errors before the 
autonomy objects are assembled into a complete deliverable 
autonomy system.  At the conclusion of the unit test phase, 
the autonomy system is delivered to the spacecraft and the 
path verification phase begins (Note: the autonomy path 
verification testing is on the leading-edge of the FM 
scenario testing). The autonomy path verification testing 
takes place during spacecraft I&T with the purpose of 
exercising the autonomy system on flight hardware and 
verifying all of the sensor interfaces (i.e., sensor data used 
by autonomy rules and computed telemetry) and all 
   
 
 11
 commands emitted by the autonomy system to the flight 
hardware (from autonomy macros). The paths are 
independently verified on both spacecraft rather than 
endorsing a “verification by similarity” approach. FM 
requirements allocated to the ground system are verified by 
operational procedure, operational constraint, or by mission 
simulation. Verification of requirements using operational 
procedure are performed by inspection of the signed-off 
procedure document. Verification of requirements using 
operational constraint are performed by inspection of the 
RBSP Operations Constraint Document. Finally, 
verification of requirements using mission simulations are 
performed by test at the observatory level or the high 
fidelity hardware simulator.   
 
The FM team has overall responsibility for coordinating the 
mission- and element-level verification plans and activities.  
The resulting verification program ensures that the FMS 
satisfies the functional requirements and is in conformance 
with the mission and operational concepts defined for FM. 
The FM team is responsible for establishing, reviewing, and 
approving all FM verification activities and methods 
planned for requirements specified at the mission- and 
element-level. All mission- and element-level functional and 
performance requirements will be verified by one or more 
appropriate methods prior to launch, with closure status 
tracked in the DOORS requirements database system. 
Whenever possible, FM requirements at the mission- and 
element-level are verified by test. The FM team is 
responsible for designing and performing system-level 
scenario tests that verify the mission- and element-level FM 
requirements. In addition, some FM requirements are 
verified using mission simulations which are led by the 
Mission Operations Team (MOT) or I&T special tests 
which are led by the I&T Team. System-level scenario tests 
are developed, designed, and performed by the FM team to 
verify mission- and element-level FM requirements.  The 
system-level FM tests are scenario based tests that are 
similar to mission simulations except that one or more faults 
are injected during the simulation; the scenario tests are 
black-box, requirements-based tests. For each scenario, the 
test must (1) prove that the spacecraft can perform the 
scenario correctly (i.e., without fault injection) and (2) prove 
that the spacecraft can recover from the injected fault to a 
state in which the MOT can return the spacecraft to nominal 
operations.   
 
As a distributed system, the FM test campaign is divided 
into two distinct phases, as shown in Figure 11. The first 
phase is the subsystem-level test phase in which the 
individual subsystems design and run tests to verify and 
close their subsystem-level FM requirements (i.e., hardware, 
flight software, and autonomy). At the conclusion of the 
subsystem-level test phase, the subsystems are considered 
ready to be delivered to spacecraft I&T and are available for 
the second phase of the FM test campaign. The second 
phase is the system-level test phase that exercises the FMS 
as a whole on both spacecraft during I&T. The system-level 
tests serve two purposes: (1) verification of mission- and 
element-level FM requirements and (2) validation of 
subsystem-level FM requirements (Note:  subsystem-level 
FM requirements are verified and closed at the subsystem-
 level prior to I&T).   
Figure 11:  Fault Protection Test Campaign Overview 
 
System-level scenario testing is performed by the FM team 
and consists of a series of spacecraft scenarios. The 
objective of the system-level scenario tests is to verify 
mission- and element-level FM requirements; in addition, 
many of the subsystem-level requirements are also validated 
as a result of verifying the system-level requirements. The 
FM scenario testing consists of three tiers of testing. Tier 
one tests must be performed on both spacecraft two times 
(baseline and launch site), are included on the 
incompressible test list, and are regression tested on both 
spacecraft if a hardware configuration change or a 
significant FSW change affects the test. Tier two tests must 
be performed on both spacecraft at least once (baseline), are 
included on the incompressible test list, and are regression 
tested on the high-fidelity hardware simulator or the 
affected spacecraft if a hardware configuration change or a 
significant FSW change affects the test. Finally, tier three 
tests are performed on both spacecraft once (baseline).   
 
The baseline configuration for FM scenario testing is when 
the spacecraft bus is complete, with a goal of having 
instruments integrated. The test platform for the baseline 
FM testing is I&T; this allows the FMS (i.e., spacecraft bus 
hardware, C&DH flight software, autonomy, and 
ground/missions operations) to be exercised as a whole and 
permits the verification of all interfaces between 
components, all autonomy commands (via autonomy 
macros) to flight hardware and flight software, and all 
hardware (i.e., PDU) commands to flight hardware. The 
high fidelity hardware simulator (section 3.1) is used 
whenever possible to dry-run the scenario tests to identify 
and correct procedural errors and for regression testing of 
tier two tests.   
 
   
 
 12
 The scenario tests are designed through a process of 
grouping the FM requirements into sequences. The process 
is performed using a requirements-to-test allocation matrix 
in which each requirement is assigned to a test or group of 
tests. The selection of which tests form the incompressible 
test suite is performed through consultation and iteration of 
the core test list with the systems engineering team. 
Following the allocation of all requirements to the various 
tests, individual test plans are developed that include a set of 
starting conditions and high-level outline of test and 
verification activities. Each test plan includes the following 
information: test name, document number, tier designation, 
test objective, requirements fully or partially verified by the 
test, minimum spacecraft component set required to run the 
test, initial conditions for the test, required support, planning 
notes, and the high-level test outline.   
 
Figure 12 shows the activity flow for each scenario test 
during the system-level test phase.  Following the 
development of the system-level verification and test plan, 
individual test procedures are generated for each test. A test 
procedure is a configuration managed document that 
describes the detailed information necessary to run the test 
on the spacecraft and the list of steps taken to execute the 
test. The test procedure is also the as-run document used by 
the test conductor or FM lead engineer to document the 
major milestones of the test. When possible, the test 
procedure will be dry run on the high-fidelity simulators to 
identify and correct procedural errors. The test procedure is 
then executed on the observatory during I&T (eventually the 
procedure is run on both spacecraft). Any deviations from 
the test procedure are documented within the test procedure 
as red lines (i.e., permanent changes to the test procedure) or 
black lines (i.e., changes for the current procedure). If the 
test fails due to test procedure errors, the test procedure is 
corrected and the process is repeated. However, if the test 
fails due to an implementation error in flight hardware, 
flight software, or autonomy, a formal discrepancy is 
documented in the Anomaly/Problem Failure Reporting 
(APFR) system, any changes or corrections to autonomy, 
flight software, or hardware are implemented and the test is 
re-run until the anomaly is resolved and the test runs to 
successful completion. After the completion of each test, a 
review of the test procedure, as-run information, and 
spacecraft data is performed by a member of the FM team. 
Following the review of the test data, the FM lead engineer 
signs the test procedure confirming that the test was run and 
the review accurately described the success or failure of the 
test.

4 CONCLUSION 
The RBSP spacecraft are designed to operate for multiple 
years in the extreme environment of the Earth’s radiation 
belts.  To facilitate this mission, a robust fault management 
system is integrated into the system architecture from the 
earliest stages of the design.  This fault management system 
was rigorously tested during I&T, and the results of this 
testing show that the RBSP spacecraft are protected against 
on-orbit fault conditions, and therefore have a high 
probability of meeting the mission objectives.  The RBSP 
fault management design, implementation and test approach 
demonstrate that robust, fault-tolerant designs are 
achievable for complex systems operating in harsh 
environments, even for systems with only limited or 
selective redundancy.
