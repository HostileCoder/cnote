Abstract—A set of advanced analytics methods is 
investigated aiming at easier and higher quality e-/m- 
learning or blended tutoring. Security systems (SS) have 
been considered as an example of difficult-to-learn area. 
The topic of the presented investigation are contemporary 
education threats that will lead to big problems in the 
nearest future. It is shown that today the prevention of such 
threats is almost impossible without applications of 
intelligent technologies. Even more, the contemporary 
education system should possess some features of intelligent 
technologies or smart systems and advanced analytics 
elements. Original results are presented on how to build 
more effective classical applications by using novel puzzle 
methods. It is shown that all the demonstrated advantages 
may be successfully combined with other known methods 
from e-learning, m-learning or other education fields. Also it 
is shown how the considered applications enhance the 
quality of teaching, improve the emotional connection 
between the teacher and students and hence serve their 
sustainable learning and development. It has been discussed 
that qualitative forms of education may not require the 
usage of expensive hardware

 I. INTRODUCTION1
 Contemporary recession times turn govermnets pay 
more attention at the education problems accumilated 
since decades. It is easy to follow that the sustainable 
development of regions depends on sustainable careers of 
local people. Bulgarian goverment reports around 30% of 
young people with university diplomas and its goal is to 
make this number 40%. The tendency at the national level 
is using more and more sophisticated education tools and 
standards. However, the hardware and student 
accumulation isn‘t the right decision to the quoted 
problems. Advanced hardware (and standards) mean 
enlarged maintnance teams and help stuff. All professors 
or teachers also should improve their special software 
knowledge, etc. This is a long time- and money-

consuming process. Otherwise there is a risk of ineffective 
use of expensive resources. 
In this paper an advanced analytics method is 
considered aiming to improve the quality of the deep 
learning. Intelligent software: agents, etc. play more and 
more important role in contemporary (e-)learning systems  
and in blended education [1]–[8]. The quoted tools are 
especially effective in rapidly changing environments like 
SS. Suggested innovations serve the more effective 
application of advanced analytics, (deep) data/web mining 
and/or collective evolutionary components. Contemporary 
training of intelligent agents reaches such a high level that 
some elements of machine learning became practicable 
also in education. It is time to transfer the effective 
strategies from machine learning to school/university 
education. The research is based on a series of puzzle 
methods for intelligent knowledge/data processing 
elaborated within ULSIT-Sofia. The versatility of the 
proposed approaches is demonstrated also by their 
successful application for training soft agents or holons in 
the area of SS. The presented series of experimental 
results revealed accumulated problems that require the 
application of sophisticated modern intelligent methods 
for educational purposes: tendency to memorize rather 
than thinking, also named shallow learning, which starts 
from small classes of school education, the lack of 
attention due to the use of computer games and the too 
active use of Web forums and resources for 
communication, the desire to receive high marks without a 
deep understanding of the presented subject, etc. These 
accumulated problems can’t be solved using only 
traditional teaching methods. In the ongoing recession in 
the country we cannot allow the use of expensive 
technological solutions such as using smartphones to 
connect directly with the course data and video images of 
lecture material, G4 methods for m-learning, etc. [9]. 
Under these conditions we developed a relatively 
inexpensive technology for modern teaching based on a 
minimum of technological solutions that do not require 
high costs of purchasing and support [10]. 
II. PUZZLE METHODS
 The below considered methods had been designed for 
applications in different research systems. It is shown that 
198 
almost the same method applied in other way gives new 
results suitable for applications in SS and other 
sophisticated training. On the other hand, teaching SS 
stands out from other undergraduate and graduate 
programs that it operates in rapidly changing models, 
requirements, concepts, tools, instruments and policies 
where the problem for qualitative education is particularly 
difficult. Teaching highlights in the brightest way the 
advantages of the proposed new methods and applications 
in intelligent security systems (ISS). 
One of the most instructive facts about the audience 
for training is that current neural-based machines in the 
form of software agents or holons repeat the actions of the 
teacher on a much higher level, even related to an 
excellent student. Therefore, rote learning, simple 
memorization of lectures makes no sense: sooner or later 
machines will displace us from similar low-tech activities; 
instead creative learning should be deeply rationalized 
through comparisons with other research accessible 
through the Internet, by experimenting with numerous 
courses and with open source products which become 
more pervasive in our practice together with contemporary 
Web-applications. The above example illustrates how to 
achieve simultaneously two goals: explain essential 
principles of artificial neural networks functioning and
 modern principles of quality training through effective and 
deep understanding. Similarly, using the neural networks 
examples explains best practices for control of knowledge, 
for more tests for lagging students, etc. The application of 
the below described methods makes the lecture process 
more easy, understandable and transparent. Hence 
sustainable education results are obtained. Advanced data 
analytics methods are not easy to explain. However, their 
correct applications doesn‘t make the education 
complicated, because they are purposed to find more easy 
and effective ways of presentation. 
On the other hand, monitoring the quality of education 
processes most often uses different statistical methods. 
We used same methods in a general advanced analytics 
module together with logic applications described in this 
paper. The unification of logical and statistical parts come 
together using evolutionary ways. Those cardinally 
different results can‘t be used just in one simple bunch of 
data or knowledge. 
Diring the evolutionary process of joining statistical 
and logical data/knowledge, the accumulation of 
knowledge makes logical applications more and more 
effective and more universal than the probabilistic ones/ 
fuzzy estimates/similar applications. In the common case 
during data analytics processing, there is no convergence 
of the results but this does not hamper practical 
applications of these systems. In other words, bad and 
good designers will arrange the display window in quite 
different ways and there is no guarantee that every user 
understands the technology and that his access to the 
system will have positive results. In general, the use of 
synthetic methods is one of the most important and 
demanding elements of the efficiency of intelligent 
applications. But the winning combination of the proposed 
methods in the educational field depends on the lecturer's 
experience, which makes the performance much simpler 
than just in the automatic case. At this level, the operation 
of the advanced analytics module is limited to 
implementation-voluntary advices to the lecturer. 
Suggested innovations serve the more effective 
application of education practice altogether with data 
analytics applications, collective evolutionary 
components, etc. For more information sf. the book [10]. 
The research on traditional, syntactic puzzle methods 
reveals that their algorithmic complexity is rather high and 
this doesn‘t allow automatic processing of large enough 
sudokus, crosswords or puzzles. In the case  an accent 
should be made on the fact that the investigated machine-
 based procedure took the words from a predefined set 
using a random principle where only the lenght of the 
word is of importance. On the contrary to the quoted 
syntactical realizations, below a puzzle method is 
considered which is based on the logical analysis of the 
existing data or knowledge interconnections. Three types 
of relations have been used aiming at narrow the set of 
possible solutions of the problem. 
Briefly, every puzzle method aims to discover new or 
hidden knowledge by connecting the unknown, the sought 
solutions with previous experience accumulated in 
knowledge bases. Let the constraints of the considered 
problem form a curve in the space as depicted in Fig. 1. 
The main goal of the puzzle method is to reduce the 
multidimensional search space for the solution. For this 
purpose we used several limitations, in [10] the study is 
focused at the case of using ontologies instead of a set of 
nonlinear constraints, etc.  
Figure 1. Binding and other constraints 
Furthermore, the research of process dynamics aimed 
at reducing the field in certain cases allows us to derive 
new knowledge in the form of rules as discussed in the 
199 
next section. This inference process and the usage of 
different constraints gives way to significant 
simplification of formal and evidence material in lectures, 
attracts the attention to details and simultaneously 
increases the activity of learners. Showing the process of 
connecting known to unknown improves understanding 
and retention of the presented material. 
For example, if a bachelor who has graduated ULSIT 
lives in Sofia and he/she does not want to work anywhere 
else, then the line (curve) restricts the search space and in 
this way a lot of unnecessary [re]search is avoided. It is 
also possible to inspect a case when the constraint is 
defined in the form of surface but as a result a more 
general solution is obtained where a special interest is 
provoked by the boundary case of the crossing two or 
more surfaces. When the common case is inspected in 
details then in the majority of cases the problem is reduced 
to exploring the lines instead of curves with complicated 
forms obtained as a result of crossing surfaces. Therefore, 
below we investigate the usage in systems of constraints 
by lines of first or higher orders. 
The Vi constraints of linear/nonlinear form are the 
classic case borrowed from constraint satisfaction 
methods. The B-D binding constraints doesn‘t intersept 
the unknown goal but are located close to it, they reveal a 
‚neighboor‘ area around the target. The A-C-E constraints 
are named the crossword constraints because their 
interseption with G1 gives a part of the searched goal 
where Ci form larger interconnected areas in G1. The 
usage of the considered set of Ci-s is much more effective 
than of the classical set of  Vi-s.
 The following example shows how the search process 
can be reduced using ontologies. Let’s admit that the 
search space is presented on Fig. 2 where statistical data 
about SS are generalized about the regions depending on 
their price and quality. The goal: it is necessary to select 
an acceptable SS to our project. Let the right vertical, 
blue-coloured, subset of feasible solutions is chosen: 
‘excluding ISS designed outside Europe’. Then the space 
of feasible solutions is to the left of the separating surface 
which is depicted on the figure in the rightmost corner. 
In Fig. 2 another horisontal surface, depicted in the 
high corner in green, is shown delimiting the search space 
of the solutions. In our case it means ‘systems with 
unknown principles of operation’. It is accepted that in the 
data bases there is no clear distinction related to the 
presented criteria so the search of the feasible solutions is 
nonlinear, of high dimensionality, and practically it cannot 
be solved using traditional methods. Nevertheless, by 
applying ontologies the problem is solvable via the 
proposed puzzle method. There are two red dots depicted 
in the left corner on the same Fig. 2. Each of them also 
represents a kind of constraint but of another type which 
we name a binding constraint and it is introduced and 
researched by us. Its semantics is the following: it is not a 
solution but it resides close to the searched solution. 
Figure 2. SS application example 
By introducing new constraints or, sometimes, 
ontologies our goal is to show that it is possible to use 
causal links different from implications and that they help 
us search the goals in a more effective manner. 
In the tutoring case, using the crossword constraints 
from Fig. 1 also helps us reveal the dynamics of the 
problem solving process where the resolution process is 
sometimes more important than the proof itself. The usage 
of Vi constraints one by one doesn‘t always form the 
necessary closed area. Revealing Vi and other constraints 
one by one helps represent the resolution process in its 
dynamics and hence make deep inference to the problem. 
Even in the worst case, when the accumulated knowledge 
is incomplete for the problem resolution, the dynamics of 
what is represented analogicaly to Fig. 1 will show up 
what should be the resolution. The binding/crossword 
constraints are the form of non-implicative rule-based 
relations. Their application effects are discussed in the 
next section. 
III. VISUALIZATION ELEMENTS
 Essentially the puzzle methods  include a form of 
visualization, which leads to a creative work in various 
forms of training. We would like to remind that the high 
quality learning inevitably leads to independent research. 
In the present study it is shown that in some cases the 
graph itself from Fig. 1 may be sufficient for decision-
 making by the user or the expert. 
Different versions of the modeled knowledge 
contained in Fig. 2 provide a base to describe things that 
are difficult to express in words. Not surprisingly, a 
Chinese aphorism states ‘A picture replaces thousand 
words.’ It should be added: ‘... and is understood and 
memorized better.’ Below are given different linguistic 
equivalents of combinations of interpretations, similar to 
that of Fig. 1 and obtained by puzzle method: 
200 
Things are moving way that … 
... neither ... nor ... but it is too close to ...  
Looked at from another angle ... Other findings ... 
An object can be represented as intersection of two 
dynamic areas ...  
In the future, these two concepts should be used 
jointly ..., 
etc.
 These natural-language fragments can be presented in 
plain text for learners, but further it is shown that by the 
puzzle method this is executed much more naturally and 
better. For example, Fig. 3 show another example of 
puzzle method application revealing certain processes and 
relationships between objects. Concentrating the attention 
in the closed area of Fig. 3 and narrowing the set of 
analyzed elements supports the revealing of new 
implicative relation M-N referred to in Fig. 4. Informal 
causal relations are elaborated that are associated with the 
implication ‘from M it follows that N’. 
                                                                  
       V1                                    M             
      V2       
                             
       
                                                                     N
                           V3
 Figure 3. M, N are unrelated, belong to confined area 
In Fig. 4 the system of three different constraint sets 
helps detect a causal relationship between M and N, with 
no evident correlation between them in Fig. 3. The 
connection occurs in imposing additional constraints in 
Fig. 3. The process is dynamic in nature and it is almost 
impossible to be properly explained only with words. Here 
the set of the pictures has a role of the replacement of the 
intuition process. 
The process of finding new rules using puzzle methods 
gives the trained people necessary deep knowledge. This 
form of knowledge can be sometimes respresented in the 
form of ontologies. 
The image (or media) from Fig. 3-Fig. 4 is convenient 
and efficient to visualize, transform and use different 
dynamic processes through sense-based explanations. 
Examples and figures can lead to the conclusion that 
ontologies are introduced, used and dynamically changed 
applying the puzzle methods. Hence they can be improved 
using puzzle methods. 
                                       A                           
       V1                                    M             B
       V2       
                             
D      
                                                                     N
       C                    V3
 Figure 4. Detection of the rule connection M–N 
Unlike the traditional oral presentation, the material 
visualized by the puzzle method gives more directions for 
[future] own research and for detecting and correcting 
gaps in knowledge. For example, ‘it is neither ... nor ...’ 
and many other natural-language interpretations 
incorporate a lot of fuzziness that can sometimes be 
misunderstood. Careful study of graphs similar to Fig. 4 
excludes presentation incomleteness and furthermore – a 
misunderstanding of the material. On the other hand, the 
whole learning process is concentrated in one place, it is 
not necessary to look for other Web sources to clarify the 
question e.g. ‘why’, ‘what’, ‘how’ to get results, etc. The 
quoted relations also have been used for pointing the 
lecture main points. Intelligent training tools not only 
accelerate but also intensify the training. Hence its high 
quality. 
A wide range of tools for modeling and presentation of 
material is used in this section where the modeling must 
be used not for ISS software agents but for people. 
Respectively it is easier to introduce audio or multimedia 
presentations, for example, ontologies for transmitting the 
meaning of things. Sometimes to present the meaning of 
things it is enough to show one or several key points of 
the subject altogether with corresponding explanations in 
visual, graph or sound form. Sometimes one key picture 
with concize explanations is better than an entire movie. 
Of most importance are the descriptions to a picture that 
describe the essentials, important details, and the sense of 
the presentation. The picture explains many details clear 
to people, but intelligent agents will learn nothing from 
this picture, especially if the agents are designed only for 
SS purposes. Hence many agent-based methods are much 
more effective in people tutoring systems. 
Information presentation by meaning is a key element 
of modern higher and university education. The proposed 
puzzle methods altogether with the other tested methods 
greatly expand opportunities for qualitative teaching in the 
field of SS, one of dynamic interdisciplinary specialties 
201 
with increased complexity and also of various types of 
strict and high requirements for the learners. 
IV. EXPLORATION OF EMOTIONS CONTROL
 The control of student emotions is a perspective and 
rapidly growing field of contemporary learning and 
education. It can help us resolve many of the negative 
issues quoted in the introduction. Really, without the 
curiosity element all the high-level education strategies 
will be ruined. We are far from modeling the curiosity 
elements in software systems [11] or from automatic 
deciphering of different human emotions. Instead we 
concentrate attention on research of emotional elements in 
different puzzle method applications in blended learning 
which undoubtedly bring comfort learning conditions.  
It is revealed that puzzle methods lead to dynamic 
results obtained during the education process. Of course, 
these results bring much more positive emotional elements 
comparing to presentations of ready formulas, theoretic 
schemes, etc. Hence any results obtained via puzzles have 
a practical element well understandable by students.  
The considered practical application scheme consists 
of three elements accompanying every lecture material: 
game elements incorporated in the lecture itself,  curiosity 
reinforcement and self-learning (homework). Using Game 
Theory elements or, for example, ‘olympic’ competitions 
help us to reveal most active students, give them bonuses 
and other reinforcement awards. Actually the active study 
at the classroom activates not only the group of best 
learners but also many others who can compare their 
results to others. Puzzle methods attract attention to 
important elements of the considered process, they ease 
the natural process of ontology (sense) formation in 
student‘s heads. The system of class competitions and 
reinforcement of people studied additional material at 
home completes the quality, deep education process 
necessary in case of SS and other contemporary 
theoretic/technological fields. E-learning is very welcome 
at the homework stage. Years ago there was a field named 
‘cognitive graphics’  aiming at revealing hidden 
mathematical relations via color-based graphics ‘movies’. 
Its driving force was to wake the student’s curiosity to 
informal and beautiful things like repeating patterns, parts 
of the image leading to new formal proofs, etc. In the 
present research we use some analogical elements 
altogether with advanced analytics and brainstorming 
sessions with purpose to get rid of inactive rote learning 
and only repetitions of teacher’s words at the exams. The 
student group positive emotions are one of the important 
parts of this process and it was found out that deep 
knowledge brought by puzzles can help us in the case. The 
considered experiments and the perspective research can’t 
be completed soon. 
What is done till now for the sake of comfort learning 
conditions: 
The presentations are multicolored where different 
colors correspond to different meanings explained in 
advance. A strong system of meaning explanations makes 
learning simpler and easier, tow main parts of positive 
emotional contact. 
First of all, the accent is on essential, basic things and 
on mutual relations between them, even during most 
intensive courses. Difficult-to-understand technical details 
may be studied in addition, later, at home, for example via 
e-learning system, and then tested via competitions at 
class, and so on. 
Such a modular course structure leads to the formation 
in the minds of essential definitions/strategies/know-how 
base. It makes the links between universities and high 
schools/colleges stronger and more natural. It is obvious 
that the most introductory part of some university lectures 
can be presented at schools aiming at finding most 
interested and active pupils ready to develop some 
research at early stages of the education process. 
All of the considered tactics, principles and 
methodologies are purposed for structuration of 
knowledge what is important, what is perspective and 
what should be learned in a particular order because it is 
essential, etc. The intensive presentation should be 
emotional and may use different game styles to escape the 
boredom because of the lack of attention. Puzzle methods 
help us in case. 
Today the lack of attention, love to computer games 
and other shortcomings explored in the introduction may 
be compensated using game-based learning strategies and 
application of some emotional elements. Hence the 
affective learning should be strictly controlled by a system 
of education methods and good practice. Otherwise the 
speaker may lose the control over the intensive or deep 
and high quality learning. 
V. CONCLUSIONS
 The main conclusion is that to overcome the 
contemporary education shortcomings, methods and 
applications are considered concerning the logical parts of 
advanced analytics. The role of the above methods for 
different education purposes is discussed. 
Analysis is represented for technologies used for 
discovery of sense, sending information by sense, and for 
understanding the semantics of the presented material. 
Common advantages and disadvantages for different 
groups of contemporary applications have been revealed.  
Same methods in different combinations are 
effectively used to enhance security stuff possibilities or in 
contemporary e-learning systems in the field of 
Information/National Security [12]. Since a long time, 
applications in/outside the field of information security 
have been made in education and tutoring systems, 
concerning the most difficult education cases. 
It is shown how, by applying the principles of 
advanced analytics technology for lecturing pupils/ 
students, there is a substantial rise in the quality of 
lecturing even for the most difficult disciplines, and there 
is sustainability in the implementation of the studied 
202 
material, which obviously leads to sustainable 
development of the regions. Deep understanding of the 
presented material is necessary in case. It can be obtained 
only by a combination of applied blended education 
methods, like puzzle methods, with enough practical 
experience made by each of the trained people at home, 
office or other place outside the education hall. The deep 
understanding of the material is impossible without the 
self-training, and the above mentioned advanced analytics 
methods are purposed to attract the interest to the field by 
showing up hidden and deep interconnected relations.
