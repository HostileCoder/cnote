Abstract—Twitter is a well-known micro-blogging website which 
allows millions of users to interact over different types of 
communities, topics, and tweeting trends. The big data being 
generated on Twitter daily, and its significant impact on social 
networking, has motivated the application of data mining 
(analysis) to extract useful information from tweets. In this 
paper, we analyze the impact of tweets in predicting the winner 
of the recent 2013 election held in Pakistan. We identify relevant 
Twitter users, pre-process their tweets, and construct predictive 
models for three representative political parties which were 
significantly tweeted, i.e., Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI), 
Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PMLN), and Muttahida Qaumi 
Movement (MQM). The predictions for last four days before the 
elections showed that PTI will emerge as the election winner, 
which was actually won by PMLN. However, considering that 
PTI obtained landslide victory in one province and bagged 
several important seats across the country, we conclude that 
Twitter can have some type of a positive influence on the election 
result, although it cannot be considered representative of the 
overall voting population.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Twitter is a well-known micro-blogging website which 
currently allows millions of users to inter-connect through 
voiced opinions, in the form of fixed-length textual statements 
called tweets. Although not strictly defined, Twitter has the 
concept of user communities related to different types of 
discussion topics, e.g., politics, education, research, 
entertainment, humor, domestic issues etc. The field of Social 
Network Analysis has concentrated particularly on the 
detection of such communities and an analysis of their tweet 
flow, particularly regarding the opinions and sentiments of 
users. In fact, considering that around 540 million tweets are 
being generated daily [1], Twitter becomes a perfect 
application for big data analysis (data mining) regarding the 
extraction of the generic public opinion on the diverse 
discussion topics. These opinions can positively impact 
different types of crucial objectives related to strategic 
management, governmental policies and reforms, product 
brand and retail management, customer relationship 
management, operational optimization etc [2] [3] [4] [5] [6].  
    An interesting application of Twitter analysis is focused on 
politics, e.g., gauging the sentiments of users regarding the 
current government’s policies, or the most favorable candidate 
(or political party) to win an upcoming election. Usually near 
to or prior to the election date, the users tweet about their 
favorite candidate and their opponents. Some tweets highlight 
the events happening around the elections that could be useful 
in determining the public opinion of the users, the problems 
they face, the challenges they have, and the hopes that they 
attach to the future elected government.  
The days around May 11, 2013 were quite eventful for the 
Pakistani users on Twitter, as Pakistan’s General Elections 
were held on this date for the 2013-2018 tenure [9]. These 
elections represented the full-term completion of one 
democratically elected government and transfer of power to 
another one. We observed a significant tweeting rate on this 
topic starting from January 2013 uptil the election date.  
In this paper, we focus on Twitter to analyze the relevant 
Pakistani Election-based tweets, from January 2013 till 7th 
May, 2013. Our goal is to determine the election winner based 
on Predictive Analytics techniques and we selected Twitter 
because of its previous use in election opinion analysis and 
electoral prediction in different countries [7] [8] [12] [13] [16] 
[17] (see Section II). After monitoring of tweets it was 
revealed that three political parties were more significantly 
tweeted as compared to others, i.e., Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf 
(PTI), Pakistan Muslim League Nawaz (PMLN), and 
Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM). We categorized the 
tweets as either in favor of (Pro) or against (Anti) a given 
party. After carrying out the relevant tweet processing steps 
(removal of unnecessary information), we employed 
Predictive Analytics to learn decision trees [18] for each 
political party with the Rapid Miner data mining tool. We then 
employed these trees to accurately predict the election winner 
based on tweets of 8th May, 9th May, 10th May and 11th May. 
Although the results showed that PTI will emerge as the 
election winner, the actual overall winner was PML-N while 
PTI won comprehensively in the Khyber Pakhtunkhaa 
province and in several other constituencies. In other words, 
Twitter can have some type of a positive influence in the 
electoral results, but it cannot be considered completely 
representative of the voting population.

This paper is structured as follows. Section II explores 
work related to Twitter big data analysis for electoral 
prediction and other applications. Section III elaborates our 
tweet gathering and preprocessing stages that form a vital 
component before any analysis activity. Then, Section IV 
highlights our experimental methodology and Section V 
discusses the results including interpretation and accuracy of 
the learnt decision tree models, and the prediction of the 
winner. Finally, Section VI concludes with a mention of the 
limitations of our work and future work directions. 
II. RELATED WORK 
Twitter has been analyzed in the 2008 US presidential 
elections. Topsy, which a real time social network analytics 
provider, in a joint work with Twitter, built the “Twitter 
Political Index” which presented a daily analysis of user’s 
sentiments for various topics related to the elections. Topsy 
analyzed tweets about both the presidential candidates 
(Obama and Romney) and calculated their popularity score 
based on the sentiment present in the users’ tweets [10] [11].  
A big data analysis project for a Stanford course adopted a 
related approach for the 2012 US presidential elections [7]. 
They found that support vector machines are better predictive 
models than naïve Bayes, and used them to correctly predict 
Obama as the election winner. Notwithstanding the result, the 
authors also highlight that Twitter cannot be considered 
completely self-sufficient in predicting elections. Also, in 
[16], the authors employ sentiment analysis on tweets to 
predict the voting percentage, i.e., the percentage of votes, 
which each presidential candidate will receive in the 
Singapore Presidential Election 2011. They create sentiment 
divisions and employ re-weighting techniques on these 
divisions to predict voting percentage.  The results didn’t 
predict the correct winner, and the authors indicate a change in 
voting trend and fake Twitter sentiment for these 
discrepancies. 
In [12], the authors analyzed about 100,000 tweets 
containing the name or mention to a political party or 
politician. This study was done to understand if there was any 
linkage or similarity between the online political sentiment 
and offline sentiment about the German Federal Elections. 
They used Twitter messages to predict the popularity of 
political parties, candidates and coalitions in the real world. 
This work also uses sentiment analysis techniques to measure 
the popularity of the candidates in question. Twitter opinion 
mining has also been applied to the Belgian elections of 2010. 
The experiment was conducted on 7600 tweets about Belgian 
politicians, and positive and negative sentiments were 
calculated using sentiment analysis techniques. Different 
analytics were extracted from the study and are elaborated in 
[13]. Notwithstanding these applications, it has been 
significantly highlighted in [17] that the predictive accuracy of 
Twitter in predicting the election winner is quite exaggerated. 
The authors prove that Twitter analysis often provides a 
myopic view of the election results, but it definitely cannot 
replace the traditional voting method.  
In this paper, we are not aiming for this replacement – we 
are simply gauging the opinions of the users based on what 
data we have, although we already know that Twitter is not 
that commonly used across Pakistan as in USA, Germany etc. 
Our results are hence valid across the computer-savvy 
population which is mainly resident in important cities like 
Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad etc. Other than politics, 
Twitter data has also been used in domains such as healthcare 
and disease control. The study in [14], has conducted the 
surveillance of Twitter data for asthma related tweets using 
NLP and Machine learning techniques for this study. Their 
models are able to predict with good certainty whether the 
tweet was made for the symptom of the disease, its medication 
or its triggers. Also its sentiment could be determined as 
positive or negative. Statistical machine-learning classifiers 
including K-nearest neighbors, Naive Bayes and Support 
Vector Machines were trained on the unigram and bigram 
models of the data. 
III. DATA PRE-PROCESSING 
The first step in big data analysis is data pre-processing 
(data cleaning), which involves crucial steps for preparing the 
data for analysis, e.g., data extraction, selection, reduction, 
transformation etc. [18]. Our data pre-processing steps are 
described below. 
A. Data Gathering 
Data was gathered using a website called Twimemachine 
[15], which allows you to fetch the latest tweets of a user. 
However, it only fetches around 3200 latest tweets of a user. 
This cap was enough for us as we only needed data from 
January 2013 - May 2013 till the Election Day, that is, May 
11. For most users' timelines, this was enough.  As mentioned 
in Section I, we concentrated on tweets related to three 
political parties which were significantly tweeted, i.e., 
Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaaf (PTI), Pakistan Muslim League 
Nawaz (PMLN), and Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM).  
 
Visual Analysis: 
After observing, tweets of around 50 relevant users, for 
around two to three weeks, we decided to fetch tweets of 24 
users, 15 of which were political analysts and 9 were normal 
everyday users. We selected these users based on the content 
of their tweets, i.e., we deemed their tweets most relevant for 
electoral prediction. This activity got us approximately 55000 
tweets out of which only 9000 were relevant with respect to 
the attributes we considered important for a tweet to be 
political. Some of these attributes are highlighted in Figure 1. 
Many of them were popular hash tags that were trending on 
Twitter during the election period. Others were frequently 
used terms or names of political parties and politicians.

B. Data Cleaning 
 We downloaded the tweets as raw text files and 
cleaned them by performing the following steps: 
• Removed the word “RT” (denotes re-tweet) 
• Removed usernames, written as “@username”  
• Removed all URLs  
• Removed the following punctuation marks:, " ' ? ! ; : # 
$ % & ( ) * + - / < > = [ ] \ ^ _ { } | ~  
• Removed all dates and timestamps of tweets from the 
tweet content but stored it in a separate record against 
the tweet. 
• Replaced double and triple spaces between words 
with single space.  
• Removed stop words, but later when constructing the 
attribute matrix (detailed in next section), this effort 
seemed unnecessary. 
After executing the aforementioned steps, we got a normalized 
version of most tweets. For instance, the tweet “RT 
@NadeemfParacha: A defiant press conference in Karachi by 
ANP, MQM and PPP. Tue Apr 30 19:39:16 +0000 2013” was 
transformed to “A defiant press conference in Karachi by ANP 
MQM and PPP” after cleaning. 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL METHODOLOGY 
     As mentioned in Section I, our goal is to predict the 
winning political party of the Pakistan 2013 elections. For 
this, we train predictive models for each party and test them to 
predict the winning party. Our prediction (classification) 
labels are Pro and Anti; Pro represents a positive sentiment 
favoring the party and Anti represents a negative one. We 
constructed three separate attribute matrices for each political 
party, and use them to construct predictive models using 
tweets from 1st January, 2013 till 7th May, 2013.  Specifically, 
we manually visualized and extracted those tweets for each 
party which contained those attributes that represent either a 
Pro or Anti opinion. We rejected tweets with a neutral 
opinion. For example, the PTI matrix contains attributes like 
"IMRANKHAN" (sentiment for PTI candidate Imran Khan), 
"TEHREEKEINSAAF" (sentiment for PTI), 
"IK4NayaPakistan" (support Imran Khan for a New Pakistan), 
"StampOnBat" (vote for bat which is the electoral image for 
PTI) etc. Having identified the attributes, we then updated the 
respective column for an attribute with a ‘0’ if the attribute is 
not found in the tweet and ‘1’ if the attribute exists. Finally, 
we labeled each tweet with either Pro or Anti. Table I shows a 
snapshot of the PTI matrix with both attributes and labels, and 
Table II shows a snapshot from the MQM matrix with only 
the labels.

We identified 10 attributes for PTI and PMLN and 13 
attributes for MQM. Also, the PTI, PMLN and MQM training 
matrices contained 318, 362 and 858 tweets respectively.  
      For training, we used the Rapid Miner tool (http://rapid-
 i.com/) to experiment with three different standard predictive 
models, i.e., CHAID decision tree, Naïve Bayes and Support 
Vector Machine (SVM) [18]. CHAID (Chi-squared Automatic 
Interaction Detector) is well suited for the analysis of larger 
datasets. It builds non-binary trees where each non-terminal 
node identifies a split condition on attributes using the Chi-
 squared test, to yield optimum prediction of the label. 
The naive Bayes is a simple probabilistic classifier based on 
applying Bayes' theorem with strong 
(naive) independence assumptions, i.e., the presence or absence 
of an attribute is unrelated to the presence or absence of any 
other feature. Finally, SVM is a non-probabilistic, linear, and a 
binary predictor which maps a prediction problem into a high-
 dimensional space to determine the support vectors, i.e., the 
subset of training data which is most representative to 
distinguish between the two classes (Pro and Anti). Both naïve 
Bayes and SVM have shown high predictive performance on 
many datasets (for more details on these models, refer to [18]). 
We train our 3 models by using the standard 10-fold cross-
52 
 
validation [18] and compare their predictive accuracy, i.e., the 
percentage of correct predictions. 
     After training, we constructed test attribute matrices for 
each political party. The test matrix for a given party contained 
the same attributes as listed in its training matrix. The tweets 
from 8th May 2013 – 11th May 2013 were used in the test 
matrices. These tweets were pre-processed and the matrices 
populated with 1 and 0 as for training counterparts. The PTI, 
PMLN and MQM test matrices contained 121, 123 and 192 
tweets respectively. We left the “Label” column blank, as this 
is predicted by Rapid Miner by using the party-specific 
predictive model. The party which gives the largest percentage 
of correct predictions is the predicted winner. Finally, for the 
sake of increased validation, we manually inserted the labels in 
each test matrix to compare with the predictions of Rapid 
Miner.  
V. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this section, we discuss our results. Initially, we compare 
the predictive accuracies of CHAID, naïve Bayes and SVM, 
which are shown in Table III1.  
Table III     Accuracies for CHAID, Naïve Bayes, and SVM 
Algorithm Accuracy 
CHAID 
PTI 77% 
PMLN 66% 
MQM 60% 
 
Naïve

PMLN 64% 
MQM 59% 
 
Support 
Vector 
Machine 
PTI 78% 
PMLN 65% 
MQM 53% 
We can see that there is no significant difference in the 
accuracies of the algorithms, with respect to the political 
parties. Still, CHAID gives better accuracy for PMLN and 
MQM. We thus select CHAID because it also outputs 
prediction rules which help us to understand the positive (Pro) 
and negative (Anti) sentiments of Twitter users regarding 
political parties. We enlist them in the following sections. 
A. PTI Predictive Rules 
      The PTI classification rules which are more important for 
prediction are enlisted below: 
• Tweets containing only “IK” are 76% Pro-PTI 
• Tweets containing only “PTI” are 91% Pro-PTI 
• Tweets containing “PTI” and “Support” are 70% Pro-
 PTI 
• Tweets containing “PTI” and “NayaPakistan”, or 
“PTI” and “IMRANKHAN”  are 100% Pro-PTI 
•  Tweets containing “PTI” and “IK” are 75% Pro-PTI 
• Tweets containing “PTI”, “IK” and “Support” are 
72% Pro-PTI 
• Tweets containing “PTI”, “IK” and “NayaPakistan” 
are 100% Pro-PTI 
                                                           
1 All percentages in this paper are rounded to the nearest 
integer 
• Tweets containing “PTI”, “IK” and “IMRANKHAN” 
are 100% Pro-PTI 
• Tweets containing “PTI” and “Reject” are 100% 
Anti-PTI 
 
B.  PMLN Predictive Rules 
      The PMLN classification rules which are more important 
for prediction are enlisted below: 
• Tweets containing “Nawaz Sharif” and “vote” are 
75% Pro-PMLN 
• Tweets containing “pmln” and “vote” are 64% Pro-
 PMLN 
• Tweets containing “pmln” and “join” are 60% Pro-
 PMLN 
• Tweets containing only “Nawaz Sharif” are 
approximately 50% Pro-PMLN and 50% Anti-PMLN 
• Tweets containing “pmln” and “Nawaz Sharif” are 
63% Anti-PMLN, while Tweets containing “pmln”, 
“Nawaz Sharif” and “pti” are 63% Pro-PMLN 
• Tweets containing “pmln” and “shame” are 86% 
Anti-PMLN 
• Tweets containing “pmln” are 77% Anti-PMLN 
Tweets containing “pmln” and “pti” are 68% Anti-
 PMLN 
• Tweets containing “pmln”, “vote” and “pti” 
 are 70% Anti-PMLN 
• Tweets containing “pmln”, “support” and “shame” 
are 100% Anti-PMLN 
 
C. MQM Predictive Rules 
     The MQM classification rules which are more important 
for prediction are enlisted below: 
• Tweets containing “MQM” and “support” are 63% 
Pro-MQM 
• Tweets containing “MQM” and “Altaf” are 65% Pro-
 MQM 
• Tweets containing “MQM” and “WaadaByMQM” 
are 100% Pro-MQM 
• Tweets containing “MQM” and “TeamMQM” are 
97% Pro-MQM 
• Tweets containing “MQM” and “join” are 58% Pro-
 MQM  
• A tweet not containing “MQM” is 68% Anti-MQM, 
while tweets containing only “MQM” are 57% Anti-
 MQM 
• Tweets containing “MQM” and “vote” are 63% Anti-
 MQM 
 
D. A Comparison of Predictive Rules 
From the aforementioned rules, we extract the following 
important information: 
• A large majority of PTI and MQM tweets are in 
favor of the party, and the Pro percentages for 
these tweets are higher as compared to those for 
53 
 
PMLN. In other words, a high positive sentiment 
is associated with PTI and MQM, as compared to 
PMLN. 
• There is a higher positive sentiment for PTI as 
compared to MQM 
• PMLN has been primarily criticized by PTI 
supporters and vice versa (this fact is associated 
with the occasional vociferous speeches by each 
party’s candidates against the others) 
• The word “MQM” (by itself) has largely been 
used to express negative sentiments about MQM 
• The word “PTI” (by itself) has largely been used 
to express positive sentiments about PTI 
• The birth of a new Pakistan (“NayaPakistan”) 
was a prime motivation for Twitter users to 
express support for PTI  
• Users have used the name of the PTI prime 
minister candidate (ImranKhan) to largely 
express positive sentiment, and the name of 
PMLN prime minister candidate (Nawaz Sharif) 
to express positive and negative sentiment 
equally; MQM candidate Altaf Hussain was not 
that much significantly mentioned. 
• The promises made by MQM and its unifying 
spirit for the supporters were primary motivations 
to express support for MQM. 
E. Precision  for Pro and Anti Classes 
Using CHAID, we determine the precision for each of the 
two classes, i.e., Pro and Anti. The results are shown in 
Tables IV, V and VI. The highest precision for Pro is 
obtained for PTI (78%) followed by MQM (71%) and 
PMLN (69%). Anti precisions are lesser than their Pro 
counterparts, for each party, with the highest for MQM 
(59%), PMLN (53%) and then PTI (42%). Clearly, Pro is 
being predicted better than Anti for each party, although 
the difference is the least for MQM, followed by PMLN 
and then PTI (highest difference). This is probably due to 
the lesser frequency of Anti statements available for PTI 
and PMLN data. Note that the “recall” measure, i.e., the 
number of retrieved relevant instances, is not much useful 
in a cross-validation scenario of data training [18]. 
Table IV    Class Precision for PTI 
 True Pro True Anti Precision 
Predicted Pro 238 67 79% 
Predicted Anti 7 5 42% 
 
Table V    Class Precision for PMLN

Predicted Anti 30 33 53% 
 
Table VI    Class Precision for MQM 
 True Pro True Anti Precision 
Predicted Pro 120 51 71% 
Predicted Anti 286 400 59% 
F. Predicting the Winning Party 
      As outlined in Section IV, we constructed test matrices for 
PTI, PMLN and MQM and used them to make predictions for 
8th May – 11th May, by using the learnt decision trees for each 
party. The predictions for PTI, PMLN and MQM are shown in 
Tables VII, VIII and IX respectively. In each table, we first 
list the number of tweets for each day, followed by the number 
of Pro predictions (Pro Pred.) and Anti predictions (Anti 
Pred.) for that day. All predictions are expressed as 
percentages. 
 
Table VII  Electoral Prediction for PTI 
 Tweets Pro Pred. Anti Pred. 
8th May 16 100%  0% 
9th May 31 97%  3% 
10th May 32 97%  3% 
11th May 39 100%  0% 
 
Table VIII  Electoral Prediction for PMLN 
 Tweets Pro Pred. Anti Pred. 
8th May 19 26% 74%  
9th May 15 0% 100%  
10th May 16 6% 94%  
11th May 73 23% 77%  
 
Table IX  Electoral Prediction for MQM 
 Tweets Pro Pred. Anti Pred. 
8th May 16 12% 88% 
9th May 20 15% 85% 
10th May 39 7% 93% 
11th May 117 16% 84% 
 
As can be seen, PTI has the highest percentage of Pro 
predictions for each day, which considerably outnumber the 
Pro predictions for both PMLN and MQM. Consequently, 
both PMLN and MQM have very high Anti predictions. These 
results clearly show that twitter sentiments predict PTI as the 
winning party, and at the same time, predict PMLN and MQM 
to lose heavily. In order to further verify our results, we 
manually labeled the tweets in each test matrix (as Pro or 
Anti) and compared these labels with the predicted ones. The 
results are shown in Table X. We made manual Anti 
predictions for MQM and PMLN, and manual Pro prediction 
for PTI. Also, the predictions are expressed as average over 4 
days (8th-11th May). We can see that the Pro prediction is still 
the highest for PTI, followed by PMLN and the MQM. This 
result strongly reinforces our statement that Twitter sentiments 
predict PTI as the winning party. Nevertheless, we do observe 
a drastic increase in the Pro prediction for PMLN, which 
signals a type of “bias” in learning. However, this bias is 
associated with the users’ sentiments, and may required 
extensive experimentation with different parameters and 
algorithms (which is outside the scope of this work).

Manual Avg. Actual 
PTI Pro Prediction 76% 99%

        As the elections are already over, we must comment that 
the actual winning party was PMLN (with respect to seats in 
the top-level National Assembly), followed by PPP (which 
was not at all focused on Twitter), PTI, and finally MQM 
(refer to http://hamariweb.com/pakistan-election-2013/). 
However, PTI achieved landslide victory in the Khyber 
Pakhtunkhaa province, and grabbed seats from several 
important constituencies across the country. Moreover, PTI 
supporters issued rigging complaints from the NA-250 
constituency, in which re-election lead to PTI victory. From 
this, we derive the following conclusions: 
• The educated category of political analysts was 
primarily supporting PTI, possibly because of the 
party’s vision to implement reforms in a better way 
than the other parties. 
• Notwithstanding our limited number of Twitter users 
and their tweets, our predictions are still valid for one 
whole province. 
• From a generic perspective, Twitter users do not 
represent the significant voting population of 
Pakistan. 
• Twitter may not always significantly impact election 
results, as PPP won without any considerable Twitter 
usage. 
Recall from Section II that many electoral predictions using 
Twitter were not exactly precise [17]. However, our message 
in this paper is that Twitter did create a unifying community 
of PTI supporters which did have some type of positive impact 
on the result. In other words, the use of social networking can 
have a large say in determining the election result, which is 
what we observed for the US Presidential 2012 Elections. 
 
VI. CONCLUSIONS  
      In this paper, we have used Twitter to predict the winning 
political party for the Election held in Pakistan in May 2013. 
The primary motivation was the positive impact which Twitter 
analysis had on helping Obama to win US Presidential 2012 
elections. We identified a number of relevant users (mainly 
political analysts), extracted their tweets, and the attributes 
most useful to gauge the positive and negative user 
sentiments. Using Rapid Miner, we learnt decision tree 
predictive models with the CHAID algorithm, as it had better 
predictive accuracy compared to two other standard 
algorithms, i.e., Naïve Bayes and Support Vector Machines. 
We extracted useful rules regarding tweeting trends associated 
with positive and negative opinions. Our predictions reveal 
PTI to win the elections. In reality, even though PMLN was 
the actual winner, PTI did obtain a landslide victory in one 
province, and bagged other important seats across the country. 
Our results demonstrate the importance of Twitter in creating 
some type of positive impact for winning elections, which is 
reminiscent of Obama’s victory in US 2012 elections. 
However, in Pakistan, Twitter alone cannot be relied heavily 
for electoral prediction due to its developing Pakistani user-
 base. Our study does not include the opinions of the rural 
population of Pakistan which runs in large numbers.
