AbstractÑA huge amount of microarray datasets are produced 
with big number of genes and small samples. Feature selection 
methods have become a very sharp tool to select the gene 
signatures from the whole gene set. In recent years, 
researchers are concerned much about the datasets containing 
samples of cancer as well as corresponding control tissues. 
However, few feature selection methods consider the effect of 
paired samples. In this article, we propose a new feature 
selection method for paired microarray datasets based on the 
original paired t-test approach. We apply on the paired 
datasets across six common cancer types. Through comparison 
with some widely used methods on the performance of 
prediction power, stability of gene lists and functional stability, 
our method shows excellent performance. The proposed 
method has good effectiveness, stability and consistency, which 
enables the method to be applicative to feature selection for 
paired microarray expression data analysis.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Now, a large number of microarray related data have 
been obtained such as the datasets in GEO. However, most 
of them have small number of samples and tens of thousands 
of genes. The high dimensionality will hinder extracting 
useful information effectively and robustly. Feature selection 
technique can be used to select a subset of relevant features 
by eliminating redundant, irrelevant and noisy features. 
However, complex wrapper and embedded methods have 
higher computational complexity than filter methods, and 
they generally do not outperform simple filter methods [1]. 
Over the past decade, lots of filter methods have been 
developed. In 1999, Golub et al. [2] presented a filter method 
for cancer classification based on correlation coefficient 
ranking. Callow et al. [3] applied a two-sample t-statistic 
filter method to remove irrelevant genes and identify 
significant genes with altered expression. Huber et al. [4] 
used a two-sample permutation t-test to detect differential 
expression genes and remove irrelevant genes of the dataset. 
Deng et al. [5] proposed a rank sum test method for 
informative gene discovery. Ding et al. [6] proposed a 
minimum redundancy-maximum relevance (MRMR) filter 
feature selection framework. But there are few feature 
selection methods which considered the impact of paired 
samples. So, in this paper, the proposed method mainly 
focuses on the gene signature identification from the paired 
microarray data. 
Firstly, an improved paired t-test method based on 
original method [7] is used to calculate the statistical 
significant between samples and genes. In the second step, 
we calculate the q-value of False Discovery Rate for each 
gene in terms of the p-value obtained from the improved 
paired t-test. Finally, Pearson correlation coefficient is used 
to decrease the redundant genes in the gene list and the final 
gene ranking is generated by optimizing the q-value and the 
redundancy score. We evaluate the method on effectiveness 
and stability by using microarray datasets of six types of 
cancers. When evaluated on different datasets of the same 
cancer, the mean accuracies of the method by SVM classifier 
on these datasets for top 100 genes are 81.85%, 93.92%, 
94.27%, 60.63%, 98.65% and 68.89%, respectively. Then, 
we also evaluate the stability of gene ranking lists and the 
functional stability. The results of the proposed method are 
more stable than the other existing methods. 
II. METHODS 
A. Data Sources 
Six types of cancer gene expression datasets from GEO 
are used in this paper to measure the performance of feature 
selection methods. In order to obtain the samples of tumor 
and adjacent non-tumor tissues, we select the subset of each 
dataset. 43 paired samples of breast cancer from GSE15852 
are used as training dataset for breast cancer and 57 paired 
samples from four datasets are used as test datasets. The 
datasets information of lung, colon, gastric, liver and 
pancreatic cancers are also summarized in Table I. 
B. Improved Paired t-test by Fold Change 
For the paired microarray datasets, we have the gene 
expression values of n pairs with sample number j (j = 1, 
2, É, n). Although the expression values of most datasets are 
usually preprocessed by log scale, in this article, we only use 
the original expression data which have not been normalized 
by logarithm. In original statistic method of paired t-test, for 
each gene i (i = 1, 2, ..., m) in gene expression data, the 
differential expression value of sample pair j is obtained 
using the subtraction in gene expression data between cancer 
sample j and normal sample j [7]. The formula is shown as 
follows: 
ij ij ij
 d C N= ?                                      (1)

*Subsets of the dataset are selected as different cancer datasets 
where 
ij
 C  and 
ij
 N  (i = 1, ..., m and j = 1, É, n) are the 
expression values of gene i in cancer and normal samples of 
patient j, respectively. Then the paired t-test can be 
calculated using the following formulas:

However, since different datasets have different 
experimental environment and conditions, the subtracting 
method does not have good stability and generalization 
ability across different datasets. Therefore, we improve the 
computing process of distance

The

value by fold change. 
C. Statistical Significance 
Here we use the approach proposed by Storey and 
Tibshirani in 2003 to measure statistical significance of each 
gene. The method measures statistical significance by q-
 value based on the concept of the False Discovery Rate 
(FDR) and offers a sensible balance between the number of 
true and false positives. In this article, we calculate the q-
 value for each gene in terms of the p-value obtained from the 
improved paired t-test. 
D. Decreasing Redundant Genes 
In this article, the redundancy of a gene subset is 
determined by the Pearson correlation coefficient among the 
genes. The formula of Pearson correlation coefficient is 
defined as follows: 
2 2 2 2
 ( , )
 ( ) ( )
 j j j j
 j j j j
 n x y x y
 P x y
 n x x n y y

where x and y are two vectors of expression values on two 
genes, and n is the number of samples. Then, the redundancy 
of a gene i with other genes in the subset S is defined as: 
, ,
 1 1
 ( , )* ( , )
 1 1i N Cj S i j j S i j

where ( , )

 P i j  and ( , )

 P i j  are the Pearson correlation 
coefficients between gene i and gene j in normal and cancer 
samples. N is the number of genes in subset S. 
In our method, the final gene ranking is generated by 
optimizing the ratio of the logarithm of q-valueÕs reciprocal 
of a gene and the redundancy of the gene in the set. The 
optimizing process is similar as mRMR and the formula is 
shown as follows:

III. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
In this paper, the evaluation process is performed using 
our proposed feature selection method based on filter, 
denoted by Ôpfcc-ttestÕ in the following discussion section. 
At the meantime, six widely used feature selected methods 
are selected to make the comparative analysis. They are the 
original paired t-test, ttest2, SNR, two-sample permutation t-
 test (denoted by ÔpttestÕ), the rank sum test method 
(RankSum) and the minimum redundancy-maximum 
relevance (mRMR) filter method. 
A. Performance of Classification Capability 
We evaluate the accuracy of different methods on the 
multiple datasets of the same cancer type. For each cancer 
type, take breast cancer as an example, we carry out each 
method on the training dataset GSE15852 to get the gene list. 
Then the top 100 genes are selected to build a SVM-based 
classifier. The test sets consist of four datasets GSE10810, 
GSE16873, GSE5764 and GSE14548. The top 100 gene 
prediction results of all the methods are illustrated in Fig.1. 
Viewed as a whole, we can see that the prediction 
accuracies of our proposed method are better than others on 
most datasets, especially for the liver, lung, colon and breast 
cancer datasets. The curves of the accuracy are much higher 
than the others. Meanwhile, ttest2 and paired t-test methods 
also perform well on liver dataset, but not good in others. We 
have also calculated the mean accuracy of our method. The 
mean accuracies of the method by SVM classifier on these 
datasets for top 100 genes are 81.85%, 93.92%, 94.27%, 
60.63%, 98.65% and 68.89%, respectively. For the other 
methods, take pttest method as an example, it has better 
performance with the top 7 genes and nearly 73% accuracy 
in gastric cancer dataset, but performs poorer in other 
datasets. The performance of our method on the multiple 
datasets evaluation has illustrated its effectiveness in feature 
selection.

B. Stability of Gene Signatures 
The stability of the gene lists generated by feature 
selection methods reflects the robustness of these methods. 
In this part, we mainly focus on the similarity of the gene 
lists produced by the feature selection methods. Take liver 
cancer as an example, we generate 10 subsets from 
GSE22058 by randomly choosing 80% of the paired 
samples and get 10 gene lists by using the feature selection 
methods in this paper. In order to make the statistical 
analysis easier and more significant, the top 500 genes of 
each gene list are selected to do the following analysis: 
a) Compute the stability value: the ratio of overlap gene 
number and the number of union genes between the 10 gene 
lists as the stability value. 
The methods with the bigger ratio value will have better 
stability of the gene lists. Fig. 2 shows the ratio results and 
their corresponding histogram. It can be seen that our 
proposed method has very good performance on the datasets. 
It gets the biggest ratio values on four datasets except for 
GSE15852 and GSE19804, and they are much bigger than 
those from other methods. But the ratio value in GSE19804 
is very close (nearly equal) to the ratio of the ttest2 method. 
Meanwhile, the pttest method performs worst among all the 
methods. The mean value of the ratios is also shown in Fig.2. 
Our method gets 0.634 on average, which is far better than 
those from other methods and shows better stability of the 
method. The SNR and RankSum methods rank second and 
third by their mean ratio scores, but their performance differ 
too much on different datasets, which indicates that it does 
not have a good consistency. The assessment results show 
that our proposed method performs well and has a good 
stability of gene signatures.

b) Compute the average value of the ratio of intersection 
and union of every two gene lists as the stability value. 
The methods with the bigger average value will have 
better stability of the gene lists. Table II shows the average 
values for the ratios of every two gene lists. We can see that 
our method produces the biggest average values on five 
datasets except for GSE15852, and the values are much 
bigger than those from other methods. Meanwhile, the pttest 
method performs worst among all the datasets. The mean of 
the average values is also shown in the table, and our method 
gets 0.849, which is far better than the other methods. The 
SNR and RankSum methods rank second and third by their 
mean scores, but they are lacking in consistency among 
different datasets. Through comparison, our proposed 
method performs well among the feature selection methods, 
and has consistency and stability of the gene signatures. 
C. Functional Stability 
The functional stability of the selected genes is carried 
out using DAVID. We choose threshold of Benjamini value 
less than 0.05 to get GO terms. At first, we use the same 
procedure to get the 10 gene lists and their top ten GO terms 
from DAVID. Then, for each pair of the 10 gene lists we 
compute the average ratio value of overlapping gene number 
and the number of union genes between the GO terms of two 
gene lists. Finally, the mean value of these average ratio 
values is calculated as the functional stability score.  
The methods with the bigger score will have better 
functional stability. Table III shows GO term analysis of 
functional stability by mean value. We can see that our 
proposed method has better performance on the datasets. It 
produces the biggest mean values on five datasets except for 
GSE15852, and they are much bigger than the other methods. 
The mean values among the different datasets are also shown 
in the last line in the table, and our method gets 0.899, which 
is far better than those from other methods. Meanwhile, we 
notice that RankSum and paired t-test methods rank second 
and third by their scores, but they are lacking in consistency 
among different datasets. Through comparison with other 
methods, it is demonstrated that our proposed method 
performs well on the functional stability analysis. 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
Feature selection methods play an important role in the 
gene expression data analysis. In this paper, we propose an 
effective, stable and easily used approach to select gene 
signatures. We improve the original paired t-test method by 
replacing the subtracting step with a new strategy of using 
fold change value. The q-value of False Discovery Rate is 
also used to calculate the statistical significant in place of the 
original p-value. Meanwhile, we apply a strategy of 
decreasing the redundant genes to reduce the influence of the 
redundant genes. We execute our method on the datasets of 
six most cancer types. In the performance measurement, we 
focus on 1) the accuracy assessment on the multiple datasets; 
2) the stability of the gene list assessment; 3) the functional 
stability assessment. Through comparison with other 
methods, the proposed method shows good performance of 
the accuracy and stability on most of these datasets, which 
supports us to believe that the proposed method is quite 
promising and has an applicative capability of feature 
selection for paired microarray expression data analysis.
