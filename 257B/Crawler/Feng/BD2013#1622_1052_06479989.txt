Abstract 
This paper continues to test the ASSANA 
methodology for the computer-assisted analysis of 
large-scale, unstructured, text-based data in 
international affairs research. Traditional 
methodologies for exploring the role of the Secretary 
of State in projecting “soft power” have focused on 
reading and analyzing texts to uncover important 
themes and patterns.  However, the increasingly 
large volume of data available presents a significant 
challenge for these traditional methods of analysis. 
We examine three data sets consisting of every 
remark by Secretary Clinton since taking office 
(n=2,438), Secretary Rice from 2005-2009 
(n=1,766), and Secretary Albright from 1997-2001 
(n=1,335). We use computer-assisted content 
analysis to find key themes for each Secretary and 
search for similarities between key themes and 
phrases. We find a limited number of similar 
keywords across the dataset, except International and 
Issues. However, the following phrases are shared 
between all Secretaries: Human Rights, Foreign 
Policy, Middle East, International Community, and 
North Korea.  
 
 
1. Introduction  
 
The United States is a unique case study in 
foreign policy. As the world’s leading economic and 
military powerhouse it plays a critical role in foreign 
affairs but has preferred historically to eschew many 
long-term international entanglements. Throughout 
its rise to become the world’s only remaining 
superpower, US ideals and values have shaped its 
foreign policy through promoting freedom and 
democracy around the world. The Monroe Doctrine 
aligned America with an “open door” policy as well, 
increasing its international presence and pressure on 
authoritarian regimes and governments [12].  
However, as the events of September 11 
illustrated vividly, the American image and actions  
Amy Wozniak

abroad have very real security and prosperity 
consequences at home. As Frederic McCormick 
states in his 1911 piece, “If [a nation] has no great 
foreign affairs it will not only lack greatness, but it 
will also be incapable in some of the essentials of 
nationality” [12].  
The Department of State is the primary foreign 
policy agency within the United States. The US has 
embassies, consulates, and diplomatic relations with 
countries spreading from Iceland to Japan, which 
carry out international policy functions. At the top of 
this organization sits the Secretary of State, the 
United States’ highest official in foreign affairs. The 
Secretary of State serves as an American spokesman, 
foreign policy creator, and international negotiator. 
The Department of State’s Mission is to, “Shape and 
sustain a peaceful, prosperous, just, and democratic 
world and foster conditions for stability and progress 
for the benefit of the American people and people 
everywhere” [5]. 
Recently, international relations scholars have 
asked questions about the role of the Secretary of 
State in projecting “soft power” and the differences 
in scope, focus, and tone, based on venue and 
audience [4]; [11]; [13]. However, the large volume 
of text-based data now becoming available, presents 
a significant challenge for traditional methods of 
social science analysis. Most scholars confronted 
with this “data deluge” [14] have been confined to 
smaller samples of her speeches because of time and 
resource constraints.  Further, we can identify no 
systematic study of the impact of female Secretaries 
of State in the United States.  As Berman and Brady 
note, social scientists recognize the promise of using 
large-scale digital data to answer important research 
questions, but frequently do not have the skills or 
infrastructure to capitalize on them. Many social 
scientists trained only in traditional methods of 
qualitative analysis, and even those using computer 
assisted qualitative data analysis software 
(CAQDAS) software, find it difficult to cope with the 
time and effort required to analyze these large data 
sources [2]. New texts are emerging to help train 
non-specialists on these techniques [15].

The US Government is also promoting the use of 
Big Data and web based tools to enhance 
transparency and openness. The State Department has 
taken the unprecedented step of making every single 
public statement by the Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton, both inside and outside the country, 
available for download on their website 
(http://www.state.gov/). There are also archived sites 
where former Secretaries Rice and Albright’s 
remarks can be found. These and other similar efforts 
across government to enhance participation, such as 
the Open Government Initiative 
(http://www.whitehouse.gov/open) and Data.gov 
(http://data.gov/), are yielding voluminous amounts 
of digital data that could be analyzed by social 
scientists.  However, in most cases these data are 
either ignored or underutilized because of their 
relative magnitude.  
 
2. Purpose  
 
The purpose of this paper is to further test 
components of an integrated methodology we call 
ASSANA - Accelerating Social Science Analysis 
for a New Age in which computational tools are used 
to assist in the analysis of large-scale, unstructured, 
text-based data focused on key questions in 
international affairs research.  To do so, we used 
QDA Miner (computer-assisted qualitative data 
analysis software - CAQDAS - application) and 
WordStat (a computer aided data mining - CADM - 
tool) to analyze every remark made by Secretaries 
Clinton, Rice, and Albright during their tenures in 
office.  Our two overarching goals are to: 
 
1. Identify the key themes and issues of each 
Secretary of State during their tenure and to explore 
any similarities or differences arising between them, 
and; 
 
2. Better understand the potential of computer-
 assisted analytical tools, particularly CAQDAS and 
CADM, for analyzing large-scale, text-based 
data.       
The following sections of this paper review the 
relevant literature review, describe our conceptual 
framework, present our research questions, and 
methodology. We then outline our findings for each 
research question, and discuss their implications. We 
conclude with the limitations of this study, and areas 
for future research. Our goal is to explore the efficacy 
of ASSANA for analyzing larger, more complex data 
sets in a way that we hope will encourage other 
international relations scholars to do the same. 
3. Literature Review  
 
Recently, women have held important foreign 
policy positions within the United States 
administrations. Since former President Bill Clinton 
nominated Madeleine Albright in 1997 as the first 
female Secretary of State, Colin Powell has been the 
only male to hold the position. President Barack 
Obama has not only had Hillary Clinton as his 
Secretary of State, but also nominated Susan Rice as 
the US Ambassador to the United Nations, as well as 
nominated two female Supreme Court justices. These 
women have inserted themselves into a political 
domain historically dominated by white males 
throughout history. Madeleine Albright and Secretary 
Clinton share close personal connections; Albright 
was Secretary of State during President Clinton’s 
second term, a job that Hillary Clinton, then first 
lady, now holds. Condoleezza Rice was nominated 
by former Republican President George W. Bush, 
after Colin Powell lost much of his credibility after 
backing the Iraq War. 
As Secretary of State, these women have held a 
strong influence on the US foreign policy message. A 
2009 study by Goldsmith and Horiuchi examined the 
effects of high level visits on foreign public opinion 
[6]. Through analysis of secondary survey data based 
on affect towards the US after September 2011, the 
authors found that leaders have the ability to frame 
events for foreign publics within these visits, but the 
effect of the frame can be short-lived and depends on 
multiple variables. The one main concept identified 
by the authors that can influence the effect of the 
frame is the credibility of the speaker [6].  Secretary 
Clinton has been considered a highly effective 
Secretary of State and a credible, high-level official, 
making her a top candidate to have influence over 
foreign publics, and the ability to frame an issue 
favorably for the US [8]. However, when 
Condoleezza Rice was Secretary of State she 
inherited the Iraq War blunder which cost her 
predecessor his credibility which could have caused 
her less influence. Although these three women were 
in different administrations, any consistencies or 
differences between their remarks will lead to a more 
comprehensive and larger picture of US foreign 
policy initiatives.  
Madeleine Albright reflected on the issue of 
gender and foreign policy in an article for the SAIS 
Review titled Women in American Foreign Policy in 
2000. She was the first female Secretary of State, and 
one of the highest ranking females in an American 
administration throughout its history. In the year 
2000 her thoughts were that the questions 
surrounding females in foreign policy should be “put 
12681270
to rest.” Her ability to conduct foreign policy and 
international relations was not hampered by the 
subject of her gender. Within her article Secretary 
Albright states that the plight of women worldwide 
was also one of her main issues, and would become a 
part of US foreign policy efforts [1]. Current 
Secretary Hillary Clinton has also been seen as 
promoting the rights of women and girls worldwide 
as well. During our analysis, any keywords relating 
to women and girls or women’s rights would be 
consistent with Secretary Albright’s prior statements. 
Other assumptions made by scholars when 
discussing women in foreign policy include that 
women are more pacifist than men, and their views 
tend to be more moderate. According to Rhodri 
Jeffreys-Jones in Changing Differences women tend 
to have more pacifist views than men, and therefore 
support peace proposals and historically have called 
for peace more often than men [7].  Also, according 
to Dr. Kevin Lasher, one of Secretary Albright’s 
main goals as Secretary of State was to make 
Americans believe “foreign policy was important in 
their lives,” portraying a focus on the domestic 
audience, and not just a foreign audience. Lasher also 
points to the fact that Madeleine Albright and 
Condoleezza Rice were the best spokesmen for US 
foreign policy portraying the ability to speak well and 
be understood as a desirable character for Secretary
 of State. Lasher states that for Condoleezza Rice, 
“US Foreign policy should proceed from the 
foundation of the national interest, not from the 
interests of a hypothetical international community”
 [9]. So while Albright might have focused on the 
importance of international engagement to domestic 
audiences, Rice’s focus was on the national interest.  
A study on the key themes and issues of these
 female Secretaries of State will allow us to examine 
consistencies or differences in US foreign policy 
trends across a lengthy time period. This study will 
also help advance the argument for Big Data 
analytics in the social sciences and lend support to 
the role of computer-assisted content analysis and 
data-mining within large datasets. 
4. Conceptual Framework   
The research domain of public diplomacy is built 
upon earlier scholarship on “propaganda” and 
political persuasion. Harold Lowell defines 
propaganda as the, “management of collective 
attitudes by the manipulation of significant symbols”
 [10]. In short, propaganda is a tool to influence 
collective attitudes through communication 
instruments. From World War II propaganda, to Cold 
War spheres of influence, to modern-day facebook 
and Twitter accounts, governments acknowledge and 
are actively involved in influencing foreign publics 
through communication. This process is now 
currently recognized as public diplomacy within the 
US government. 
Secretaries of State provide a vital function of 
leadership by informing and influencing foreign 
publics when giving remarks domestically or 
internationally. The Secretary is the spokesperson of 
US foreign policy, and due to her status as a high 
level official, the major themes and issues from his or 
her speeches can be seen as an indicator of policy 
priorities for the United States.  It is important to 
examine these remarks as a whole in order to better 
understand the function they play in public 
diplomacy efforts, as well as to specifically identify 
what consistencies and differences there are among 
US administrations. More specifically, we are 
interested in whether these key messages promoted 
by the Secretaries of State are consistent or dynamic 
across time.  Figure 1. below illustrates this basic 
conceptual framework that will drive our research 
questions. 
 
Figure 1. Conceptual Framework 
5. Research Questions  
Based on our prior research and literature 
review, we ask the following questions of these three 
datasets:  
1) What are the most important keywords and 
phrases used by each Secretary during their tenure?  
2) What are the similarities between the important 
keywords and phrases of each Secretary of State 
when compared to each other?

6. Methodology  
This study is part of a large, multi-tiered project 
called Accelerating Social Science Analysis for a 
New Age (ASSANA).  ASSANA is designed to 
develop, refine, and disseminate a methodology for 
social scientists to use computer-intensive software to 
engage large-N studies.  The complete ASSANA 
methodology uses four stages, each driven by a 
different approach to analyzing the large, 
unstructured, text-based data.  The strengths of each 
approach will be harnessed to yield greater insights 
than that approach would yield alone.  We will then 
compare the findings generated by these four 
approaches, and determine the differences in time, 
consistency in findings, and research questions 
answered.  Figure 2 below represents the modified 
ASSANA workflow for this study. 
 
Figure 2. Modified ASSANA Workflow 
 
 
The four approaches used in ASSANA are 
described below, from least computationally 
intensive to most computationally intensive. 
1. Traditional: Traditional hand-coding and 
content analysis where a researcher reads 
each observation of source material, reflects, 
makes notes, and develops subject codes 
along the way. 
2. CAQDAS: Computer Assisted Qualitative 
Data Analysis Software. Enables faster 
hand-coding and automatic data cleanup.  
3. CADM: Computer Assisted Data-Mining 
and Content Analysis software. Statistical 
and algorithmic analysis of text to look for 
patterns. 
4. High Performance Data Mining: Content 
analysis in a High Performance Computing 
Environment using R/tm.  
 
For this study, we use only two of the four stages 
of the ASSANA methodology: (2) CAQDAS and (3) 
CADM, in order to examine each Secretary’s 
remarks for key themes and issues that arise and any 
consistencies or differences between each Secretary. 
This paper reports on the qualitative data analysis, 
including the computer assisted content and keyword 
analysis.
 6.1. Data Collection 
The datasets for this paper consist of every 
remark made by Secretaries Albright, Rice and 
Clinton during their time in office. It was compiled 
using an automated web-scraping program called 
SiteSucker (http://www.sitesucker.us/).  To collect 
the data, the program was ran to create a project 
folder going down 6 Levels in order to retrieve the 
correct text from the US State Department website, 
http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/index.htm/, as well 
as the archived sites for Secretary Rice: http://2001-
 2009.state.gov/ and Secretary Albright: http://1997-
 2001.state.gov/.  As an example, the data collection 
for Secretary Clinton resulted in a folder structure 
beginning with “rm” which lists each year (2009-
 2012), and nested folders underneath each year for 
every month (1-12). The speech files are then 
contained in html format under each monthly folder.
 At the time of this paper submission the Secretary 
Clinton dataset is currently 2,438 cases. Secretary 
Rice’s dataset includes 1,766 speeches, and Secretary 
Albright’s dataset includes 1,335 speeches.  
6.2. Computer Assisted Content Analysis 
The analysis for this project utilizes two software 
programs within the Provalis Research Suite, QDA 
Miner and WordStat 
(http://www.provalisresearch.com/). This software 
allows for coding of key variables for the study, and 
calculation of frequency of words and phrases, and 
keyword-in-context retrieval.  A more detailed 
analysis of this data will take place later, but this

initial analysis of the data has proved to be very 
interesting. 
In order to begin the analysis, the data was first 
converted from html text into individual cases using 
the Document Conversion Wizard within QDA 
Miner. The Document Conversion Wizard is run 
from QDA Miner upon creation of a new project. 
One can then choose the HTML files that are to be 
converted into cases.  Once all the files are chosen, 
the researcher can then specify parameters for 
importation of the data in order capture the remarks 
without extra html code. For our purposes within the 
Clinton Dataset, the beginning delimiter was 
specified as “Subscribe to Updates,” while the end 
delimiter was “What’s New.” This allowed the 
researchers to capture the section of text that was 
required for analysis as a separate document variable, 
and limited the amount of cleaning of the data 
required. 
The data analysis techniques used in this paper 
are described here briefly, but can be explored more 
deeply by going to the website of the mixed methods 
software used in the 
analysis  (http://provalisresearch.com/).  QDA Miner 
is part of a comprehensive mixed methods data 
analysis software suite from Provalis Research 
(http://www.provalisresearch.com/).  This mixed 
methods suite contains three integrated applications, 
including: (1) QDA Miner – a computer assisted 
qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS); (2) 
WordStat – for content analysis and text mining; and; 
(3) SimStat for statistical analysis.  In this project, we 
used QDA Miner, as well as WordStat. 
       Consistent with our conceptual framework, we 
see the public remarks of US Secretaries of State as 
being an explicit attempt to shape public opinion, 
especially when speaking abroad and to foreign 
publics.  So as a result, what Secretaries choose to 
include in their public remarks helps to frame events 
and signal important areas of focus for US foreign 
policy.  
       In order to uncover the key themes contained in 
each Secretary's speeches, we repeated an approach 
from an earlier paper examining Secretary Clinton’s 
speeches only [3]. This approach determines 
important keywords and phrases as ones used most 
frequently, as well as that occur in the largest 
percentage of cases.  For the purposes of this paper, 
our assumption is that words and phrases that are 
used frequently are sending important signals to 
frame a debate about the desired approach to 
international affairs.  An Exclusion Dictionary was 
also used to extract extraneous keywords before the 
analysis occurred.  These extraneous words include 
most pronouns and other expected spurious 
words.  We also set the system parameters to only 
identify words that were not included in every case 
(we assumed these words would likely be artifacts of 
the formatting – e.g., used in the URL). This 
frequency analysis yielded very interesting 
exploratory observations that are reported on below. 
Of course, we recognize that there is a broader 
context within which each word or phrase is used, but 
our initial set of research questions explored in this 
paper focused on understanding the broad contours of 
what was “important” across a very large dataset of 
speeches.  Subsequent research will deepen this 
analysis. 
To be more specific, during this research we 
used the Content Analysis tools within WordStat to 
identify and visualize those words that were used 
most frequently occurring within the entire dataset. 
Since “importance” of words and concepts was our 
overarching concern, we consider a keyword to be 
“important” if it is within the top 15 most frequently 
used keywords in the dataset, and if it occurs within 
the top 15 keywords by case percentage. However, 
what we report on in our findings is an integrated 
listing of words and terms, because the two 
measurements combined produce a more valid 
measurement of importance, because it is possible 
that a keyword that is used frequently may only be 
contained within one, or a small number of cases.  So 
a keyword or phrase that occurs with both high 
frequency and across multiple cases is more likely to 
be important.  
A second tool within WordStat, Phrase Finder, 
was then used to identify the most frequently 
occurring phrases within the dataset. We set the 
system parameters to only report those phrases that 
contained a minimum of 2 words, a maximum of 5 
words, and appear in a minimum of 3 cases. The 
results were then sorted by frequency and case 
percentage, similar to the process we used with 
keywords. The key phrases is an important second 
step in our analysis, as we are able to see that 
although Human and Rights might be frequently 
occurring keywords, we cannot say that the speaker 
means Human Rights. Phrase Finder adds a second 
dimension to the analysis of our datasets by allowing 
researchers to uncover further themes without having 
to read the entire dataset of speeches. Our findings 
are detailed below, along with figures from the 
content analysis. 
The computer-assisted methodology is important 
to use and document in order to learn more about 
how these techniques help to analyze Big Data. One 
of the most important aspects of the content analysis 
tools is they allow the researcher to gather 
information about the whole dataset, no matter how 
12713
large, without having to read the entire set of 
documents. Sampling the dataset for closer inspection 
can be done after the computer-assisted content 
analysis, and then compared to the earlier findings in 
order to see if they are consistent or differ in their 
findings.  
 
7. Findings  
 
The first research question (RQ1) of this paper 
asks, “What are the most important keywords and 
phrases used by each Secretary during their tenure as 
Secretary of State?” To answer the first part of this 
question we used QDA Miner and WordStat, to 
perform a keyword frequency by case analysis on 
each dataset.  As an illustration, Figures 3 and 4 
illustrates the keywords used by Secretary Clinton. 
 
Figure 3. Secretary Clinton’s Important 
Keywords by Frequency 
 
 
Figure 4. Secretary Clinton’s Important 
Keywords by Case Percentage 
 
 
From the figures above we see that the most 
important keywords for Clinton are: 
 Economic  
 International 
 Future 
 Issues  
 Peace 
 Rights  
 Human 
 Progress 
We followed this procedure for each Secretary of 
State to identify their important keywords. Figures 5-
 8 illustrate the keywords for Rice and Albright.

To answer the second part of this research 
question we used QDA Miner and WordStat, to 
perform a phrase frequency by case analysis on each 
dataset. Again as an illustration, Figures 5 and 6

Our second research question (RQ2) asks, “What 
are the similarities between the important keywords 
and phrases of each Secretary of State when 
compared to each other?”  
There are a limited number of keyword 
similarities between all three Secretaries, with 
International and Issues being the only common 
keywords. Secretary Rice does not share any unique 
keywords with either Secretary Albright or Secretary 
Clinton; however Secretary Albright and Secretary 
Clinton share the keyword Peace together. 
There seems to be more similarities between the 
Secretaries and the phrases they use. All three 
Secretaries share Human Rights, Foreign Policy, 
Middle East, International Community, and North 
Korea as important keywords. Secretary Albright and 
Secretary Rice share Saddam Hussein, while Albright 
and Secretary Clinton share Rule of Law. Secretaries 
Rice and Clinton also share Nuclear Weapons and 
European Union as well. 
 
8. Discussion  
 
At first look, it does not seem like the Secretaries 
of State have been consistent with their messaging 
since only basic words like International and Issues 
are common amongst them. However when 
comparing the phrases we find much more 
commonality. It seems to show that Human Rights, 
the Middle East, and North Korea have been 
common foreign policy goals since at least 1997. 
This shows us that although administrations may 
change, and even political parties, there are some 
consistent themes in foreign policy. We can say that 
the Middle East and North Korea are the main 
important region and state that the United States is 
consistently concerned with, however the European 
Union showing up as a common phrase between 
Secretary Rice and Clinton shows that this is an up 
and coming important region as well. This also tells 
us that a large portion of the United States foreign 
policy is concerned with Human Rights. Since this 
phrase has been consistent for almost 12 years, it can 
be said this is an important message from the United 
States. Another finding is the consistency of 
12746
International Community across all Secretaries. This 
is particularly interesting in Secretary Rice’s case 
since her previous statements include conducting 
foreign policy based on the national interest, and not 
the international community.  
Some of the more interesting findings come from 
what is unique about each Secretaries important 
keywords and phrases. For instance, Secretary 
Albright has Mass Destruction and Weapons of Mass 
Destruction as two of her most important phrases, 
however these words are not found in Secretary 
Rice’s important phrases. This could be a conscious 
effort by Secretary Rice to not use Weapons of Mass 
Destruction after it was found that Iraq never had 
them. There is also a commonality between Secretary 
Albright and Secretary Rice in that they share 
Saddam Hussein in their important phrases. This 
supports the fact that the Iraqi nation and its former 
leader was a key point in foreign policy from as early 
as 1997 up until 2005, a span of at least eight years. 
Secretary Rice also has some of the most politically 
charged keywords and phrases, more so than 
Secretaries Albright and Clinton. Three of Secretary 
Rice’s keywords are Democracy, Political, and 
Democratic. This could show that she felt a very 
politically motivated purpose to foreign policy. 
Another unique finding from the Rice dataset is that 
the Soviet Union is one of the important phrases for 
Secretary Rice. Since the Soviet Union collapsed in 
1990, it is interesting this phrase comes up most 
frequently, and within a high percentage of her 
speeches. Further keyword in context analysis should 
lead to more explanations for the appearance of this 
phrase so frequently. Talk is another unique keyword 
for Secretary Rice as well, denoting an open mind 
towards dialogue and communication within her 
foreign policy messages.  
Secretary Clinton separates herself from the 
previous female Secretaries of State as well. She is 
the only Secretary with keywords of Future, 
Progress, and Economic denoting a difference in how 
she views her position from the others. Future is an 
interesting keyword; it could note that she sees 
foreign policy as being a long-term investment, or 
that the United States should be more forward 
looking in their foreign policy initiatives. Or she 
wants to convey to other nations that the US is 
thinking about the future, and not staying in the 
present. Progress is also interesting. It is a word that 
can carry a negative connotation for some people 
within the United States, such as conservatives. 
However, again keeping in mind the Secretary of 
State is usually speaking to a foreign audience, she 
could be lauding foreign publics for their progress, or 
pushing foreign countries to make more progress 
democratically, or within the human rights realm. 
Finally, she is the only Secretary to use Economic as 
well. This could be a product of our times, when 
most of the world is embroiled in economic 
recessions; it could also note the ever-increasing 
globalization of the world’s economic ties and its 
shared ups and downs. Secretary Clinton and 
Secretary Albright share the keyword Peace with 
each other, while this is not part of Secretary Rice’s 
keywords. This could be confirming Jeffreys-Jones’s 
statement that women tend to be more pacifists, but 
Rice would not fit within the mold since Peace was 
not within her keywords. It could have to do with 
ideological differences between Democrat and 
Republican administrations, or it could be due to the 
fact that Secretary Rice was trying to manage public 
opinion on the two ongoing wars in the Middle East, 
Afghanistan and Iraq. Mentioning Peace might be 
seen as hypocritical while being involved in two 
conflicts. Secretaries Albright and Clinton also share 
Rule of Law, as a common phrase while Secretary 
Rice does not. This might be a conscious decision 
since many foreign populations saw the invasion of 
Iraq as unlawful, and Secretary Rice did not want to 
court controversy.  
Finally, Secretary Albright’s dataset had the least 
amount of speeches, but it still provides insight into 
her unique themes. Fact is the only keyword unique 
to Secretary Albright, which could possibly denote a 
pension for speaking the truth, or only imparting 
what is fact-based and not opinion based on her part. 
She does have unique phrases though, including 
Mass Destruction, Weapons of Mass Destruction, 
Cold War, and Chairman Arafat. Although currently 
most people would pair Weapons of Mass 
Destruction with a Secretary of State from the Bush 
administration, it was Secretary Albright who used 
the terminology most often. Secretary Albright’s use 
of the phrase Chairman Arafat is also telling, it shows 
that the Palestinian conflict was given much higher 
priority during the late 1990’s then it has been today. 
Palestine or any of its conjugations does not appear 
on either Secretary Clinton’s or Secretary Rice’s 
important keywords or phrases. This conflict has 
given way to Iraq and Afghanistan.  
Also interesting from the findings is there are no 
keywords or phrases relating to women, girls, or 
women’s rights as a foreign policy initiative. 
Although Secretary Albright discussed her wish to 
make a difference in the lives of women and girls 
across the developing world within her article in the 
SAIS Review, our findings are not consistent. None 
of the female secretaries had an important keyword 
or phrase relating to females leading us to believe 
that while women and girls might be an important 
12757
and emotional topic, it is not a top priority for US 
foreign policy.  
 
8. Limitations 
  
This paper has multiple limitations on its 
research. The datasets included are only for the three 
most recent female Secretaries of State and cannot be 
used to generalize an overall US foreign policy 
message. Also, there is a gap between the three 
female Secretaries filled by Secretary of State Colin 
Powell. For purposes of this paper, and in order to 
keep gender consistent across all datasets, Secretary 
Powell was not included.  
Another limitation is the lack of keyword in 
context analysis. Although these keywords and 
phrases are important due to their number of times 
used, as well as their appearance in a large percentage 
of cases, their context may differ. Further analysis of 
these important keywords and phrases will lead to 
deeper insights and more complex nuances.  
 
9. Future Research  
 
This study is an initial analysis on three separate 
datasets. Further contextual analysis can lead to 
deeper understandings of the frequently occurring 
keywords and phrases that are predominant from 
each Secretary. Keyword in context analysis will 
provide further unpacking and clearer definitions of 
what each keyword or phrase means when the 
Secretary uses it. A prior crosstabs analysis on the 
Secretary Clinton dataset provided further clues to 
the evolution of keywords and phrases over time and 
geography. This analysis will be completed on 
Secretary Rice and Secretary Albright’s datasets as 
well. Future analysis will include Secretary Powell’s 
tenure from 2001-2005 in order to see if his themes 
are consistent with those before and after his term.  
Future research will also include the final two 
approaches from the ASSANA Methodology; 
traditional hand coding as well as the High 
Performance Computing Environment. Incorporating 
these other approaches will allow for a full review of 
the differences in findings and time for analysis 
between each approach.
