HPC Cloud Bad; HPC in the Cloud Good

 Abstract:  
For most of the past two decades -- since the rise of clustering in the mid-1990s -- the HPC 
community has created its own IT components for deploying, managing, monitoring, and using 
horizontally-scaled resources to run its technical workloads. Historically, these tools have differed 
significantly from those used in commercial data centers, primarily because enterprise workloads and 
scaling requirements were different than those seen in HPC. But big changes are afoot in the commercial 
data center -- changes that are being driven by several factors, including multicore, the rise of cloud 
computing, and the emergence of new and important workloads in the enterprise. Because of these and 
other trends, we are entering a new period of IT convergence in which the enterprise and HPC will share 
an increasing number of concerns and pain points. How this convergence unfolds and how actively the 
HPC community participates in this convergence will have far-reaching consequences for the future 
health of both enterprise computing and HPC.
 Brief Biography:  
With over twenty years of experience in High Performance Computing, Josh currently leads an effort 
within VMware's Office of the CTO to bring the value of virtualization to HPC. Previously, he was a 
Distinguished Engineer at Sun Microsystems with broad responsibilities for HPC direction and strategy. 
He joined Sun in 1996 from Thinking Machines Corporation, a pioneering company in the area of 
Massively Parallel Processors (MPPs), where he held a variety of technical positions. Josh has worked on 
developer tools for distributed parallel computing, including language and compiler design, scalable 
parallel debugger design and development, and MPI. He has also worked in the areas of 3D graphics, 
image processing, and realtime device control. Josh has an undergraduate degree in Engineering from 
Harvard College and a Masters in Computer Science from Harvard University. He has served as a 
member of the OpenMP ARB Board of Directors since 2002 and is currently serving as Chairman of the 
Board.
