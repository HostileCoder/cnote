Abstract-In-home healthcare services based on the 
Internet-of-Things (loT) have big potential in business. To 
exploit this opportunity, an ecosystem should be 
established first. Technical solutions should aim for a 
cooperative ecosystem by addressing the interoperability, 
security, and system integration. In this paper, we propose 
an ecosystem-driven design strategy and apply it in the 
design of an open-platform based solution. In particular, a 
cooperative ecosystem is formulated by merging the 
traditional healthcare and mobile internet ecosystems. 
Utilizing the existing standardization efforts, the interfaces 
between actors can be simplified. To balance the control 
and avoid monopoly, ecosystem-driven security schemes 
are proposed including the public-based authentication, 
repository-based credential management, SE-based 
cryptography, and non-invasive message handover. In 
order to achieve the economy of scale, an open platform?
 based in-home healthcare station is proposed. The 
proposed methodology and solution are demonstrated in 
implemented prototype system and field trials.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The revolution of Internet-of-Things (loT) is reshaping the 
modern healthcare with promising economic and social 
prospects [1-3]. Powered by its ubiquitous identification, 
sensing, and communication capacities, all objects in the 
healthcare systems (people, equipment, medicine, etc.) can be 
tracked and/or monitored on a 2417 basis [4]. Enabled by its 
global connectivity, all the healthcare related information 
(logistics, diagnosis, therapy, recovery, medication, 
management, finance, and even daily activity) can be collected, 
managed, and shared efficiently. By using the personal 
computing devices (laptop, mobile phone, tablet, etc.) and 
mobile internet access (WiFi, 3G, LTE, etc.), the loT-based 
healthcare services can be mobile and personalized [5-7]. 
Large user base and maturated ecosystem of traditional mobile 
internet service have significantly sped up the development of 
the loT -powered in-home healthcare (lHH) services, so-called 
Health-loT. At the same time, the Health-loT extends the 
ISBN 978-89-968650-1-8 529 
traditional mobile internet services to a new application area. 
Especially after the open-source operation systems, such as 
Android [8], were introduced and broadly applied, the Health?
 loT has been expected to be one of the "killer" applications of 
loT. Therefore the development of Health-loT solution based 
on open platform has become a hot topic. 
In recent years, a number of single point devices and 
applications have been proposed. But as required by the 
economy of scale, a general architecture is needed to support 
various applications by a common loT platform. So, more 
comprehensive architecture study is needed. Moreover, this 
general architecture should be feasible not only from technical 
point-of-view but also from business point of view. 
Comparing to the traditional mobile internet ecosystem, the 
Health-loT ecosystem is much more complicated as more 
stakeholders are involved. To create sustainable Health-loT 
services, the establishment of a cooperative ecosystem is 
primarily important to the whole industry. Such ecosystem 
should deliver enough added values to all stakeholders instead 
of a part. High level architectures of all technical aspects such 
as security, interoperability, and enterprise information system 
(EIS) integration, should serve for this goal. Therefore, 
ecosystem-driven design strategy is necessary in the early 
stage of technical development. The exiting research on this 
topic is very rear. 
In this paper, we propose and demonstrate an ecosystem?
 driven design strategy for the Health-loT applications. In 
particular, a cooperative ecosystem of Health-loT is 
formulated first based on the analysis of the traditional 
healthcare and mobile internet ecosystems. As it is established 
upon shared infrastructures, the interoperability of devices 
from different suppliers is important. By reviewing existing 
standardization efforts on device interoperability, we propose a 
set of simplified interfaces among different actors within the 
ecosystem. 
Secondly, in order to achieve the economy of scale, an IHH 
Station (IHHS) is proposed as a universal platform for device 
and service integration and convergence. To protect the 
benefits of all stakeholders, value-centric security schemes are 
proposed, including the public authority-based authentication, 
January 27 - 30. 2013 ICACT2013 
the secure element (SE) based cryptography, and the non?
 invasive message handover. 
Thirdly, to verify the concepts and technical feasibilities, we 
have developed a prototype system called iMedBox. It is a 
specific case for medication management and in-home 
monitoring applications. The iMedBox hardware, software and 
backbone system are implemented and evaluated by field 
demonstrations. The positive feedbacks have proven the 
feasibility of proposed design methods, proposed architectures 
and solutions. Based on the results of this paper, economically 
feasible services are closer to reality. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The 
ecosystem analysis and technical interfaces are presented in 
section II. The security schemes are presented in section III. 
The IHHS architecture, implementation, and experimental 
results are introduced in section IV, and concluded in section 
V. 
II. To ESTABLISH A COOPERATIVE ECOSYSTEM 
A. Lessons from Google Health's failure 
Since Jan 1, 2012, as one of the most famous Health-loT 
business efforts, the Google Health service has been 
discontinued [9]. This has been looked as a big setback. It is 
difficult to assert the exact reason but we can learn some 
lessons by analyzing the possible reasons. According to the 
summary of possible reasons listed by Brian Dolan [10], seven 
of the ten reasons are related to the establishment of 
ecosystem: the Google Health was not trustworthy (lack of 
public authority), not fun or social, not involving doctors, not 
partnering with insurance companies, hard to overcome the 
current reimbursement barriers, lack of advertising 
opportunity, and not useful to consumers. 
This finding is consistent with the prediction of lTV when 
the vision of loT was introduced: "the Internet of Things will 
occur within a new ecosystem that will be driven by a number 
of key players" [11]. Before developing the technical solutions, 
it is more important clearly answer "how to establish a new 
cooperative ecosystem, and how to deliver enough added 
values to all of stakeholders in that ecosystem?" Hence, the 
ecosystem analysis is the first step of our work. 
B. Ecosystems of traditional healthcare and mobile internet 
As shown in Fig. 1 (a) and (b), the ecosystems of traditional 
healthcare service and traditional mobile internet service are 
formularized and compared. The main stakeholders involved 
in both of them can be classified into four roles: financial 
sources, means suppliers, service providers, and end users. The 
service providers are the actor of service execution and 
delivery. Means providers provide necessary materials, tools, 
supplies, etc. to the service providers but seldom face the end 
users directly. Products and services mainly flow from means 
providers, through service providers, to end users. Payments 
(obligatory or optional, depending on different cases) flow 
back from end users, through financial sources, to the means 
providers and service providers. Thus a close-loop value chain 
ISBN 978-89-968650-1-8 530 
is established. It is exactly the "close-loop" feature that makes 
the ecosystem economically sustainable. Win-win cooperation 
is enabled only if every stakeholder's benefit is guaranteed.

Fig. I , Business ecosystems of (a) traditional healthcare service, (b) traditional 
mobile internet service, and (c) loT-powered health care service 
In spite of the above mentioned similarity, we can see 
significant differences between the two ecosystems. Firstly, 
the healthcare service ecosystem has more complicated 
financial sources. Despite the diverse policies in different 
countries, the public authority and insurance company are the 
most important financial sources, and thus have the highest 
influence on the rules of healthcare services. Another 
important difference is related to privacy and security. The 
healthcare services deal with privacies of end users which are 
much more sensitive than that in the mobile internet services. 
As a result, in the traditional healthcare ecosystem, the privacy 
information flows within the service providers strictly limited 
by regulations that have been well established and accepted. 
These two major differences are the main concerns and drivers 
when we formulate the new Health-loT ecosystem. 
January 27 - 30, 2013 ICACT2013 
C. The proposed ecosystem 
As shown in Fig. I (c), the new loT-powered healthcare 
service ecosystem is proposed and formulated by merging the 
two traditional ecosystems. Obviously the Health-loT service 
is a business upon shared infrastructures including the internet 
backend facilities, core networks, access networks, and mobile 
terminals. 
In this ecosystem, the healthcare service providers (like 
hospitals, elderly houses, pharmaceutical enterprises etc.) and 
healthcare financial sources (like public authorities, insurance 
companies, etc.) have larger influence than other stakeholders. 
The content providers (like Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc.) 
and telecom operators (like China Mobile, Vodafone, Verizon, 
etc.) cannot rule the ecosystem anymore. Large mobile device 
providers (like Apple, Nokia, Samsung, etc.) and medical 
device providers (like Roche, Omron, Philips, Johnson, etc.) 
should cooperate more than before to ensure the 
interoperability of their products. Due to the application-store?
 based software distribution model, consumers and application 
developers get more fairness in the ecosystem. 
The cooperation between traditional healthcare service 
providers and internet content providers is the key to bring the 
ecosystem into reality. On one hand, the healthcare service 
providers don't need to establish new extra infrastructures 
(like data centers, servers, software and other backend 
systems) by their own. Instead, they should make use of the 
existing infrastructures owned by the internet content 
providers. In this case, the contents of healthcare services are 
delivered to the end users through the channels of telecom 
operators. On the other hand, the internet content providers, as 
well as telecom operators, should get the healthcare contents 
from healthcare service providers rather than "create" such 
contents by themselves. The healthcare financial sources 
should encourage and protect such cooperation by paying to 
the content providers directly or through healthcare service 
providers. 
Furthermore, the privacy regulations and public 
authentications should be applied to the content providers and 
telecom operators, as strictly as they are applied to the 
healthcare service providers. This is the primary precondition 
for the end users to agree on uploading and managing their 
privacy through these channels. Besides the legislative 
approaches, technical approaches should also be in place to 
make sure only the owner and specially authorized individuals 
can access the private information. These principles are the 
foundation of the proposed security schemes. 
Additionally, the advertisers should be authorized to provide 
specific advertisement services for both healthcare means 
providers and healthcare service providers. But this 
advertisement shouldn't invade any patient's privacy. It is 
important to be aware that advertisement is the most mature 
and trusted business model of the mobile internet ecosystem. 
Respect on such well-established business model is essential to 
initiate new businesses. 
ISBN 978-89-968650-1-8 531 
D. Standardization of the interfaces 
Given the formulation of the new Health-loT ecosystem, 
specific technical requirements can be derived more 
comprehensively and clearly. For example, the standardization 
of interfaces between any two actors within the ecosystem are 
necessary to ensure interoperability. The standardization of 
Health-loT technologies should be ecosystem-driven instead 
of technology-driven. 
As shown in Fig. 2, three types of interfaces should be 
standardized. Firstly, the hardware and software interfaces 
between healthcare means suppliers and mobile application 
designers, and between means suppliers and mobile platform 
providers. For these interfaces, the Continua Health Alliance 
(CHA), a major standardization body working on device level 
interoperability, has recommended the Bluetooth Health 
Device Profiles (HDP), USB Personal Healthcare Device 
Profile and ZigBee Health Care Profile. They all apply a 
common data format specified by the ISO/IEEE 11073 family. 
Based on these standards, the mobile platform providers and 
application designers can make a common driver for the same 
class of medical devices from different manufacturers. And 
then, the mobile devices can recognize a particular medical 
device according to its hardware descriptor and automatically 
apply correct data parsing and communication protocols. Thus, 
the complexity of patients' operation, hardware and software 
costs, and hence time to market, can be significantly reduced.

Fig.2. Technical interfaces between actors (a) without standardization, and (b) 
with standardized hardware interfaces, data formats, and security schemes 
Secondly, the format of electronic health record (EHR) 
should be standardized. The HL 7, EN 13606 (specified by 
European Committee for Standardization), and ISO 18308 are 
the major efforts for this purpose. These EHR standards define 
I) the protocol to exchange EHR messages; 2) the contents 
and structures EHR data, and 3) the mechanisms to ensure 
privacy and security of information sharing. By applying the 
EHR standards, the technical negotiations between healthcare 
service providers and mobile platform providers are simplified 
or hopefully avoided. The negotiation between healthcare 
service providers and application designers are simplified too. 
Thirdly, security schemes throughout the entire ecosystem 
should be standardized. Otherwise, all the parties would 
certainly intend to specify their own security mechanisms to 
January 27 - 30, 2013 ICACT2013 
PaSecret 
Fig.3. The proposed security schemes 
protect their information as well as business benefits. 
However, the existing standardization efforts have not 
provided a solution so far. In our solution, to be trusted by the 
whole ecosystem, the traditional application store should be 
accredited by public authorities, and then it is transformed into 
a service repository. All security credentials are recorded by 
the repository and supervised by the public authority. 
It is necessary to mention that the service logic should be 
left proprietary instead of standardized to encourage 
differential competition. The healthcare service providers can 
customize proprietary apps from application designers to 
accomplish specific value-added services. This point is 
supplementary to the efforts of IHE which promotes the 
coordinated use of established standards such as HL7 to 
address specific clinical need in support of optimal patient 
care. 
III. ECOSYSTEM-DRIVEN SECURITY MECHANISM DESIGN 
A healthy ecosystem should protect the benefits of all 
stakeholders by balancing the control and avoiding monopoly. 
In the Health-loT ecosystem, security mechanisms are the 
primary technical means to do so (of course, there are many 
non-technical measures that should be applied, but they are out 
of the scope of this paper). As the patients never believe the 
content providers and telecom operators can really protect 
their privacy [10], the only solution is to accredit an 
independent mediator, here the service repository, by the 
public authority. Principally, only the owner of the private 
information (the patient and hislher healthcare service 
provider) can access the information.

Based on the above considerations, the security schemes are 
proposed in Fig. 3. The public authority, service repository, 
healthcare service provider, content provider, telecom 
operator, and patient are the main actors in these security 
schemes. 
A. Public-based authentication 
As illustrated by the stepl-14 in Fig. 3, to launch a 
particular Health-loT service to the market, the enterprises 
should get authentication from the public authority first. The 
authentication is granted in the form of credential, so-called 
Secrete, which is a set of cryptography software running in the 
trusted hardware. The Secrete of each actor should be handed 
over by superior and safe approach. For example, it can be 
registered and delivered in person and delivered by accredited 
couriers. Only a certain person of a certain service provider 
can access a certain patient's information. That is, the 
authentication is tied to individuals instead of organizations. 
B. Repository-based credential management 
The service repository maintains all the Secretes of actors in 
trusted facilities. The content provider and telecom operator 
only maintain their own Secrets, which ensures the non?
 invasive message handover in-between patient and healthcare 
provider. The service provider maintains its own Secrete 
locally and can request other actors' keys from service 
repository. 
C. SE-based cryptography 
The secure element (SE) is a secured device that can store 
and execute specific cryptography algorithm. The algorithm is 
written by issuer and is extremely difficult to hack. A typical 
SE is the SIM (subscriber identification module) card that is 
January 27 - 30, 2013 ICACT2013 
commonly used in mobile telecom services [12]. When a 
message is sent from the sender, it is encrypted and a signature 
is attached. Both the encryption key and signature are 
generated dynamically by the sender's SE. When the receiver 
receives the message, it sends the signature to its own SE. If 
the receiver has been authorized, there should be a copy 
(symmetric or asymmetric) of the sender's Secret in the 
receiver's SE, so that the receiver's SE can derive the 
decryption key. Only if everything (the signature, encryption 
key, decryption key, and Secrets in the SEs of both-sides) 
matches, the message can be decrypted. Furthermore, the 
Secrets in the SE are readable and writable only by the issuer 
(here the public authority). So, although the patient's SE 
contains the Secrets of other actors, the Secrets are not 
disclosed. And the communication between apps and SE is 
local within professional equipment (e.g. the Health-loT 
Station). This reduces the security risk further. 
If the SIM card is used as the SE, the logistics of SIM-card 
management will be significantly different with that in 
traditional telecom services. Traditionally, the SIM card is 
fully issued and supervised by the telecom operator. But in 
Health-loT services, the SIM card should be issued and 
supervised by the public authority, and the telecom operator 
can only manage a part of the SIM as predefined by the public 
authority. This change may cause resistance by telecom 
operators. It should be resolved mainly by non-technical 
means, such as policy enforcement and financial 
compensation. And the telecom industry has also prepared 
technical solutions such as the remote subscription and SIM 
supervision [l3]. 
D. Non-invasive message handover 
The information from patient to service provider and 
response from service provider to patient are illustrated in the 
step 51-60 and step 61-64 respectively. As the content 
provider and telecom operator only maintain their own 
Secrets, they have no access to the messages transmitted 
through their facilities. In other words, the Health-loT streams 
are transparent to them. This mechanism is called non-invasive 
message handover which is essential to get trusted from the 
end users and financial sources. 
IV. ECOSYSTEM-DRIVEN TERMINAL DESIGN 
A. The IHH Station as the common terminal platform 
As a typical shared infrastructure, the IHHS is not a close 
system. Instead, it should be open to other applications like 
telecommunication and entertainment, so that the content 
suppliers and telecom operators can deliver other value-added 
services through it. Solid security is ensured by the secure 
element which could be the SIM card, the NFC (near field 
communication) card, or an embedded secure device. 
The proposed IHHS solution is based on open source 
operation systems like the Google Android. It uses standard 
mobile internet terminal hardware, such as tablet PC, provided 
by various 3C (consumer, communication and computing) 
ISBN 978-89-968650-1-8 533 
manufactures. By installing specific apps, the 3C terminal can 
transform into many variants, from the logbook, to fatal 
monitor, wheel chain controller, portable monitor, smart 
walker, and medicine box (Fig.S). It is suitable for mass 
production with low cost as it is a "standard" product. It is 
also broadly acceptable by the whole ecosystem as it is based 
on an "open" platform. 
Fig.4. Hardware variants of the Health-loT Station based on open platform 
B. The Concept of the iMedBox 
To verify the concepts and design strategy proposed in this 
paper, a prototype system has been implemented and evaluated 
in field trials. As a typical case of the IHHS, application 
scenario of an iMedBox system has been proposed in our 
previous work [14]. A powerful intelligent medicine box 
(iMedBox) works not only as in-home medicine container, but 
also as a "medication inspector", and an "onsite examiner" in 
daily healthcare monitoring. It connects to the healthcare 
service providers through 3G and WiFi networks and 
communicates to medical devices through USB, NFC, RFID, 
and WSN (wireless sensor network). Medication and fatal 
information is transmitted to the backbone systems and 
feedback from service providers is presented to the patient at 
home. The iMedBox is equipped with touch screen and 
powerful processors to provide friendly user interface and best 
operation fluency. 
C. Implementation of the IHHS prototype 
The prototype is based on the Sam sung Galaxy Tab I 0.1 
tablet PC. It has a 10.1 inch display with touch screen, a dual?
 core 1GHz ARM Cortex-A9 CPU, and connections through 
USB OTG, WiFi and 3G. The operation system is Android 3.1. 
As shown in Fig. 4, we extended the hardware through a USB 
adaptor to support NFC and WSN connections which are not 
standard peripherals of tablet PC so far. A functional iMedBox 
is assembled by embedding the tablet and extension modules 
into a hand-molding box. As a part of the demonstration, 
intelligent medicine packages are made by attaching inlay 
RFID tags onto ordinary medicine packages. 
The application software for the demonstration is 
implemented in Java as standard Android apps. The graphic 
engine is the AChartEngine, and database engine is the SQLite. 
A dedicated data processing engine for data packet parsing, a 
security engine for authentication and cryptograph, and a web 
server for 3G/WiFi connection are implemented based on the 
January 27 - 30. 2013 ICACT2013 
basic Android 2.1 API which is supported by major variants of 
Android. Two types of QUI are designed so far: a Sensor 
View for sensor data and a Medication View for

D. Users' feedback and improvement directions 
. . . 
-
 Some field trials have been carried out in nursing centers 
and elderly houses in Blekinge, Sweden. The system concepts 
have been confirmed by the positive feedback. The medication 
reminding and recording functions can significantly improve 
the medication compliance especially for elderly. Seamless 
integration to the hospital's prescription system is necessary to 
reduce the workload of manual input. The proposed 
authentication scheme sounds complicated but necessary to 
reassure the users. 
Some insufficiencies are also pointed out. The user 
interfaces are still too complicated for elderlies although they 
are acceptable for nurses. The texts are not clear enough. This 
can be improved by replacing the Android's default colors and 
fonts which is quite "fashion" but lack of clarity. The network 
connection and authentication are too slow (currently around 
10 seconds). We will further measure the latency step-by-step 
to find out the bottleneck and improve. 
V. CONCLUSION AND FuTURE WORK 
To develop successful Health-loT solutions towards the loT, 
a cooperative ecosystem should be established first. Technical 
architectures should be centered to the ecosystem especially 
regarding the interoperability, security and information system 
ISBN 978-89-968650-1-8 534 
integration. In this paper, a cooperative ecosystem of Health?
 loT is formulated based on the analysis of the traditional 
healthcare and mobile internet ecosystems. Then we apply the 
ecosystem-driven strategy in the design of security 
mechanisms and terminal platform. To balance control ability 
and avoid monopoly, ecosystem-driven security schemes are 
proposed including the public-based authentication, 
repository-based credential management SE-based 
cryptography, and non-invasive message handover. In order to 
achieve the economy of scale, an Android-based in-home 
healthcare station is proposed to be the convergence terminal 
platform. To verify the concepts, we implemented an iMedBox 
prototype as a specific application case. The positive feedback 
from field trials has proven the effectiveness of proposed 
methodology and solutions. Improvement directions are also 
pointed out such as speed of authentication, fluency of 
operations, and clarity of graphical user interfaces. 
One important future work is to implement the proposed 
security mechanisms by involving more external partners 
including the SIM card maker and telecom operator. Then we 
plan to integrate the iMedBox terminal into some existing 
healthcare information systems and carry out more trials.
