can produce 25Hz phase sensitive track circuit signal by 
theoretical analysis, simulation and implementation to solve big 
volume, noisy and poor precision of the inverter. It theoretically 
proves that the CORDIC algorithm simulation based on Matlab

wave signals outputting from the experiment which phases differ 
by 90 degrees. It provides the improvement of CORDIC 
algorithm by analyzing and comparing the arithmetic speeds of 
floating-point number and fixed-point number. Combining 
theoretical analysis and calculation, it shows that the improved 
CORDIC algorithm can achieve the maximum frequency of 
output signal. Experimental waveforms and experimental data 
show that the voltage of 25Hz phase sensitive track circuit based 
on the CORDIC algorithm has the ability of driving binary two

I. INTRODUCTION 
At present, most of the electrified sections of our country 
usually use 25Hz phase sensitive track circuit to detect 
occupancy of train. The core equipment of 25Hz phase 
sensitive track circuit is binary two relay, the working principle 
of which is to add two lines of 110V25Hz and 25V25Hz 
alternating current (AC) in its local coil and rail coil, making 
sure the local voltage phase angle ahead of the rail’s voltage 
phase angle 90°[1].  
With development of China's railway in the direction of 
high speed and overloaded, it puts forward a higher request to 
railway transport equipment. Now, most 25Hz power supply 
have adopted the 220V mains frequency. Frequency inverter 
has disadvantages of big bulk, noisy, poor accuracy, and its 
parameters fixed immutable. Meanwhile, these inverters adopt 
manual operation, time of which is long. When the failure 
occurs, it cannot be transferred to second power supply panel 
and make the power supply abnormal [2]. These shortcomings 
have brought great inconvenience to the research and the 
development of signal microcomputer monitoring equipment 
calibration [3]. Therefore, this paper, combined with Cortex-M3 
core-based ARM processor STM32F103RET6, designs a set of 
signal generator equipment to solve these problems. 
CORDIC, called the Coordinate Rotation Digital Computer, 
is a kind of algorithm used to calculate trigonometric functions.
 Its basic idea is to use the vector rotation method to the 
trigonometric functions with iterative calculation, saving the 
storage space of data table, greatly improving the utilization of 
the ROM. In the process of iterative calculation only involves 
addition and shift calculation. This method is not only high 
precision and large throughput, but also has the advantages of 
flexible and variable system[4].  
Using this algorithm to output sine signal can solve existing 
shortcomings of frequency inverter. 
II. SUMMARY OF CORDIC ALGORITHM
 The core idea of the CORDIC is vector rotation. First of all, 
it assumes that a vector R ? ?, Ti iX Y  in the rectangular 
coordinate system, which angle is i? . When the angle of vector 
R changes ?? .There is

To make the rotating angle of tangent value only for integer 
power of 2, that is tan 2 j? ?? ? .Therefore, the tangent 
algorithm of formula (1) can be converted to the shift 
operations. Plug tan 2 j? ?? ? into the formula (1) can 
receive an iterative matrix.

Among them, 1k? ?  represents the direction of rotation, 
counterclockwise rotation vector is 1k? ?  and clockwise 
rotation vector is  1k? ?  . arctan 2 k?  is the angle for each 
iteration step value. This value is known, so in the algorithm, 
it can be stored as a constant in ROM. kZ is the rest angle. 
When 0kZ ? , the iteration process ends.

a specific initial value, using the CORDIC algorithm for 
multiple iterations, the functions sine/cosine can be calculated 
directly?[5] [6].

to transform trigonometric function symmetrically in the four

and in this way the algorithm can be covered in the entire cycle.

Comparing figure 2 and figure 3 can be found that the 
COR-DIC algorithm before improved only calculates the sine 
value within 99.88 99.88?? ? ? , beyond the scope of 
calculation is no longer correct. But the improved algorithm 
can correctly calculate the sine value within the scope, the 
same as the actual calculation. For this reason, the use of 
sinusoidal signal generated CORDIC algorithm is theoretically 
feasible. 
IV. IMPLEMENT OF 25HZ PHASE SENSITIVE TRACK CIRCUIT 
SIGNAL BASED ON CORDIC ALGORITHM 
STM32 series (maximum working frequency is 72MHz), is 
the requirement which is specifically designed for ARM 
Cortex-M3 core, which has the characters of high-performance, 
low-cost, low-power embedded applications. It has the highest 
performance among similar products. This paper chooses 
STM32F103RET6 chip which has two built-in DAC modules. 
With the design of embedded test system based on the chip, it 
produces two 25Hz sinusoidal signal whose phases differed by 
90 degree. 
Combined with the simulation of CORDIC algorithm in 
Matlab, the basic flow diagram in C language environment has 
shown in figure 4.

In the practical application, using the timer to determine the 
signal frequency, while release the CPU processing resources. 
The cycle of 25Hz sinusoidal signal is 40ms, and one cycle has 
360 sampling points, so the interval of each sampling point 
is 40 / 360 1/ 9000ms s? . Adjusting the regular time to 
make sure the frequency of the output sine wave is 25Hz. 
When 360Phase ? , when at the end of the cycle, make 
0Phase ? , restart the next cycle. Meanwhile, variable 
“Phase” is the phase of angle, and make Phase value of second 
sine wave be 90 which can change the phase of two signals. 
Since the chosen chip has no floating-point arithmetic unit 
(FPU), when iterations is 5 times, 24Hz of signal has become 
limit. Through RIGOL DS1102D type waveform oscilloscope 
observation found that signal serrated obviously, as shown in 
figure 5. Therefore Floating-point CORDIC algorithm cannot 
produce 25Hz sine wave, and the ability of floating point 
calculation becomes the main contradiction. 
Although STM32F103RET6 floating point capability is 
limited, compared to fixed-point operation speed is much 
faster[8]. To increase the overall parameters of algorithm to 
610  times, make the parameter is 607300K ? , the initial 
value is 0x K? , 0 0y ? , 0 0z ? , 6*10nz Angle? . Deal 
the sine value with corresponding processing, and then assign it 
to the data registers of DAC, waveform as shown in figure 6.

Make two signals go through power amplifier respectively 
which can get alternating voltages of 25V25Hz and 110V25Hz. 
LM386 of National Semiconductor is chosen as the first level 
amplifier and LM3886 is chosen as second level power 
amplifier. 
 By computing, the maximum output power is 50W. 
Compared with the data of Table 1, the voltage can meet the 
parameters of JRJC1-70/240 binary two relay.

V. CONCLUSIONS  
Compared with two kinds of algorithm, the ARM chip 
which is chosen in this paper needs 19.11 s? to calculate a 
time of CORDIC floating-point iteration, while a fixed-point 
iteration calculation only need 1.18 s? . The floating-point 
iterative CORDIC algorithm is limited by 5 times and only 
single DAC can output, while the fixed-point CORDIC 
algorithm not only can iterate 20 times, but also can output 
double sine wave at the same time. In terms of the program 
capacity in same compo, HEX file of look-up table method is 9 
KB, HEX file of floating-point CORDIC algorithm is 13 KB 
and HEX file fixed-point CORDIC algorithm is 7 KB in Keil 
uVision4 compile environment. 
Analysis of the data shows that floating-point algorithm can 
be applied to non-FPU chip completely by transforming 
parameters, which performance is better than using floating-
 point algorithm. The data on the oscilloscope indicates that the 
system can be used as the signal source applied in the 
microcomputer monitoring system.
