Abstract— The rapid access of sensor technology provides 
both challenges and opportunities to authenticated 
spatiotemporal data. Authentication can be assured by 
developing related ontologies. Ontology explicitly specifies shared 
conceptualization and formal vocabularies. In this paper, we 
proposed an environmental spatio-temporal ontology (ESTO) 
using unified resource description framework (RDF) and 
Intelligent Environmental Knowledgebase (i-EKbase) 
recommendation system. Five different environmental data 
sources namely SILO, AWAP, ASRIS, CosmOz, and MODIS 
were considered to develop i-EKbase where knowledge was 
integrated. The recommendation system was founded on web 
based large scale dynamic data mining, contextual knowledge 
extraction, and integrated knowledge representation. The 
proposed ESTO was tested for optimization of the accessibility 
and usability issues related to big data sets and minimize the 
overall application costs. RDF representation made this ontology 
very flexible to publish on Linked Open Data Cloud 
environment. 
Keywords— Metadata, RDF, Linked Open Data, i-EKbase, Spatio-

I. INTRODUCTION 
A. Linked open data, cloud computing and semantics 
Rapid access of sensor technology creates necessity of 
geographic information integration and sharing across distinct 
systems and designs. This is an important area in current issue 
of research on metadata and semantic, which aims to enable 
Linked Open Data (LOD) that is used to provide a seamless 
view of all information on the web.  
Currently efforts to integrate geographic information 
embrace the idea of meta-data standards as the key to 
information sharing and analysis [8]. These include the 
initiatives of Federal Geographic Data committee (FGDC), 
National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI), GeoSpatial One-
 Stop and the US Geological Survey’s National Map as well as 
standards from the International Standards Organization (ISO) 
for geospatial metadata [9, 10, 11, 12]. The NSDI attempts to 
bring together geographical information sources from all levels 
of government and other organizations into a single point of 
entry for easier access to data. Furthermore, W3C geospatial 
ontology in 2007 provides vocabulary tags for modelling the 
geographic data in Ontology Web Language format (OWL).  
However, Geographic information-processing today faces 
two main problems, namely; barriers to information integration 
caused by incompatible terminology and a lack of 
interoperability among the available software [1, 6, 22]. 
Furthermore, the current efforts lack consideration of large 
volume of environmental metadata and knowledge to build the 
knowledgebase on the web of data. In terms of completeness, 
geospatial ontology has not been updated and it does not cover 
the information of users and origin of the data. Different 
sources of environmental sensor or model based data could be 
used to complement and cross validate each other 
automatically. This shows that there is a need for on demand 
complementary knowledge integration from multiple data 
sources and automatic interpretation of the knowledge [2, 21]. 
B. Necessity of developing Environmental Spatio- Temporal 
ontology 
In this study due to the necessity of environmental data 
modelling, “Environmental Spatio-Temporal Ontology 
(ESTO)” was developed based on metadata integration for 
providing the one-stop service for building the application on 
the web. In this ontology, metadata from SILO [13], the 
Australian Water Availability Project (AWAP) [14], the 
Australian Soil Resource Information System (ASRIS) [15], 
the Australian Cosmic Ray Sensor Network (CosmOz) [16] 
and MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer 
(MODIS) [17] were included. This ontology is based on 
resource description framework (RDF) that is given the 
feasibility to access information using the uniform resource 
identifier (URI), which is also programmatically machine 
readable [18].  
This paper is structured as follows. We start by providing 
the current efforts and initiatives in GIS for metadata standard. 
We discuss the relevance of metadata ontology in 
environmental data accessibility instances and a need to 
develop a machine readable ESTO. The opportunities and 
challenges of developing ESTO and publishing on LOD are 
raised in science problem section. We present the concept of

ESTO and its backbone, the integrated Environmental 
Knowledge base (i-EKbase) including the storage of metadata 
and publishing on LOD. In section 5, we present the 
application of ESTO for associated data issues, for example, 
sensor data quality assurance, data usage optimization and 
context capturing from the users. The applications of ESTO 
provide promising results and we conclude that the ESTO is a 
novel approach and can be extended in the specification and 
characterization of broad environmental metadata.  
II. SCIENCE PROBLEM 
The underlying research challenge of this study was to 
extract the metadata from different sources and convert them 
into unified machine readable format, develop the ESTO in an 
integrated way and test its robustness. Fundamental issue 
behind this work was to design and develop a complex spatio-
 temporal ontology by processing multiple environmental data 
sources simultaneously. This ontology capture features, unify 
and build integrated knowledgebase in a meaningful way 
which could be used for future applications [19]. For any given 
latitude longitude combination and time frame, five different 
data sources would be downloaded, all metadata would be pre-
 processed, and cross validated based on semantic technologies. 
Finally this ESTO would be published on LOD to make the 
ontology highly accessible to the spatiotemporal data 
engineering and end users.  
III. ENVIRONMENTAL META DATA 
Five different environmental data sources were considered 
for the development of i-EKbase, namely, SILO, AWAP, 
CosmOz, ASRIS, and MODIS (see Figure 1). Long Paddock 
SILO database is operated by the Queensland Climate Change 
Centre of Excellence (QCCCE) within the Department of 
Science, Information Technology, Innovation and the Arts 
(DSITIA). The AWAP database is developed to monitor the 
state and trend of the terrestrial water balance of the Australian 
continent, using model-data fusion methods to combine both 
measurements and modelling. The ASRIS database provides 
online access to the best publicly available information on soil 
and land resources in a consistent format across Australia. The 
CosmOz database is a near-real time soil moisture 
measurement network providing neutron counts related to bulk 
soil moisture. MODIS database which includes data from Terra 
MODIS and Aqua MODIS satellites - viewing the entire 
Earth's surface every 1 to 2 days, acquiring data in 36 spectral 
bands, or groups is available via NASA website. Individual 
web data adaptors were created to access, download and 
integrate metadata sets automatically based on semantic 
metadata matching mechanism to create the ontology [13, 17]. 
IV. DEVELOPMENT OF PROPOSED ESTO 
A. Concept of ESTO 
The concept of ESTO is to share the environmental 
attributes and complex knowledge on the web and to build 
other applications on the fly. Figure 1 shows the process of 
metadata extraction from different sources and then these 
metadata have been converted to RDF by using the wrapper 
functionality. The ESTO is composed of integration of RDF 
files. Later, we published all the information on the web 
through HTTP access protocol. 
Depending on the latitude and longitude of any given 
location, the nearest weather station from Bureau of 
Meteorology (BOM) was selected. The corresponding SILO 
metadata file (.txt format) was then downloaded and processed. 
CosmOz metadata (.csv format) was also downloaded for the 
selected BOM weather station. AWAP database was connected 
through a secured FTP server and grid files including metadata 
files (.NetCDF format) were downloaded locally. ASRIS 
database was downloaded from publicly available ASRIS 
website. For the same location a pixel position was derived on 
the daily continental AWAP gridded data and time series were 
extracted for individual variable for a given time frame. 
Similarly a pixel position was also calculated from ASRIS data 
to extract soil resource information for the same latitude and 
longitude (.shp ESRI shapefile format). MODIS images and 
metadata (.HDF format) were downloaded and processed [18, 
20].

B. Metadata Processing 
Metadata is “data about the data” and it provides the 
description of the what, where, who and how about the data. 
For example, a sensor node metadata could describe when and 
where the sensor node was deployed, who deployed that node, 
which environmental attributes are being measured, what are 
the features or characteristics of that particular sensory system, 
and finally the valid range of measurement that could be 
expected. However, metadata are generally used to describe the 
principal aspect of data with the aim of sharing, reusing, and 
understanding heterogeneous data sets. In fact, different types 
of sensor metadata may be considered, namely, static and 
dynamic sensor metadata and associated sensing information 
[5, 20]. 
Static sensor metadata consists of information such as 
location, type, sensor platform etc, whereas dynamic metadata 
could be description of a significant data event,  a data service 
disruption, or dynamic data quality annotation information. 
Without this metadata, many anomalies within the data sets are 
very hard to understand. If this metadata is available for 
comparison, it makes the data significantly easier to 
understand. The ultimate aim is to annotate the data with 
timely information about reliability, reusability and quality of 
1908
the data without having to search.  Figure 2 shows the metadata 
processing in general. Metadata processing engine takes input 
from the data source such as D1, D2…, D5 in diverse formats 
and produces the final output as RDF. It plays as a black box 
processor which includes the following four steps: 
Step 1:  Metadata extracted from D1 and select the standards 
vocabularies. In our case, SKOS, Geoname, SSN, Provenance 
vocabularies, etc were used. 
Step 2: A mapping file has been created based on the mentioned 
vocabularies. Selected attributes suitable for ESTO were used.  
Step 3: Extracted metadata has been mapped with the mapping 
properties by using the Jena API in Java programming.  The Jena is 
a semantic web framework used for reading and writing the RDF. 
Step 4: Finally we get RDFD1 and store the data into the triplestore. 
These steps were followed to convert all of the five different Meta 
data files to RDF format. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig.2: Concept of ESTO. 
C. TripleStore Storage 
A triplestore is a framework used for storing and querying 
RDF data. It provides a mechanism for persistent storage and 
access of RDF graphs [4]. Recently, there has been a major 
development initiative in query processing, access protocols 
and triple-store technologies. The proposed Ontology was 
developed using a triple called “Sesame triplestore”. Sesame is 
an open source framework for storage inference and querying 
of RDF data. Sesame matches the features of Jena with the 
availability of a connection API, inference support for 
multiple back-ends like MySQL and Postgres. Integrated 
knowledge RDF files were uploaded into the triplestore which 
provided all facilities of browsing, querying, exporting data in 
different formats. 
D. ESTO 
One of the major problems of spatiotemporal data is 
integration and sharing because of different semantics used in 
different data sources. To overcome this situation, it was 
required to integrate data that could be used for further 
applications. Figure 3 shows the process of RDF integration in 
ESTO. To achieve this goal, at first, we read the RDF files 
from a triple store for each observation, where data are stored 
in triple format. For instance, we considered temperature for  
each sources for a specific location. We read a concept related 
to the daily local temperature from RDFD1 files and we found 
the string unit value Celsius and then we read the RDFD2 and 
we found the string unit value Fahrenheit. The semantic 
matcher based on string matching algorithm and dictionaries  
 
 
 
 
 
compared two strings. If they did not match, the wordNet was  
 
 
 
consulted to find the synonym of the particular string and  
found that these two strings were referred to the unit of 
temperature.  
However, we also considered the skos: definition. In the 
integrated RDF output file, we kept the two data in our 
integrated RDF file with skos: notes which automatically 
included a conversion equation to harmonize all the 
temperature related data sources. 
Environmental attributes were semantically matched to 
form several subgroups, i.e. {SILO Max Temperature (degC), 
SILO Min Temperature (degC), AWAP Max Temperature 
(degC), AWAP MinTemperature (degC), and MODIS/Terra 
Land Surface Temperature (degC)}. 
Optimized attempts were made to keep all the properties 
and stored into the triplestore so that it can be extended in the 
future [13, 17].

E. ESTO for CLOUD Computing 
On the semantic web, URIs identify not just web documents, 
but also real-world objects like people, and cars and even 
abstract ideas and non-existing things like a mythical unicorn.  
A single URI presents RDF data and human readable HTML 
pages. Intuitively, it looks like web pages but it contains the 
data which can be down-loaded through the HTTP access. 
 
 
1909
ESTO on the web presented the metadata information 
“hasMaxTSILO” with the URI  
“http://csiro.au/metadata/hasMaxTSILO”.  
Similarly other metadata were presented by navigating the 
URIs. This web metadata can be used for modeling or 
publishing the environmental data on the data cloud and further 
cloud computing purposes.  The Pubby - a Linked Data 
publishing tool from the SPARQL endpoint was used to 
publish ESTO on the web to make it accessible for 
computational applications. This Spatiotemporal Ontology 
could be downloaded dynamically as turtle or in RDF format. 
Figure 4(a) shows the RDF representation of the ESTO, 
whereas 4(b) shows the interface representation of ESTO on 
the web.

 The web of data is increasing rapidly and the cloud 
diagram has doubled comparing to the previous model. It has 
been expanded in different domains such as medical, life 
science, agriculture, geoname etc. Nevertheless, it is important 
to consider the geoname at the primary stage to hook up the 
dataset in sensor domain [18]. 
F. ESTO On LOD with  Live Environmental Data 
RDF representation made this Ontology very flexible to 
publish on Linked Open Data cloud. The main purpose of the 
LOD was to make people connected through data on the web 
where people can share, reuse the knowledge very easily. The 
term Linked Open Data was introduced by Tim Berners-Lee in 
his Linked Open data note [3,7]. The URIs were primary key 
like relational database and by using these URIs, it was 
possible to identify the object or concept. RDF is general-
 purposes language for data representation on the web. The 
basic principle of Linked Open Data is described in the 
following ways: 
- Use URIs as names for resource. 
- Use HTTP URIs so that people can look up those 
names. 
- When someone looks up a URI, provide useful 
information, using the standards (RDF, SPARQL). 
- Interlinks to other URIs, such that they can generate 
more dynamic knowledge. 
 
In i-EKbase every piece of metadata was decomposed into 
triples (subject, object and predicate) and assigned with a 
unique URI for each resource or object. These resources or 
objects are connected with other resources from different data 
sources. 
Fig. 5 shows a sensor cloud node located at Benlomond, 
Tasmania which has an “exact match” from the geonames 
data sources. Nevertheless, it is important to consider the 
geoname at the primary stage to hook up the environmental 
datasets into the sensor domain in the cloud[18]. In our 
experiment, we ran a java script to automatically pullout 
mapping links from geonames data source and populate the 
required sub sets of Metadata. 21 exact matches were found 
based on sensor node locations. All these information were 
integrated into the LOD version of the i-Ekbase for CLOUD 
computing applications [23, 24, 25, 26, 27].  
V. APPLICATION OF ESTO 
A. Sensor Cloud Computing 
       One of the applications of ESTO is a plug and play role 
on the cloud computing for offering vast computing resources 
and providing complete visibility and transparency to these 
resources. Environmental sensor data such as temperature, 
rainfall etc. can be represented using ETSO’s metadata. 
Furthermore, it can play as a hub of sensor knowledge where 
one can see the metadata definition on the run-time by using a 
URI on the web, which can also be adapted to build their 
applications. 
B. Sensor Data Quality Assurance 
One of the applications of ESTO is sensor data quality 
assurance using Linked data approach. The ESTO can be used 
as background knowledge for ontology matching.  ESTO could 
be used to identify errors within the spatiotemporal data 
sources, annotate the quality of the sensor observations and for 
trust calculation. The important aspect of ESTO is that it could 
be used for multiple source data quality assurance as this 
Ontology captures five different environmental metadata 
sources. Furthermore, ESTO is also includes the origin of the 
data. This Ontology could also be used to filter invalid data. 
 
 
1910
C. Complementary Context Capturing 
Context is “that” which surrounds and gives meaning to 
something else. It describes the situation and the environment.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On the basis of contextual requirement of an environmental 
attribute which would be used in an application, 
complementary data could be extracted by using ESTO. While 
daily rainfall data from SILO is not available for a specific 
location and time period, rain data could still be made 
available from AWAP or MODIS resource products as 
complementing metadata is available in ESTO. It can be 
captured through the ESTO ontology by minimizing the 
information.  
D. Big Data Usage Optimization 
Accessing big data for knowledge engineering is a serious 
problem and there is a need to optimize the usage of data to 
reduce the computational costs. ESTO represents an Ontology 
which includes massive amount of metadata about 
significantly large variety of observation data from 
environmental sensory sources. Environmental and 
agricultural application could be designed using ESTO as a  
recommendation. Ontology could guide the designers the 
potential data attributes and their practical limitations or 
advantages even before the big data would be accessed. 
Ontology based information could help to minimize the cost 
function of a particular application. 
VI. CONCLUSION 
The main achievement of this paper is to develop the 
ESTO from the different data sources. Furthermore, we have  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
also shown the ESTO in Linked Open Data format for 
different applications. Despite this, we are aware of central 
problem within the context of Linked Open Data to identify 
correspondences between instances from different sources. As  
future work, we plan to develop more sophisticated ontologies 
aimed at obtaining 100% precision by minimizing human 
effort.
