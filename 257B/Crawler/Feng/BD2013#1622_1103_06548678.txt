 Cross-Platform Aviation Analytics 
Using Big-Data Integration Methods
 2013 Integrated Communications Navigation  
and Surveillance (ICNS) Conference 
April 25, 2013
The Analysis Challenge
 T H E  A N A L Y S I S  C H A L L E N G E
 Scale and complexity of aviation data limits research applications
 Obtaining radar and airport data, schedules, 
weather maps and forecasts, fleet information
 • Real-time transmission of very large data
 • Proprietary and inconsistent formats
 • No conditioning or validation
 Problems Acquiring Data
 Problems Analyzing Information
 Using data for strategic planning and recovery,
 cost improvement and new market opportunities
 • Goes beyond desktop capability
 • Time-consuming manual slicing of data
 • Need weather and competitor information 
to answer key operational questions
 Fuel and Oil
 Conservation
 Gate and 
Terminal Use
 Weather Plan & 
Ops Recovery
 Pilot and 
Crew Staffing
 Operational 
Optimization
 Big-data analytical methods can address these challenges
• Figurative “Cloud” 
The term comes from 
the common use of a 
cloud-shaped symbol as 
an abstraction for the 
Internet but application 
to virtual servers is as 
recent as 2006
 • Cloud computing is 
the use of resources 
(hardware and software) 
that are delivered as a 
service over the Internet 
or other network
 What is Cloud Computing?
 C L O U D  C O M P U T I N G
 The cloud consists of terrestrial servers across the Internet that 
collectively store, manage and process data

 What are Cloud Architectures?
 C L O U D  C O M P U T I N G
 In aviation cloud resources can be customized and shared among 
consortiums of customers (community cloud) or 
shared with customers in other industries (public cloud)
  
What is Big-Data Analytics?
 • The process of examining diverse, large-scale data sets to uncover 
patterns, unknown correlations and other useful information
 • Organizations have different levels of (1) database management 
expertise and (2) knowledge to process and analyze big data sets
 – “Big data” is a relative term based on the user
 – Data tables in excess of ten terabytes (10TB) are difficult to work with 
using most relational database management systems, and particularly 
using desktop statistics and visualization packages, including Microsoft 
Excel and Access 
• Unstructured data sources in the operational world simply do not fit 
into desktop or small-scale database structures 
– They can be hosted using cloud computing at lower cost, and mined 
more efficiently, than with on-premises database architectures
 B I G - D A T A  A N A L Y T I C S
What are Big-Data Analytics Tools?
 • Big-data analytics employ software tools from advanced analytics 
disciplines such as data mining and predictive analytics. 
– Mining data, trends or analysis of these multi-terabyte data sets requires 
parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of 
servers to keep pace with user demands and processing expectations. 
• A new class of big-data methods have emerged to address user demands 
for horizontal scaling and availability of underlying data  
– Hadoop and MapReduce, among others, offer fast processing speed. 
– Great for large-scale static data sets, but not so great for real-time data
 – Most organizations employ a hybrid method combining technologies
 • A robust open source framework supports processing in clustered systems.  
• Platform-as-a-service vendors (Microsoft, Amazon, Google) offer turn-key 
solutions for analysts to simply upload, link and compute basic data sets
 – Great for simple historical analysis; bad for real-time or diverse data sets

Example 1: Proposed FAA Tower Closures
 masFlight used big-data to link airport operations across three large data sets:
 – Current and historical airline schedules
 – Raw Aircraft Situation Display to Industry (ASDI) radar data from the FAA
 – Enhanced Traffic Management System Counts (ETMS), including Airport 
operations counts by type (commercial, freight, etc.), departure & arrival
 T O W E R  C L O S I N G S
 Dots indicate closures; Red dots have scheduled service
 Based on scheduled service March 1 – 7, 2013; scheduled service includes scheduled 
charter flights, cargo flights, and passenger flights
 Findings: Proposed Tower Closings
 • From schedules database: 55 airports with 
scheduled passenger airline service
 – 14 EAS Airports
 • From ASDI & ETMS: 10,600 weekly flights 
on a flight plan (ex. VFR and local traffic)
 – 6,500 Part 91/125 weekly flights
 – 4,100 Part 135/121 weekly flights

Example 2: Aviation Safety Causal Factor
 For example, consider the following ASRS report (ACN 1031837): 
“Departing IAH in a 737-800 at about 17,000 FT, 11 miles behind a 737-900 on the Junction departure over 
CUZZZ Intersection. Smooth air with wind on the nose bearing 275 degrees at 18 KTS. 
We were suddenly in moderate chop which lasted 4 or 5 seconds then stopped and then resumed for 
another 4 or 5 seconds with a significant amount of right rolling… I selected a max rate climb mode in the 
FMC in order to climb above the wake and flight path of the leading -900. We asked ATC for the type ahead 
of us and reported the wake encounter. The -900 was about 3,300 FT higher than we were.”
 • Synopsis 
– B737-800 First Officer reported wake encounter from preceding B737-900
 with resultant roll and moderate chop. 
What causal factors can be identified from this narrative that
 could be applied to future predictive applications?
 C A U S A L  F A C T O R S
 Data-mining algorithms can mine the text of safety reports 
to obtain specific data that can be used to analyze causal factors.  
Example 2: Identifying Causal Factors
 C A U S A L  F A C T O R S
 Indicators – Data Element Methods – Identifying Context and Causes
 • Time of day
 • Date range (month, day)
 • Aircraft type
 • Fix or coordinates
 • Originating airport
 • Destination airport
 • Weather notes
 We pinpoint the sequencing of flights on the IAH Junction 
Seven departure (at CUZZZ) during the specified wind 
conditions to find cases where a B737-900 at 20,000 feet 
precedes by 11 miles a B737-800 at 17,000 feet
 • Search related data sets including ASDI
 (flight tracks, local traffic and congestion)
 • Weather conditions for alternative causes (winds aloft, 
shear and convective activity)
 • Airline specific information (repeated occurrence of event 
in aircraft type)
 Big data gives us visibility into contextual factors even if specific 
data points are missing such as a specific date or route.  
Big-data analytics gives us insight into unreported factors as well.

Conclusions for Big Data in Aviation
 • Big-data transforms operational and commercial problems that were 
practically unsolvable using discrete data and on-premises hardware 
• Big data offers new insight into existing data by centralizing data 
acquisition and consolidation in the cloud and mining data sets efficiently 
• There is a rich portfolio of information that can feed aviation data analytics 
– Flight position, schedules, airport/gate, weather and government data sets 
offer incredible insight into the underlying causes of aviation inefficiency. 
– Excessive size of each set forces analysts to consider cloud based 
architectures to store, link and mine the underlying information 
– When structured, validated and linked, these data sources become 
significantly more compelling for applied research than they are individually
 • Today’s cloud based technologies offer a solution  
C O N C L U S I O N S
Conclusions:  Our Approach
 • masFlight’s data warehouse and analysis methods provide a 
valuable example for others attempting to solve cloud based 
analytics of aviation data sets 
• masFlight’s hybrid architecture, consolidating secure data feeds in 
on-premises server installations and feeding structured data into the 
cloud for distribution, addresses the unique format, security and 
scale requirements of the industry 
• masFlight’s method is well suited for airline performance review, 
competitive benchmarking, airport operations and schedule design, 
and has demonstrated value in addressing real-world problems in 
airline and airport operations as well as government applications
