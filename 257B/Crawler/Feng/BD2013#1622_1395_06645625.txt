 Numerical simulation based on computational fluid dy-
 namics (CFD) is now an indispensable technique especially
 in industry due to its acquisition capability of various data at
 a lower cost than experiments using a wind tunnel. The lat-
 tice Boltzmann method (LBM) is one of the CFD schemes,
 which is used to compute various problems including multi-
 phase flow. LBM has good parallelism, but simultaneously
 requires many data to compute each lattice point, result-
 ing in a low operational intensity. Consequently, the sus-
 tained performance of LBM is limited by memory band-
 width rather than arithmetic performance when computed
 by using general-purpose processors and GPUs. To make
 matters worse, insufficient bandwidth and high-latency of an
 interconnection network cause a relatively big overhead in
 parallel computing, especially in the case of strong-scaling.
 For scalable computation, acceleration with custom com-
 puting is a promising approach. Hardware designs dedicated
 to an individual application allow the system to efficiently
 utilize computing resources, being balanced with memory
 and network bandwidth. Moreover, cutting-edge semicon-
 ductor technology allows FPGAs to be capable of outper-
 forming microprocessors, even for floating-point operations,
 with a lot of logic elements, DSP blocks and blockmemories
 integrated with high-speed interfaces. Nowadays state-of-
 the-art FPGAs have a potential to bring high-performance
 and high-bandwidth to low-power custom computing.
 Such circumstances motivate FPGA-based custom com-
 puting for scientific applications. In our research project,
 we have developed a tightly-coupled FPGA cluster where
 FPGA-based accelerators are directly connected by an ac-
 celerator domain network (ADN) to achieve scalable com-
 putation with high-bandwidth and low-latency data commu-
 nication among accelerators. For LBM computation to ef-
 ficiently utilize both ADN and the computing resources on
 FPGAs, so far, we have also proposed and prototyped a par-
 allel custom computing architecture for an LBM accelera-
 tor, which is shown in Fig.1. As reported in [1], all the
 computation including non-regular computation for bound-
 ary conditions is performed by FPGAs to avoid a bottleneck
 in data transfer between a host CPU and an FPGA. Another
 multi-FPGA LBM system [2] has significant limitation in
 scalability due to the data transfer. Parallel computing with
 low-latency ADN achieves almost linear scalability to the

 The main objective of this demonstration is to present our
 recent progress of scalable and real-time fluid simulation on
 a node of our tightly-coupled FPGA cluster. In this demon-
 stration, we will present a cluster node with four Stratix IV
 FPGAs, and real-time LBM fluid simulation and visuzliza-
 tion with complex boundary configuration of a flow field.
 We will also show the system-on-programmable-chip design
 of the LBM accelerator, and linear scalability with four FP-
 GAs in comparison with performance of CPU-based LBM.
