 Abstract—This paper uses the case of author Michael Field,
 the shared writing identity of two late Victorian women, to
 consider the implications of embracing the semantic web for
 humanities research. It is argued that the ontologies prevalent
 today reveal a lack of nuance when it comes to the complex
 relationships that are the focus of much humanities research,
 such as the connection of names to persons, particularly with
 respect to authorship. Further, the current state of ontology
 use aside, even the sophisticated use of OWL, SKOS, or
 ontology alignment techniques for linking big semantic web
 collections stands to hinder humanities research by hiding
 rather than exposing difference. We use the outlier Michael
 Field to highlight what much of the valuable work of the
 humanities is about and in doing so bring to the fore the
 challenge of formalizing complex social meanings that can
 otherwise be overlooked or dismissed as a trivial technicality.
 As a solution the humanities community is encouraged to begin
 engaging more directly in the construction of semantic web
 tools and infrastructure.

 I. HUMANITIES SCHOLARSHIP AND THE SEMANTIC WEB
 Humanities scholars have long recognized the potential
 of linking datasets to allow illumination of subject areas
 via computer-based analysis and for providing new forms of
 access to the vast array of texts and other materials where
 much of our intellectual and cultural history resides. While
 the majority of primary and secondary material collections in
 digital form remain effectively siloed, immense strides have
 been made towards freeing these over the past few years,
 enabling us to begin investigating “the kinds of humanistic
 phenomena” that “appear only at scale” [28].
 The path to the current state of affairs began with coining
 “semantic web” in 2001 [3] and since then the number of
 data sources available in formats suitable for linked open
 data has increased exponentially. In 2007 there were just 12
 data sets published as linked open data, but by 2011 this
 number had increased to 295 [27]. As of writing (August
 2013) the CKAN data hub currently boasts 6,136 data sets
 meant to be connected and shared [11]. After a period of
 caution, we are now witnessing a decided increase in the
 uptake of linked open data standards and semantic web tech-
 nologies for humanities research. This uptake is expressed
 in three sorts of contributions: aggregations of humanities
 relevant information; specialty topic explorations; and tools
 [7].
 Aggregator projects collect together massive amounts of
 information providing a one-stop-shop of sorts for informa-
 tion attached to a particular theme or topic. They archive
 a wide range of historical materials for aggregation and
 discovery, such as Europeana or PELAGIOS, or provide a
 more focused but no less extensive collection of materials
 by type or theme, such as is done by NINES.
 There also exist much smaller projects that stand out
 because of the special attention that is given to curating
 the information that they hold. What they lack in breadth
 they attempt to make up for with depth and/or prototyp-
 ing alternative ways to interact with the information they
 present. Linked Jazz and InPhOare exemplars of this sort
 of humanities contribution to linked data and the semantic
 web.
 More generalized tools are also being built to allow
 humanists to contribute to interact with and contribute to
 semantic web materials, including Pundit, SharedCanvas,
 AustESE, and CWRC-Writer. These tools have all been
 developed in relation to humanities or memory institution
 projects.
 These sorts of projects unify like-minded communities,
 reflecting the premises of the semantic web:
 [T]he Semantic Web is built up from small
 like-minded communities that can find agreement
 on terms amongst themselves. Applications, then,
 can and do interact without attempting to achieve
 global consensus. There is no requirement for
 global ontologies: instead, an application need
 only map the terms relevant for a particular trans-
 action into a common vocabulary. Of course,
 though agreement need only be local, adoption of
 existing vocabularies facilitates data sharing and
 integration. [52]

What humanists ultimately want from the semantic web
 is not only access to all material, and only that material,
 of interest to a particular inquiry but also the ability to
 extract from the massive aggregation of separate datasets
 new leads, connections or insights. That is, they subscribe
 to the hope that it will be possible to use the semantic content
 and structures of semantic web data to produce knowledge
 that could not be arrived at by other means. To address
 these demands requires a balancing act between collecting
 as much as we can and ignoring what is not of interest,
 between errors of admission and errors of omission, and
 between taking too much and taking too little. Currently
 we are erring on the side of taking too much as we gather
 together masses of information in the twin hopes that we
 can sort out what is of value later and that the aggregation
 itself will produce information of value. Such are the drives
 of the big data movement.
 Within this context, we consider how the development of
 the semantic web is shaping up for the humanities. Much
 of what is offered here emerges from work being done to
 connect a significant humanities datastore with the semantic
 web. The datastore—published as Orlando: Women’s Writ-
 ing in the British Isles from the Beginnings to the Present—
 is a born-digital reference and research resource comprised
 of more than 1,300 detailed biocritical entries, capturing
 over 27,000 individual people plus extensive historical and
 bibliographical detail [41], [8]. The prose within each entry
 has been marked up using XML to identify information
 related to authors’ lives and writing careers, contextual
 material, timelines, sets of internal links, and bibliographies
 [6]. With the integration of the Orlando Project data with
 the semantic web as the background for this inquiry, we first
 summarize one major shortcoming of current approaches to
 building humanist data stores for connectivity to either the
 linked data cloud or the semantic web. After briefly outlining
 the particular importance of naming and the representation
 of identities, we then provide the specific example of the late
 Victorian writer Michael Field, exploring the challenges it
 poses to the treatment of personal identity within a semantic
 web context. We argue that even the most sophisticated use
 of ontologies like OWL or SKOS, or the use of ontology
 alignment techniques, will not allow linked data and the
 semantic web to meet some fundamental requirements of
 humanities researchers. The current approach to the semantic
 web, with its background assumptions and practical imple-
 mentations, actually runs counter to the achievement of our
 long-term goals. This problem can be solved at least in
 part, we argue, if humanities researchers revise both our
 expectations and the direction of the development of data
 repositories, inference engines, and ontology standards.
 II. THE EROSION OF DIFFERENCE THROUGH
 AGGREGATION
 Granting that linked (open) data and the semantic web
 are both still in their relative infancy or just past what the
 Gartner Group refers to as the peak of inflated expectations
 [21], [37], there are still elements about the current state
 of affairs and its future tendencies that are of concern to
 humanists. Indeed, both the potential and the shortcomings
 of existing large data sets for much humanities research
 have received much attention, particularly as manifest in
 the concepts of “distant reading” and “culturenomics” [35],
 [36], [38]. While there are many challenges to integrating
 humanities data with the semantic web, the focus here is on
 the erosion of markers of difference through aggregation.
 Humanists research diverse aspects of human culture and
 cultural processes on both large and small scales, with a
 particular emphasis on the relationship of cultural processes
 and products to their connections with human agents. To the
 extent that RDF is built to work with and through machine-
 processable ontologies, the implications for knowledge rep-
 resentation and knowledge construction are massive, and are
 a major source of the attraction to linked data frameworks.
 For the humanities the move to linked open data and the
 semantic web is potentially paradigm-shifting, presenting a
 tantalizing prospect of the opportunity to access, investigate,
 and make sense of human culture on an unprecedented scale.
 The flexibility of linked data technology lies in the fact
 that each datastore can be given its own vocabulary and
 ontology to suit its needs and link out to other datastores as
 desired, at least in principle. However, linking up datastores
 often means connecting different vocabularies and ontolo-
 gies. This in turn brings with it a pressure towards general-
 ization rather than specificity because of the deep complex-
 ities involved in both generating and aligning ontologies of
 any non-trivial sophistication. While there are sophisticated
 ontologies being developed and implemented for specific
 domains and projects, the norm by far for most semantic web
 projects, including humanities ones, is to cherry-pick terms
 from existing ontologies that strike them as generally useful
 for cobbling together their own vocabulary [29], [46]. In
 the actual implementations of most semantic web datastores
 and aggregators, precision and richness are often foregone
 in favour of matching up with widely-used ontologies. This
 translates into generalization and loss of specificity, making
 the aggregated data less useful for humanities inquiry than it
 might otherwise be. Dominic Oldman of the British Museum
 eloquently summarizes the situation:
 [M]any linked data points lack the quality to
 be more than basic information jukeboxes that, in
 turn, support applications with limited usefulness
 and shelf life. In short, the current cultural heritage
 linked data movement, concentrating on access (a
 fundamental objective), may have ignored some of
 78
reasons for establishing networks of knowledge in
 the first place. [39]
 The rationale for linking data, he implies, includes not
 merely ease of access, the low-hanging fruit enabled by
 the consolidation of datasets, but the larger prize of seeing
 culture otherwise than we can with our current data and
 methods. It is certainly true that “a little semantics goes a
 long way,” [23] but to have more than catalogues that erase
 the specifics of difference in the interests of aggregation we
 need a little bit more than “a little semantics.”
 Difference, as in distinctions of particularity, specificity,
 and locality of meaning, provides us with the ability to
 make sense of the complexities of human records and
 human lives. Difference also means difference from the
 norm: the marginalization and anomalousness associated
 with categories such as race, gender, or nation are regis-
 ters of difference. Difference is key to understanding how
 literature, culture, and ideas develop. The semantic web, as a
 tool for connecting and representing human knowledge and
 understanding on a massive scale, is poised to either promote
 or hide difference, and differences in approach matter.
 Consider a couple of the most widely used ontologies.
 FOAF, the Friend of a Friend ontology that was originally
 intended as a supplement/alternative to social networking
 websites, describes what constitutes a “person” thus:
 The Person class represents people. Something
 is a Person if it is a person. We don’t nitpic about
 whether they’re alive, dead, real, or imaginary. The
 Person class is a sub-class of the Agent class, since
 all people are considered ’agents’ in FOAF. [5]
 This “no nitpicking” approach ensures that the ontology is
 flexible enough to appeal to many users by covering all pos-
 sible understandings of personhood. A similar move towards
 broad generalization is made in the Dublin Core Metadata
 Initiative [15], an ontology directed towards capturing the
 relationships that persons have to the things that they create.
 Here there are only two roles which can be assigned to a
 person: they must either be a creator or a contributor. DCMI
 does this to maximize its applicability to a wide range of
 works and to simplify the application of these properties to
 the persons involved. There is no need to decide if a person
 is an artist or an author or an architect: they are all brought
 together under one or the other of these two terms.
 Clearly, neither of these two highly generalized ap-
 proaches reflects the kind of differences routinely recognized
 by humanists in the course of scholarly inquiry. If we
 presume that such distinctions are fundamental to humanist
 work, it is clear that the mountains of data we are amassing
 using such ontologies will support only very limited types
 of inquiry or inference.
 III. WHAT’S IN A NAME?
 Names are important because the act of naming allows
 us to differentiate the particular from the general in our
 thoughts and ideas. Names thus produce affordances with
 which we are able to separate, capture, and manipulate
 tokens from a sea of types. As Hope Olson argues in her
 critical study of library subject representation: “Naming is
 the act of bestowing a name, of labelling, of creating an
 identity” [40]. Indeed, much of the power of the semantic
 web comes from the ability to name entities and to link
 materials across disparate sources.
 Olson’s observation of naming as an act of identity cre-
 ation suggests an important bridge between naming and per-
 sonhood through the concept of identity. In many instances
 naming is a foundational act of creating persons specifically
 because it provides an identity where there previously was
 none, a simultaneous creation of an individual and an
 extension of the group bestowing the name. At times this act
 of naming leads the way to personifications that challenge
 our understanding of personhood in complex ways (consider
 how the naming of both corporations and stuffed animals
 leads us to lean towards treating them both as persons in
 potentially controversial ways). Our concern here is that
 personhood is both a complex and a crucial characteristic
 that ontologies must be designed to capture appropriately,
 lest some of our understandings of the world fail to be
 addressed.
 What is at stake in such designs is the ability of the
 resulting ontology to capture adequately not just the nuances
 of a relationship between persons, organizations, objects,
 and other such things, but for these relationships to be
 captured in ways that are even broadly correct. As a trivial
 example, consider an ontology that merged FOAF and the
 DCMI (a reasonable assumption since these are two of the
 most popular ontologies [29]). In doing so, an ontology
 designer would be left with only two roles in the DCMI
 to equate to the people captured in FOAF: they could be
 either a dc:contributor or dc:creator. Regardless of how this
 combination is pitched, it amounts to a flattening out of
 relationships that makes detailed inquiry into authorship and
 reception an extremely difficult prospect. This flattening is
 not so much a matter of mistaken ontology combination as
 it is poor ontology selection. For poor ontology combination
 in action, let us consider the case of Michael Field.
 IV. MICHAEL FIELD
 Humanists have been at work for more than two decades,
 since the days of the earliest graphical browsers, to populate
 the web with more diverse content about women writers.
 A major aim of the Orlando Project, for instance, was
 specifically to increase the representation of women both
 on the web and in literary history [8]. This concern goes
 beyond academia: the Rewriting Wikipedia Project initiated
 in May 2013 tackled the well-known gender gap in the most
 commonly used encyclopedia in the world, particularly with
 respect to women from marginalized groups [25], [20]. So
 there remains a strong impetus to attempt to rectify the
 79
omissions and biases of history and of mainstream culture
 by promoting knowledge of women’s achievements.
 Women also constitute a particularly good class of people
 through which to consider relationships between names and
 identities, given that the institutionalization of women’s
 name changes through marriage in many Western countries
 means that an individual woman often uses several names
 over the course of a lifetime. This makes it hard to connect
 all the different names to the same historical individual,
 presenting a long-standing problem with respect to library
 cataloguing, census research, and other indexing systems.
 Women writers present an even better test case for testing the
 ability of semantic web representations to handle complex
 relationships between names and identities. Virginia Woolf
 remarked in 1928, “I would venture to guess that Anon,
 who wrote so many poems without signing them, was often
 a woman” [50], [45], and considered it an indication of
 the extent to which writing has been fraught for women in
 Western European culture. Much inquiry into the gendering
 of the field of literary production and reception has focused
 on the extent of, the reasons underlying, and the impact
 of the adoption of anonymity and pseudonymity by female
 authors [18], [34], [16], [30].
 The author Michael Field was the product of an artistic
 collaboration between Katherine Harris Bradley and Edith
 Emma Cooper during the late nineteenth and early twentieth
 centuries. Bradley and Cooper are marginalized and outliers
 in several ways. An aunt and niece by marriage, they were
 avowed lovers in a historical period in which lesbianism,
 even less than homosexuality, was without a public name
 or identity. They represent an unusual type of authorship,
 having written together under the name and the shared
 identity of “Michael Field” after first publishing under the
 dual pseudonyms of Arran and Isla Leigh [8]. These two
 biological and historical entities operated as a single author,
 but they carried their shared pseudonym also over into their
 private life, in which Katherine was Michael and Edith
 variously Field, Henry, Hennery, Henny, or Hennie-boy [13].
 Then there is their relationship to the name of Sappho, the
 ancient Greek poet at the head of the lyric tradition of
 Western poetry whose name was becoming a rallying point
 for an emergent lesbian subculture [44]. Sappho’s remaining
 fragmentary texts (a potent example of the extent to which
 humanities data can never be complete) were literally incor-
 porated into the lyric poems of the Michael Field’s Long
 Ago in such a way that, as Yopie Prins argues, “Bradley
 and Cooper appropriate Sappho as a name simultaneously
 proper and improper, their own and not their own” [43].
 Field’s name is thus layered and complex in its relation-
 ship to historical personhood: in addition to Bradley and
 Cooper, there is also Sappho, about whom so little is known
 that she is almost as much of a construction as Michael
 Field, and the familiar variants of the pseudonym used by
 the two women in everyday life. The properties of Field
 are equally complex in relation to both gender and number.
 Holly Laird [26] uses a female pronoun, while Lisa Prins
 [43] and Orlando [41] use the third-person plural, and yet the
 name was clearly chosen by the women as a singular, mascu-
 line authorial identity invoked as “him”. Male pseudonyms
 adopted by women are interestingly bisexual, in that they
 carry in their motivations traces of the socialized femininity
 of the author even as they publicly perform masculinity.
 The singularity of the pseudonym, however, might equally
 also be applied to the female union of Bradley and Cooper,
 who considered themselves married [19]. As Lorraine York
 notes, this “pronomially irregular relationship” led Robert
 Browning to send, via a mutual friend of Field, greetings to
 “both of him” [51]. A unifying view is manifestly wrong.
 So too is a divisional view. And like much of humanities
 research, saying that the truth is somewhere in between is
 of no help at all.
 As Laird comments, “Field in fact anticipates the feminist,
 historicizing scholar, the scholar who seeks representations
 of women and gender in the fracturing mirror of past texts in
 order to put the fragments together in her own documents”
 [26]. In other words, to smooth out and create a unified
 identity from the differences embedded in the signature of
 Michael Field would be to miss the point of that signature
 and erase history. Let us turn then to the view of Michael
 Field that we gain from existing linked data.
 DBpedia is a Linked Data project based on structured
 information derived from Wikipedia entries [2], [12]. Look-
 ing at the DBpedia entry for Michael Field, visualized as
 network graph in Figure 1, begins to reveal the sorts of
 problems that can arise in using RDF to describe such a
 complex entity.
 Figure 1. DBpedia sends Michael Field to College
 In the representation provided in DBpedia, Michael Field
 takes on interesting properties based both on what is said and
 on what is not said. To begin, Field is asserted to be identical
 with Bradley. This makes it the case that any property
 that is attributed to her gets attributed to Field because
 OWL defines the sameAs relationship as satisfying the
 strongest identity claim possible [52]. DBpedia goes further,
 reaching outside itself and linking to Freebase, another RDF
 80
based knowledge store. Freebase asserts that Field went to
 Newnham College and is female. Of course neither of these
 is true. It was Bradley who went to Newnham—a full ten
 years before her collaboration with Cooper produced Field—
 and Field is not female (at least not female with the certainty
 asserted here by DBpedia/Freebase, given the complexities
 outlined above).
 Further, based on the DBpedia representation a reasonable
 take-away would be that Field is the actual person and
 perhaps Bradley is the artistic creation. But note that not
 even inverting these assertions makes things right because
 the DBpedia approach does not include the contributions of
 Cooper at all.
 Even a scholarly literary resource dedicated to the history
 of difference has trouble capturing Field. The scholars
 behind Orlando privileged the publishing persona that arose
 from the collaboration between Bradley and Cooper, and
 therefore produced a lengthy entry on “Michael Field”,
 rather than entries on each woman individually. This entry is
 marked up with XML using the project’s bespoke schema.
 However, while the prose captures the complex nature of
 Field as an entity, the XML does not. As translated into
 RDF from the Orlando schema, Field ends up being born
 twice and dying twice, and is made out to be female, when
 the intention behind the partnership was to allow the women
 to operate as male within the literary scene of the day. So
 the RDF extracted from the entry is both factually inaccurate
 and impoverished. The network graph captured in Figure 2
 should make the limitations clear.
 Figure 2. Orlando allows that Michael Field was born and died twice
 V. IMPLICATIONS FOR THE HUMANITIES AND THE
 SEMANTIC WEB
 At this point it may seem that the problem here is
 that the wrong schemas and ontologies are being used or
 that there is no real issue here because Field is such an
 outlier that invoking him—or her—or them—amounts to
 scholarly nitpicking. Michael Field might also be seen as
 the sort of problem that can be solved by some alternative
 use of the tools at hand (e.g. not using owl:sameAs) or
 some other simple/clever technical solution. We urge caution
 against comfortably settling into any of these dismissive
 conclusions.
 Not every problem that has arisen from this process is
 amenable to a technical solution. The author Michael Field
 brings to the fore the extent to which the construction of
 ontologies poses a real challenge. While Field could be
 shoehorned into existing ontologies as either a pseudonym
 or a corporate author, we contend that neither is an adequate
 representation of the relationship, even in combination.
 Indeed Field has been pretty much shoehorned into the
 DBpedia ontology with the results outlined above. Though it
 is in some respects highly unusual, in other ways Field’s case
 is far from unique. Fuzziness with respect to the relationship
 between names and cultural creators entangles authorship
 and personhood in ways that result in confusion and outright
 error in numerous semantic web representations.
 The case of Field is not a mistake that can be easily
 cleared up: it is not as if someone has mislabeled a dog fish
 as a dog. Rather, the problems arise because the DBpedia,
 Freebase, and Orlando Project ontologies apply properties
 related to personhood in commonsensical and normalizing
 fashions that are inadequate for capturing the complexities
 of Field. Field is, in sum, an entity who challenges the very
 concept of personhood. We get by with our everyday under-
 standings, in life and in most Linked Data contexts, because
 most cases do not give rise to the kinds of strangeness we
 see in the RDF representations of Field. We could take
 the FOAF “no nitpicking” route and just let everything
 in, but that avoids the problem. Field is the ontological
 equivalent of approaching the speed of light, a fringe case
 beyond everyday experience, indicating that our common
 sense understandings and knowledge may not be as perfect
 as we treat them as being, both within a semantic web
 context and elsewhere.
 An adequate representation of the particular kind of
 personhood and authorship embedded in the signature of
 “Michael Field” seems to us impossible within the terms
 of existing bibliographical ontologies or other more general
 ontologies. Nor is this a case of sloppy popular ontologies
 vs. rigorous expert ontologies: neither the widely employed
 FRBR (Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records)
 nor PRO (Publishing Roles Ontology), is a help in tackling
 this problem. Even constructing a new ontology to account
 for the particular challenges posed by Field would only
 serve to address the symptom rather than the underlying
 cause: the messiness hidden behind our everyday ontological
 assumptions.
 Any nuance that might be built into a new ontology,
 moreover, would likely be obscured if that data were brought
 into use alongside other data sets, since in that context it
 would likely be generalized to match up with the limited
 81
vocabulary of a more standard ontology such as Dublin
 Core. An example of this kind of effect is that in the Virtual
 International Authority File (VIAF), a major resource com-
 prised of the records of leading national libraries worldwide,
 twenty-first-century editor Sharon Bickle shows up as co-
 author with Michael Field, the Victorian author she edited
 [48]. Sappho and composer Johann Strauss, Jr are also listed
 as co-Authors. This is not an insignificant problem on a
 small scale and if Swoogle is to be believed and there are
 really over 10,000 namespaces as part of the semantic web
 [47] the problem is anything but small.1
 Again, it may be tempting to assert that this is merely
 a technical problem that can be solved by the appropriate
 use of an ontology like SKOS, the clever use of OWL,
 or even the creation of a new ontology custom built for
 the purpose of making such problems go away. What such
 solutions really amount to are acts of ontology integration
 and while technically plausible in theory in practice they
 present significant challenges that only well funded projects
 have the capacity to pursue.
 Ontology integration is a well-known and growing prob-
 lem on the semantic web for which there are no general
 solutions that come without costs. The most robust of these
 solutions is what Pinto et al. count as integration proper
 [42]. This approach assembles a new purpose-built ontology
 from the pieces of other ontologies. The connective logic
 is worked out at each step and a new ontology results.
 Understandably, there is a great deal of work and reflection
 that needs to go into this process, and so this approach is not
 undertaken lightly if accuracy is even remotely important.
 A second approach discussed by Pinto et al. is merging.
 Here existing ontologies are combined together in a way
 that produces a new ontology but without dismantling the
 original ontologies. OWL offers two ways to do this: use
 owl:imports or use owl:sameAs. Again, both come at a price.
 owl:imports amounts to taking the union of all the on-
 tologies that fall under its scope. Of course, this opens the
 door to serious problems, not the least of which is that it
 fails to allow for filtering of any sort, simply accepting other
 ontologies—and any uses they have made of owl:imports—
 outright, paving the way for ontology explosions [22].
 owl:sameAs allows a property from one ontology to be
 equated with another in the strictest sense. Using this
 powerful declaration brings with it all the problems of the
 owl:import but with the additional inheritance of the features
 of each property into the other.
 There are other approaches but they all amount to the
 same thing, finding new ways to relate terms used within
 one context to the terms used in another. What is important
 to note here is not that potential solutions already exist in
 the database and knowledge base communities, but that the
 1Even if the more conservative estimates of others [46], [10], [29] are
 more accurate the challenge of integration remains significant.
 humanities community is not engaging with these solutions
 on any significant scale. Rather, the humanities community
 is focused on building large repositories and continues to
 choose the assert the most threadbare vocabularies as the
 means of enabling this goal. As suggested earlier, the con-
 sequence of this will be information juke boxes, repositories
 that are able to dish up preselected information through
 generic interfaces, but little more. If we are really interested
 in making the semantic web a tool which will allow us to
 see interesting things that we could not perceive otherwise,
 then we need to recognize that limiting the complexity of
 vocabularies and ontologies so that we can easily collect as
 much information as possible together will not achieve this
 end.
 What the humanities community needs to be doing on a
 larger scale is the following:
 1) Constructing more custom ontologies directed at cap-
 turing humanities-relevant information rather than
 adopting those built by other communities for other
 purposes;
 2) Pursuing the ontology integration techniques already
 developed to address the challenges of integration,
 despite their complexity and the real possibility that
 they will not work;
 3) Designing inference engines specifically for humani-
 ties research.
 What these activities amount to is engaging in the prac-
 tice of building and contributing to the infrastructure of
 the semantic web rather than the practice of adding new
 repositories to an already existing infrastructure. The erosion
 of difference as a result of the tendency towards homoge-
 nization that is evident in large data aggregations is not the
 only challenge that humanists will need to overcome in order
 to work meaningfully with the semantic web. Others include
 overcoming the assumed facticity and completeness of the
 information that is being aggregated [14], and the limitations
 of the deductive logic framework that is assumed by the
 majority of ontologies and inference tools available [32]. If
 we do not engage with the complexity of the challenges
 facing us with respect to data aggregation, then we should
 not be surprised when the joy of being able to do faceted
 searches in a one portal rather than many wears off, leaving
 us wondering what happened to the promise of the semantic
 web to allow us to discover that which we did not already
 know, to help us plumb the specificities of our vast stores
 of knowledge for new insights.
 VI. CONCLUSION
 In sum, the semantic web ontologies prevalent today
 reveal a lack of nuance when it comes to the complex
 relationships between names and persons, particularly with
 respect to authorship. Moreover, the generalizations required
 to link semantic web collections risk weakening the ability
 of their data representations to reflect the complexities of
 82
cultural artifacts and processes. Tim Berners-Lee stresses
 the extent to which linking across specific vocabularies, in
 his view, takes precedence over specific vocabularies:
 The library community has historically seen
 the Semantic Web as primarily about metadata.
 While that is important, it is only one aspect
 of the larger picture. There is financial data,
 chemical data, biotechnology data, experimental
 data, geographic data and more. All of these
 domains have their own vocabularies, with few
 explicit points of connection. The Semantic Web is
 aimed at bridging those gaps, and allowing links
 across fields. Libraries have long understood the
 importance of established vocabularies, and have
 led in their development. To the extent that data
 can be encoded in common syntaxes like RDF
 and described with public vocabularies, they can
 be more accessible and more useful. People and
 applications can draw better correlations, better
 connections, better inferencing, and these can lead
 us to more effective use of information. [49]
 “Public” here really equates to a standardized vocabulary,
 or linked to a standard vocabulary, which in effect means
 that local vocabularies need to be equated or generalized to
 standard vocabularies in order for the promised amelioration
 to take place. RDF is clearly emerging as a standard that
 is effecting significant changes in how data is represented,
 exchanged, and used on the web, and it relies on standard
 ontologies to serve as the bridges between specialist vocab-
 ularies. Standard ontologies can thus enable technological
 progress, but those devising and employing them need also
 to be mindful of the negative impacts of standardization
 powerfully articulated by Geoffrey Bowker and Susan Leigh
 Star:
 Information scientists work every day on the
 design, delegation, and choice of classification sys-
 tems and standards, yet few see them as artifacts
 embodying moral and aesthetic choices that in turn
 craft people’s identities, aspirations and dignities.
 [4]
 While many standards, particularly technical ones and
 ones associated with the natural sciences, have arisen with-
 out the kind of attentiveness to difference outlined above,
 the critique of such standards is growing: witness the recent
 success of Melissa Terras in having the Text Encoding Initia-
 tive guidelines, which previously embedded the encoding of
 women literally as the second sex, revised [1]. Other related
 initiatives consider how best to model fluid difference, along
 with explorations of how encoding practices can leverage
 established standards without acceding to their terms [31].
 Such work intersects with the Orlando Project’s attempt to
 translate into RDF its tagset for encoding “cultural forma-
 tion,” which is attentive to historical and cultural specificity
 related to such identity categories as sexuality, ethnicity,
 race and colour, and linguistic roots [9]. More theoretically,
 Tara McPherson has begun investigating the ideological
 implications of the base technologies, such as the UNIX
 operating system, that are shaping our digital work in the
 humanities [33].
 The questions raised here are important given the increas-
 ing uptake of semantic web technologies by research projects
 in the humanities, and by resource providers such as libraries
 and museums. As part of this process of adoption, many
 existing ontologies initially developed for other technologies
 and purposes are being translated into semantic web form
 to enable the leveraging of existing metadata in a semantic
 web context. XML schemas in particular are susceptible
 to such translation, and there is increasing production of
 RDF based on existing XML markup. Indeed the W3C
 offers the “ConverterToRdf” tool meant to facilitate such
 translations, whether the migration is to RDF or to the
 ongoing exposure of XML data in RDF form. Moreover,
 resources are increasingly being interlinked not by human
 beings but by algorithms. For instance, in late 2012 a VIAF
 bot successfully added 250,000 links to Wikipedia [48].
 The result will be a much more densely interlinked and,
 one hopes, interoperable semantic web than the current one,
 but its structure will be increasingly determined by its own
 vocabularies and ontologies, which will in turn increasingly
 determine what can be represented meaningfully on the web.
 If this sounds circular, that’s because it is.
 The case of Field helps to lay bare the assumptions
 about the nature of authorship in relation to personhood
 that operate quite naturally, as culturally-specific ideological
 systems do, within our understanding of literary relations,
 and the challenges that the humanities’ interest in the
 unique, the outlier, and the limit cases of culture pose to
 a semantic web framework. This preliminary examination
 of the limitations of existing ontologies, both the one that
 we are deriving from Orlando’s bespoke XML markup and
 well-established ones like Dublin Core, suggests that they
 will not adequately handle border cases, despite the fact that
 marginality and uniqueness are what humanities scholars
 often seek to discover and analyse.
 We are still in the initial stages of investigating the
 implications of semantic web representations for human-
 ist research, particularly as concerns the ability of such
 representations to reflect humanist epistemologies, or ways
 of knowing, adequately. The representation of basic names
 of persons within the semantic web, of their relationships
 to other names, to properties, and to creation, publishing
 reception, or authorship, have implications that reach far
 beyond literary studies or book history to the heart of our
 information systems. The problem does not have to do so
 much with RDF as a form of data representation, but with
 how it is being deployed. Challenging as these cases are,
 the flexibility of the Resource Description Framework that
 83
is leading to these confusions is also paradoxically our best
 hope of arriving at strategies for representing difference
 effectively across large sets of data. Outliers such as Michael
 Field bring to the fore the challenge of formalizing complex
 social meanings such that the resulting web of information
 can operate with a difference.
