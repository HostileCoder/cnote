 Abstract—The next generation of interactive satellite terminals
 is going to play a crucial role in the future of DVB standards. As
 a matter of fact in the current standard, satellite terminals are
 expected to be interactive thus offering apart from the possibility
 of logon signalling and control signalling also data transmission in
 the return channel with satisfying quality. Considering the nature
 of the traffic from terminals that is by nature bursty and with
 big periods of inactivity, the use of a Random Access technique
 could be preferred. In this paper Random Access congestion
 control in DVB-RCS2 is considered with particular regard to
 the recently introduced Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted
 Aloha technique, able to boost the performance compared to
 Slotted Aloha. The paper analyzes the stability of such a channel
 with particular emphasis on the design and on limit control
 procedures that can be applied in order to ensure stability of the
 channel even in presence of possible instability due to statistical
 fluctuations.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 In consumer type of interactive satellite terminals, users
 generate a large amount of low duty cycle and bursty traffic
 with frequent periods of inactivity in the return link. Under
 these operating conditions, the traditionally used Demand As-
 signment Multiple Access (DAMA) satellite protocol does not
 perform optimally, since the response time for the transmission
 of short bursts can be too long. For this reason, in the recently
 released specification for the next generation of Interactive
 Satellite Systems (DVB-RCS2) [1], the possibility of sending
 logon, control and even user traffic using Random Access (RA)
 in timeslots specified by the Network Control Center (NCC)
 is provided to Return Channel Satellite Terminals (RCST). In
 particular, two methods are considered for RA: the first one is
 the well known Slotted Aloha (SA) [2] [3], the second is called
 Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted Aloha (CRDSA) [4]
 [5] [6].
 SA represents a well established RA technique for satellite
 networks in which users send their bursts within slots in
 a distributed manner, i.e. without any central entity coordi-
 nating transmission. While this allows to reach an average
 throughput around 0.36 [packets/slot] despite the possibility
 of collision among bursts from different users, SA works

 with very moderate channel load to ensure acceptable delay
 and loss probability. This gap has been recently filled with
 the introduction of a new technique named CRDSA that is
 able to boost the throughput even up to values close to 1.
 This technique is based on the transmission of a chosen
 number of replicas for each burst payload, similarly to what
 is done in Diversity Slotted Aloha (DSA) [7]. Burst copies
 are randomly placed within a certain number of slots grouped
 in a so called frame. However, differently from DSA, in
 CRDSA each burst copy has a pointer to the location of the
 other replicas of the same burst payload. Therefore, when
 the frame arrives at the receiver an interference cancellation
 (IC) process is accomplished. The IC process consists in
 removing the interfering content of already decoded bursts
 from the remaining slots in which collision occurred, in order
 to try restoring the content of bursts that had all their replicas
 colliding (from which its name). In particular [1] specifies two
 possible variants of CRDSA:
 • Constant Replication Ratio CRDSA (CR-CRDSA): using
 a constant number of replicas for each burst;
 • Variable Replication Ratio CRDSA (VR-CRDSA): using
 a number of replicas that can differ among packets, since
 the number of replicas is determined according to a pre-
 defined probability distribution.
 Document [1] also claims that the applications using the
 interactive network may rely on network internal contention
 control mechanisms to avoid sustained excessive packet loss
 resulting from simultaneous destructive transmissions but the
 definition of such a mechanism is claimed to be out of scope
 for the document. For this reason, in this paper guidelines
 for the design of such a system having simple yet effective
 retransmission policies aiming at avoiding congestion at the
 gateway when using RA in the next generation of satellite
 terminals are presented. To do so, we rely on the analysis
 carried out in [8], in which a stability model for the case of
 CRDSA with geometrically distributed retransmissions was
 presented. The analysis carried out in [8] is based on the
 definition of Equilibrium Contour and Channel Load Line,
 similarly to what was done in [9] for SA. The Equilibrium
 Contour represents a set of circumstances for which the
 ongoing communication is in equilibrium, in the sense that
 the number of newly transmitted packets is equal to the
number of packets successfully sent so that the total number
 of packets ”queuing for retransmission” do not change. The
 Channel Load Line completes the analysis telling which of
 these equilibrium points are actually of equilibrium for a
 given scenario, depending on the user population and on the
 probability that a user has a new packet to transmit. Based
 on this model it is possible to understand where this points of
 equilibrium for the ongoing communication are with respect to
 the throughput. For this reason, this paper discusses parameter
 settings able to ensure that the communication is taking place
 in a desirable and stable manner. Moreover, similarly to what
 was done in [10] for SA, control limit procedures able to
 ensure congestion control in DVB-RCS2 when using CRDSA
 as transmission mode are discussed.
 II. SYSTEM OVERVIEW
 Consider a multi-access channel populated by a total num-
 ber of users M. Users are synchronized so that the channel
 is divided into slots and Ns consecutive slots are grouped
 to constitute a so called frame. The probability that at the
 beginning of a frame an idle user has a packet to transmit
 is p0. When a frame starts, users having a packet to transmit
 place l copies of the same packet over the Ns slots of that
 frame. The number of copies l can be either the same for each
 packet or not. Packet copies are nothing else than redundant
 replicas except for the fact that each one contains a pointer to
 the location of the others. These pointers are used in order to
 attempt restoring collided packets at the receiver by means of
 Successive IC. For the sake of simplicity, throughout the paper
 perfect IC and channel estimation are assumed which means
 that the only cause of disturbance for the correct reception
 of packets is interference among them. Moreover, FEC and
 possible power unbalance are not considered. Given these
 conditions, consider the example in Figure 1 representing a
 frame at the receiver for the case of 2 copies per packet. Each
 slot can be in one of three states:
 • no packet’s copies have been placed in a given slot, thus
 the slot is idle;
 • only 1 packet’s copy has been placed in a given slot, thus
 the packet is correctly decoded;
 • more than 1 packet’s copy has been placed in a given slot,
 thus resulting in interference of all involved packets.
 In DSA, if all copies for a given packet collided the packet is
 surely lost. In CRDSA, if at least one copy of a certain packet
 has been correctly received (see User 4), the contribution of
 the other copies of the same packet can be removed from the
 other slots. This process might allow to restore the content
 of packets that had all their copies colliding (see User 2) and
 iteratively other packets may be correctly decoded up to a
 point in which no more packets can be restored (or until the
 maximum number of iterations Imax for the IC process is
 reached, if a limit has been fixed).
 When a retransmission process is present, if a packet has
 not been decoded at the end of the SIC process a feedback
 is used in order to inform users about the eventual failure of
 their transmission thus giving birth to a closed loop between

 the transmitter and the receiver. Since this could cause the
 channel to get to a state of congestion, a certain policy able to
 retransmit unsuccessful packets and transmit newly generated
 packets while keeping the channel in a desirable point of
 operation is of great interest.
 III. CHANNEL STABILITY MODEL
 In this section we quickly revise the channel stability
 model introduced in [8]. Consider the communication system
 introduced in Section II. Each user can be in one of two
 states: Thinking (T) or Backlogged (B). Users in T state
 are idle users that generate a packet for transmission within
 a frame interval with probability p0; if they do, no other
 packets are generated until successful transmission for that
 packet has been acknowledged. Users in B state are users that
 failed in successfully transmitting their packet and thus are
 attempting to retransmit it (the probability that they retransmit
 is pr in each frame). In the followings, we assume that users
 are acknowledged about the success of their transmission at
 the end of the frame (i.e. immediate feedback). From [8], we
 define
 • NfB : backlogged packets at the end of frame f
 • GfB =
 N(f?1)B pr
 Ns : expected channel load of frame f due
 to users in B state
 • GfT : expected channel load of frame f due to users in
 T state
 • GfIN = G
 f
 T +G
 f
 B : expected total channel load of framef
 • PLRf (GfIN , Ns, l, Imax) : expected packet loss ratio of
 frame f , with dependence on the expected total channel
 load GIN , the frame size Ns, the burst degree distribution
 l and the maximum number of iterations for the SIC
 process Imax
 • GfOUT = G
 f
 IN (1 ? PLRf (GfIN , Ns, l, Imax)) : part of
 load successfully transmitted in frame f , i.e. throughput.
 The equilibrium contour can then be described as
 GT = GOUT = GIN (1? PLR(GIN , Ns, l, Imax)) (1)

 for any NB (i.e. the expected channel input is constant and
 independent on the number of backlogged packets). Notice that
 the frame number f is not present, since in equilibrium con-
 ditions always the same value of throughput and backlogged
 users is expected.
 A. Definition of Stability
 Equilibrium contours represented in Figure 2 divide the
 (NB ,GT ) plane in two parts and each channel load line can
 have one or more intersections with the equilibrium contour.
 These intersections are referred to as equilibrium points since
 GOUT = GT . The rest of the points of the channel load line
 belong to one of two sets: those on the left of the equilibrium
 contour represent points for which GOUT > GT , thus situa-
 tions that yield to decrease of the backlogged population; those
 on the right represent points for which GOUT < GT , thus
 situations that yield to growth of the backlogged population.
 From the considerations above, we can gather that an
 intersection point where the channel load line enters the left
 part for increasing backlogged population corresponds to a
 stable equilibrium point, since it acts as a sink. In particular,
 if the intersection is the only one, the point is a globally stable
 equilibrium point (indicated as GGT ,NGB ) while if more than
 one intersection is present, it is a locally stable equilibrium
 point (indicated as GST ,NSB). If an intersection point enters the
 right part for increasing backlogged population, it is said to
 be an unstable equilibrium point (indicated as GUT ,NUB ) in the
 sense that as soon as a statistical variation from the equilibrium
 point occurs, the communication will diverge in one of the two
 directions of the channel load.
 Figure 2(a) shows a stable channel. The globally stable
 equilibrium point can be referred as channel operating point
 in the sense that we expect the channel to operate around that
 point. With the word around we mean that due to statistical
 fluctuations, the actual GT and NB (and thus also GIN and
 GOUT ) may differ from the expected values. In fact, the model
 deals with the expected values of GT and GB , and the actual
 values have binomially distributed probability for GB and GT
 with finite M and Poisson distributed probability for GT with
 infinite M . Nevertheless, averaging over the entire history of
 the transmission, simulations in [8] have shown that values
 close to the expected ones are obtained thus validating the
 assumption of considering the expected value.

 number (i.e. the time from the beginning of the communication in frame time
 units.)
 Figures 2(b) and 2(c) show two unstable channels respec-
 tively for finite and infinite number of users. Analyzing this
 two figures for increasing number of backlogged packets, the
 first equilibrium point is a stable equilibrium point. Therefore
 the communication will tend to keep around it as for the
 stable equilibrium point in Figure 2(a) and we can refer to
 it once again as channel operating point. However, this is
not the only point of equilibrium since more intersections
 are present. Therefore, due to the abovementioned statistical
 fluctuations, the number of backlogged users could pass the
 second intersection and return to the right part of the plane,
 causing an unbounded increase of the expected number of
 backlogged users in the case of infinite M (Figure 2(c)) or an
 increase till a new intersection point is reached in the case of
 finite M (Figure 2(b)). In the latter case, this third intersection
 point is another stable equilibrium point known as channel
 saturation point, so called because it is a condition in which
 almost any user is in B state and GOUT approaches zero. In
 the former case of infinite M , NB will increase indefinitely
 and we can say that a channel saturation point is present for
 NB ? ∞. The effect of this saturation is that the related
 throughput falls off to a value close to zero as illustrated in
 Figure 3 for the case of unstable channel with finite M . Finally
 Figure 2(d) shows the case of an overloaded channel. In this
 case there is only one equilibrium point corresponding to the
 channel saturation point. Therefore, even though the channel is
 nominally stable, the point of stability occurs in a non-desired
 region. For this reason this case is separated and distinguished
 from what is intended in this work as stable channel.
 IV. DESIGN CHOICES AND PARAMETER SETTINGS
 Given l, NS , Imax, in this section we will extensively dis-
 cuss the role of M , p0, pr and explain how the communication
 state changes when changing them. First of all this is important
 in order to understand the relations to be considered in the
 design phase. Moreover, the same discussion is introductory
 to understand how control policies can help to obtain better
 performance and a stable channel even in case of statistical
 fluctuations that could yield to instability.
 Consider Figure 4. The first thing we can notice is that M
 and p0 only influence the channel load line while changing
 pr corresponds to a change of the equilibrium contour. In
 Figure 4(a) we can see that p0 influences the slope of the
 channel load line that becomes steeper when increasing p0.
 This is intuitive to understand since for fixed M , if pA0 < pB0
 then GAT < GBT . Figure 4(b) shows that M shifts the channel
 load line up and down if the population size is respectively
 increasing or decreasing. From Equation 3 we can notice that
 the value M is nothing else that what is known in literature as
 q, that is the intersection of the line with the y-axis. Finally pr
 determines a shift upward of the channel load line for smaller
 values of pr. As we can see in Figure 4(c) if the value pr is
 sufficiently small, it is possible to stabilize a channel initially
 unstable. This represents the ground base for one of the control
 policies shown in the next section.
 V. CONTROL LIMIT POLICIES
 Previous sections highlighted that statistical variations can
 yield to instability even in case of initially well-performing
 channels (see Figure 3). To render a channel of that type stable
 2 straightforward solutions are available: the first is to use a
 smaller value for the retransmission probability giving then
 rise to a larger backlogged population for the same throughput
 value; the second is to allow a smaller user population size
 M thus resulting in a waste of capacity. A third solution,
 that is the one analyzed in this paper, is the use of control
 limit policies to control unstable channels by applying the
 countermeasures above in a dynamic manner. In this section
 we analyze control procedures of the limit type able to ensure
 stability. This procedures recall those used in [10] for SA. In
 particular two simple yet effective dynamic control procedures
 are considered: the input control procedure (ICP) and the
 retransmission control procedure (RCP). These two control
 procedures are based upon a subclass of policies known as
 control limit policies, in which the space of the policies is

generally composed of two actions and a critical state that
 determines the switch between them, known as control limit.
 In this case the control limit is a critical threshold for a certain
 number of backlogged users ˆNB .
 A. Input Control Procedure
 This control procedure deals with new packets to transmit.
 In particular, two possible actions are possible: accept (action
 a) or deny (action d) and the switch between them is deter-
 mined by the threshold ˆNB as previously mentioned.
 B. Retransmission Control Procedure
 As the name says, the retransmission control procedure
 deals with packets to retransmit and in particular with their
 retransmission probability. In particular two different
 retransmission probabilities pr and pc are defined
 that represent respectively the action taken in normal
 retransmission state (action r) and in critical state (action c).
 From the definition above it is straightforward that it must be
 pr > pc. The switch between these two modes is determined
 by the threshold ˆNB .

 Figure 5 shows two examples corresponding respectively to
 channels using ICP and RCP. As we can see both policies ac-
 complish the same task of ensuring channel stability. However,
 while ICP controls the access of thinking users, RCP controls
 the access of backlogged users.
 VI. SIMULATION RESULTS
 In this section we consider some cases of unstable channels
 that call for a control policy able to prevent them from satura-
 tion. In all the cases analyzed M and p0 are fixed (stationary)
 and we consider pr = 1 and pc small enough to ensure a
 stable channel. All the scenarios have been simulated for 106
 frames. The three scenarios considered are the followings:
 1) CRDSA with 3 replicas, M = 300, p0 = 0.2, pc = 0.39
 resulting in NUB = 25 when pr = 1;
 2) CRDSA with 3 replicas, M = 200, p0 = 0.34, pc = 0.5
 resulting in NUB = 12 when pr = 1;
 3) CRDSA with 2 replicas, M = 220, p0 = 0.25, pc = 0.8
 resulting in NUB = 39 when pr = 1.

 Figure 6 illustrates the results in terms of throughput both
 for ICP and RCP for the study cases enumerated above versus
 ˆNB . Figure 7 shows the related percentage of frames in which
 the channel has NB > ˆNB so that the critical action of the
 control limit policy is applied (d or c depending on the case).
 First of all we can notice that both for ICP and for RCP,
 the range of flatness is wider when operating far from the
 throughput peak. This is really important for the following
 reason. Imagine a real application scenario with large delay (as
 it is the case in satellite communications). Differently from the
 case analyzed in this paper, when the ˆNB threshold is crossed
 the control limit policy needs a certain propagation time before
 it is applied. As a result the effective threshold is not ˆNB but
 some value ˆNB + ∆, where ∆ depends on the drift of the

 number of backlogged users for the particular case and on the
 propagation delay. Therefore the wider is the flat region, the
 less the performance optimality of the controlled channel will
 be influenced by the propagation delay. The reason for this
 difference of flatness can be detected from Figure 7 where it
 can be noticed that in general terms the number of time spent
 in critical state is greater when closer to the throughput peak.
 This comes from the fact that the operating point of stability
 and the point of instability NUB are generally closer when
 approaching the throughput peak while the PLR is greater thus
 determining are more probable drift beyond NUB .
 Let us now consider the difference between the case with
 2 and 3 replicas. As we can see, in the case of 2 replicas a
 degradation of the throughput and a high percentage of time
 spent in the critical state is also found for a small ˆNB value. In
 general terms, when a control limit policy is applied it does
 not make sense to choose ˆNB < NUB , therefore this result
 does not seem to be of interest for our analysis. However let
 us consider once again the case with large propagation delay.
 If NB > ˆNB the control limit policy will switch to critical
 state until NB < ˆNB is verified. But as previously mentioned
 users do not immediately switch state due to the propagation
 delay, so that in this case the critical policy is applied for
 a certain period also when NB is smaller than ˆNB and this
 could result in suboptimal performance especially in the case
 of ICP as shown in Figure 6.
 Last but not least let us discuss the results when instead of
 dynamic control limit policy, the channel is designed by stati-
 cally limiting the number of allowed users or by decreasing the
 retransmission probability so that the channel is always stable.
 Figure 8 shows the case of CRDSA with 3 replicas, M = 300,
 p0 = 0.2, pc = 0.39. In the first case, the number of allowed
 users must be decreased to approximately M = 170 so that the
 resulting average throughput is around 0.32 . The second case
 consists in decreasing the retransmission probability (as done
 in Figure 8 to 0.39). Also in this second case the resulting
 throughput is diminished, although most of the times this
 decrement is of small entity. However another effect is that
 the average packet delay is increased. Therefore depending on
 the application also this second solution could be problematic.
 VII. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
 In this paper a model for computation of the channel stabil-
 ity when using Contention Resolution Diversity Slotted Aloha
 as Random Access mode in DVB-RCS2 has been outlined.
 After analyzing the influence of some crucial parameters such
 as the transmission and retransmission probability and the
 population size, the paper introduces the concept of control
 limit policies for such a technique and outlines empirical
 yet effective procedures for congestion control in case of
 channels that present the possibility of drifting away to a zone
 of saturation with low throughput. Finally, simulation results
 demonstrate how dynamic control limit procedures can help
 avoiding congestion while allowing the channel to behave in
 a optimal manner despite the possibility of instability and also
 in presence of large propagation delay. This work has mainly
 concentrated on the throughput resulting from the application
 of this channel procedures. However this represents only half
 of the story since also the related packet delay associated
 to successful packets is of utmost interest. For this reason
 we are currently preparing an extended version of this work
 where also this second aspect is analyzed together with other
 important points that have been omitted here for the sake of
 concision.
