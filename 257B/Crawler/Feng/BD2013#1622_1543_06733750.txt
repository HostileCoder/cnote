Abstract - The present research as described in this paper tries to 
impart how imitation based learning for behavior-based 
programming can be used to teach the robot. The simulated 
model tries to imitate human GAIT pattern and negotiate push 
with efficient recovery [1]. This paper also proposes the HOAP2 
[2] based biped model to achieve gait cycle imitation and push 
recovery on humanoid. The proposed model follows the Gait 
cycle [1] and can be further used for developing a model capable 
to recover from push similar to human biology. This development 
is a big step in way to prove that push recovery is a software 
engineering problem and not hardware engineering problem. 
The walking algorithm used here aims to select a subset of push 
recovery problem i.e. disturbance from environment. We applied 
the physics at each joint of Halo with some degree of freedom. 
The proposed model, Halo is different from other models as 
previously developed model were inconsistent with data for 
different persons. This would lead to development of the 
generalized biped model in future and will bridge the gap 
between performance and inconsistency. In this paper the 
proposed model is applied to data of different persons. Accuracy 
of model, performance and result is measured using the behavior 
negotiation capability of model developed. In order to improve 
the performance, proposed model gives the freedom to handle 
each joint independently based on the belongingness value for 
each joint. The development can be considered as important 
development for future world of robotics. The accuracy of model 
is 70% in one go. In this paper, we achieve to imitate the human 
gait cycle for HOAP-2 [2] robots model Halo. We validate our 
model by giving different input configuration parameter i.e. 
CoM, CoP and joint angle of different samples to HOAP-2[2] 
model designed in Webots, which can demonstrate the behavior 
as per new configuration provided for different person.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 Push recovery is the behaviour shown by any subject 
towards recovery from unexpected external push. Human Push 
recovery capability is a learning process which human being 
learns through a continuous evolution process. Our two most 
sophisticated parts of central nervous system, right lobe and 
left lobe are used to control and recover from particular push. 
So it is one of the most frequent and quick decision taken by 
humans during normal walking. The problem occurs when 
robot is made to work in similar environments like humans. 
Using LIPM [4] based biped model which is inherently 
unstable and has serious stability problem but due to better 
adaptability, obstacle negotiation capability and stairs 
climbing capability we are using biped model. We as human 
prefer to learn through continuous learning by negotiating 
with environment and by effectively using different strategy to 
impart human learning robot so we are using fuzzy logic based 
controller which counters impreciseness of environment. 
 HOAP2 [2] model is ubiquitous to impart human learning 
to a biped model [3]. The reason for being so commonly used 
is because of properties such as mass, density, inertia, learning 
from examples, physics we can defined and exhibit some 
capability for generalization beyond the sample data [6]. Also 
it has universal approximation property [7]. Fuzzy set and 
logic theory [5] is one of the most prominent tools to handle 
uncertainty in decision-making. The major benefit of using 
fuzzy model is to achieve low cost and more intuitive model. 
Fuzzy model as a tool is easily understandable by human i.e. it 
has sort of knowledge representation for better human 
understandability. Obviously, the fuzzy logic is a tool which 
deals linguistic information [9]. Pattern Classification problem 
can we solved using two most widely techniques learning and 
generalization [10].  
 A biped robot maintains the parameter analogous to 
human body. To impart learning for push recovery it follows 
the process like human body follow. Our model Halo, whose 
architecture is based on HOAP2[1] has twenty-five joints of 
body in all including head with two degree of freedom, left 
and right arm with five DoF, two legs with six DoF[11]. This 
imitates the human gait pattern for its implementation as biped 
[1]. We distribute the mass to all parts, apply the torque and 
inertia on each joint to balance model. The paper uniquely 
identifies the parameters for balancing. To imitate the human 
like behavior on humanoid is very complex thus to exhibit the 
human like behavior sensors on 6 joints are used to capture the 
joint angle and corresponding force sensors, which are used to 
measure the magnitude of applied force [18]. 
 
A. Paper Organization: 
 
 The first section covers the requirement and important 
with respect to other available model. Then second section 
contains a brief discussion of the Fujitsu’s humanoid open 
architecture platform-2 (HOAP-2) robot [1]. The section three 
cover the step of implementation and depth understanding of 
our model presented, generalization parameter of some 
properties such as mass, density, inertial etc. physics 
exhibiting some capability toward development of generalized 
architecture of robot for push recovery and revealed approach 
of the walking humanoid robot in their stance and swing phase 
of human gait cycle [1][17]. Subsequently, we have presented 
the model in Webots and defined parameter and physics 
applied and apply smart hierarchical fuzzy logic based 
controller which covering the degree of membership or non 
membership using intuitive fuzzy set in section three and four.  
 In the result and discussion section we have shown the 
simulate model based on collected experimental data for 
various physical change corresponding to push. Finally we 
concluded the push recovery not only depend push recovery 
not only depends on the person’s height, weight or sex but 
also depends on whether a person is a left or right handed 
[18].These simulations are a big leap in the further 
investigation and development step of real biped humanoid 
robot which will be synergistically similar with the 
human[19]. Some other relevant and recent works in the area 
of humanoid push recovery can be obtained in [22]. 
II. HUMANOID OPEN ARCHITECTURE PLATFORM ROBOT 
The HOAP-2[1] is one of the biped robots of HOAP 
series, developed by Fujitsu for commercial use. It is very 
much popular between research community due to 
resemblance with the human with more DoF and mobility.  
The architectural details are given in manual [1]. The DoF 
which is actually defining the number of parameter to defined 
the all joint configuration which help us to analyze the 
problem of push recovery.

II. OUR APPROACH 
A. The Step of methodology  
  
The objective of this paper is to describe the model which can 
perform the human like Gait cycle and analyze the behavior 
using hierarchical fuzzy algorithm, control the balance of 
lateral plane movements [14] of humanoid robots. We taken 
consideration of the HOAP2 [2] is model because it is 
resemble to human. We organized our methodology in the 
following steps: 
 
Step1:- To simulate the liner inverted pendulum equivalent 
biped model i.e. HOAP2 [1] similar model in Webots. And 
calibrate the all the part and joint with their respective 
physical parameter like degree of freedom, mass, centre of 
mass, height, length of body part etc. 
 
Step2:- To compute the control torques for the joints in a 
bipedal humanoid, change in angle of different joint, gait 
pattern taken from HMCD [3] is of human and finally 
calculate Inverse kinematic and D-H parameter of model. 
 
Step3:-Apply all the above calculated parameter to our model 
i.e. Halo and make it to follow the human gait cycle based on 
real time data captured through HMCD [3]. 
 
Step4:-To gather the sufficient amount of data by our model to 
impart the learning technique. 
 
Step5:- To develop a hierarchical fuzzy module [5] based on 
the data gather through indigenous developed suit HMCD [3] 
and associate same computing on Webots controller to guide 
the our model similar to HOAP2 [1] to follow the gait cycle 
and predict the output angle and velocity on the basis of input 
force and direction around our rule defined in paper. 
 
  Biped which is human resembles inverted pendulum 
structure is inherently unstable and while interacting with 
human will ultimately collide with humans, things and other 
humanoids, So humanoid push and fall recovery is very 
important to make them absorb force and stand up after 
falling. In this paper we tried to address the issue of push 
recovery with referenced to the humanoid robot HOAP2 [1]. 
The experimental data collected through in house developed 
HMCD device used in development of software based model. 
Then to make it follow the human gait cycle, Inverse 
kinematic have been solved for its legs [19], the model also 
has been programmed to be visible dynamically. To make 
advance we involved the two infrared sensors on the eyes of 
biped to identify obstacle in the way. To make it free from 
intensive computation mechanism and impart learning we 
proposed the hierarchical fuzzy system [5].gait cycle style in 
which a human being walks. Gait cycle starts where one foot 
leaves the ground and end it again touches the ground [12]. 
  The control torques can be computed for the joints in 
a bipedal humanoid using the following equations:  
 
 
            ? ? ?????? ? ???, ??? ? ????   (1)   
  
For normal walking pattern, torques can be generated as in 
eqn.(1) which is sum of inertial torque (M), Centrifugal and 
Coriolis torque(C) and gravitational torque (G) together with 
some frictional torques which has been neglected. When 
external force is applied on human, these ideal walking 
patterns of different joint torques get disturbed. To regain 
original torques, control torques required to be applied [8].

Fig3: Details Design of Model 
  
Our model consists of a sphere surmounted on a cylinder 
attached with two limbs. Each Limb is equipped with total 4 
servos, 2 servos at keen and 2 servo at ankle. The servo which 
is used at foot does not play any vital role to move the leg at 
any position but do keep orientation of the feel almost parallel 
to the ground in swing phase and stance phase of gait cycle.  
 Inducing anthropomorphic logic into computers, though 
approximately, is very well handled with Fuzzy Control. 
Designing system and subsequent changes is neatly done 
linguistic variables as compared with mathematical modeling. 
It also come with additional advantages such as faster 
development cycles, precise control and easy to code and easy 
to understand programming. It is necessary to note that fuzzy 
logic and control make way for faster solutions which are in 
acceptable limits and surely are not comparable with high 
computational accuracy of classical mathematical techniques, 
but this compromise is worthy in the sense that these problems 
cannot be fully represented through traditional models. If 
tried, resultant would be too complex having high computation 
cost along with ambiguity in data.  
 Trajectory planning aimed to realize walking of our biped 
consists of two parts. One is swing trajectory, phase in which 
one leg is swinging in air kept in front of the other legs .Other 
part is body trajectory in which swinging leg complete its 
motion and is placed on ground, and body start moving. 
 Inverses Kinematics results in the joint angles 
corresponding to specified location of end-effectors. 
Kinematic equations derived for a serial manipulator are a set 
of polynomials result in multiple configurations for this 
manipulator of chain type. For parallel manipulators, the 
specification of location of the end-effectors has simple 
kinematics equations, yielding the joint parameters 
relationship [12]. 
 To accomplish this paper we created a database taking 
reading of numerous people. The data from HMCD, which 
would be simple, and reliable to capture the angle change of 
various joints of the body. Reason of using fuzzy logic is 
obvious and we can heuristically conclude that the gait pattern 
varies on parameters viz. sex, body weight (heavy or light) 
and state of mind (relaxed or nervous; happy or sad etc.). It 
can be argued that simple distance measure will never work 
precisely while on the other hand fuzzy classifier wills few 
notches higher. 
We aim to create a GAIT cycle for various forms of 
locomotion like simple walking upgraded to brisk walking and 
then to running and other forms such as stair climbing. For 
normal and healthy persons the GAIT cycle generated can be 
used as an input to realize a biped [1]. 
 
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULT 
 
 The research shows some useful behavior of human being 
towards push recovery. The experimentally result using in 
house development proved that humans have preference for 
left and right legs analogous to left and right handedness[14]. 
The strategy is different for left hander or right handed 
persons. The knee joint is very active in maintaining balance 
towards push. It gives great insight to develop a reactive 
controller for a bipedal humanoid robot, to make robot 
model different from the architecture of plain robot, which 
robot is helpful in many real world interface like swimming 
robot or a flying robot. So, It is desirable to use the mass 
instead of the density so we set density =-1 mass =0.5 density 
in kilogram/cubic meter and mass in kilometer. When we 
specified density it ignored mass. The below mentioned table 
gives details about the various parameters used in our model.

 Denavit–Hartenberg parameter or D-H parameter are well 
known and highly useful concept in robotics. With the help of 
D-H parameter, next link of the manipulator can fully 
described with respect to the previous link [20][21]. 
 Right ankle and left ankle of left handed person shows 
little involvement in balancing. This experiment shows a very 
different result that one side of human body is more active 
during push recovery i.e. for left hander person, his right leg 
joints are more active in push recovery pattern and vice versa. 
Vital role has played by knee in balancing.  
 
ANALYSIS 
 
 The research exhibit the useful behavior for further 
development of push recovery based model of human being 
towards push recovery. The data collected by HCMD and 
research done in our previous paper[3] concluded that left 
handed or right handed persons use different strategy for push 
recovery and specially the knee joint is too active during 
maintain the balance against push. Our developed model 
controller led for subsequently development of biped reactive 
controller. 
 
PERFORMANCE MEASURES 
While dynamic models used a LIPM, which assume a 
point mass biped with fixed CoM value. We validate our 
method on the HOAP-2[2], which have 25 DoF with 
multibody mass better flexibility to avoid obstacle and less 
singularity issue as compared to LIPM model

IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DISCUSSION 
 In direction of push recovery which is highly complex 
and high dimensional problem the model described is a big 
step in the direction of generalization of robot architecture. 
Our simulation model is in accordance with the development 
of real robot in the same direction keeping HOAP-2 in mind, a 
biped model humanoid model can be developed having 
properties such as mass, density, inertia, able to learn from 
examples, for which we can define physics and in turn it can 
exhibit some capability for generalization beyond the sample 
data. Also it has universal approximation property parameters 
and measurement similar or close to HOAP-2[1]. This was 
done so as to lower down the complexity of the problem and 
make it easy to understand the governing reason for push 
recovery. The model developed in this direction is biped 
which has legs equipped with number of servos, enough to 
make it follow ankle and hip strategy as well. The data was 
gathered and the fuzzy module was developed which showed 
result with high accuracy. This model and the data gathered 
can help in further research in this direction of push recovery. 
To add learning to the model and make it fast in response and 
remove computation a hierarchal fuzzy model was developed. 
This is very close to that of actual synthetic data. We have 
concluded that bipedal push recovery is based on learning and 
controlled reactions and if we want to impart effective push 
recovery to a humanoid robot, we will have to understand that 
it is a software engineering problem rather than hardware 
controlled problem as envisioned earlier. This will lead to 
reach on consensus that push recovery is software problem.
