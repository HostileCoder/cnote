Abstract  
Recent studies and workshops have stressed the fundamental 
importance of providing harmonised health and social care 
services that meet the extended needs of the individual, taking 
into account diversity in need, preferences, ability and sup-
 port. For a real caring society, the notion of "information 
sharing" becomes clearly crucial when communication and 
interaction in health care is needed. This paper revisits recent 
funded projects undertaken by our team, in view of the so-
 called coordination of planned activities for elderly/disabled 
care and independent living support. Three development pil-
 lars are taken under consideration herein, namely, affective 
exergaming services for seniors/disabled, social media and 
the semantic web. Outputs from a multitude of projects are 
then used to provide evidence of how issues recently encoun-
 tered under the so-called blue line dimensions are tackled; 
these are technological interoperability, semantic integration, 
modern interfaces, people needs/expectations and societal 
incentives. As the latter synthesize a con-temporary puzzle of 
personalised health care approach, this paper provides an 
innovative perspective of interlinking developments and out-
 puts of research in view of improving healthcare.

Introduction 
Cognitive, communication and social impairments are 
amongst the largest problems of today’s European healthcare 
and economic development. For instance, autism and demen-
 tia are among the most significant deficiencies that are associ-
 ated with hospitalization, extensive and continuous treatment 
and/or lack of daily functionality and independent living. 
European demographic surveys reveal that the number of 
people  aged 65+ has nearly doubled during the last four dec-
 ades and it is expected that Europe will have around 173 mil-
 lion people aged 65+ by 2050. Realising the critical issues of 
our ageing society, different initiatives have developed com-
 prehensive RTD roadmaps for active ageing by consolidating 
and extending existing and emerging technological solutions 
in close interaction with relevant stakeholders [1]. There has 
also been a growing focus on the value of ehealth and telecare 
interventions for improving quality and cost-effectiveness of 
care for people with long term complex health and social care 
needs [2]. 
Moreover, in a report on the EC Public On-line Consultation, 
conducted back in 2008 [3], "Health and Social Care Systems" 
as well as "the Ageing Population" were rated as among the 
few most important societal challenges requiring ICT innova-
 tion over the next decade. In the same report, "Web based 
services" were identified as the main business applications to 
drive ICT developments in the next decade, while the notion 
of integration of subcomponents and systems also seemed to 
be a key aspect for future ICT developments likewise.  
Undoubtedly, we live in a world in change. The following 
table summarises some of the past and present facts for the 
ageing society and its web technology support.

Fusion of technologies at 
user end / integration 
 
In such an environment, the obvious challenge for any gov-
 ernment has been to propose ways to extend provision of 
health and social care services for citizens, while at the same 
time as improving their quality and reducing costs. Large 
scale randomised controlled trials of tele-care and e-health 
have recently demonstrated that these technologies can sup-
 port quality and efficiency improvements if they are imple-
 mented properly [4]. On another front, designers are using 
inclusive design techniques to find out what older and dis-
 abled people find difficult when using current products and 
services and to incorporate those findings into social services 
[4]. 
But according to the Ancient Greek theory of mankind, hu-
 mans consist of the triptych "Body, mind, soul/psyche". So, 
how can contemporary technology and research exploit this 978-1-4799-3163-7/13/$31.00 2013 IEEE
fact? Is there a scope for introducing the notion of emotions 
into the design of social services? Can they play a role and 
prove to be useful in ageing or in assistance to disabled? 
Recent reviews on affective medicine [5] and the growing 
research interest worldwide for this new domain provide an 
affirmative answer to the aforementioned questions.  
In tandem to the above views, the society has witnessed the 
explosion of social media and their inevitable incorporation in 
health care and social support. However, the use of all kinds 
of technological artefacts for electronic and mobile health,  
and personal health systems generate an ever increasing 
amount of data, recently denoted as "big data" [6]. 
So, the aim of this paper is threefold. First to re-examine re-
 cent research outputs and current research developments un-
 dertaken in funded projects;  second, to collate the developed 
therein enabling e-services along the notions of emotion, 
physical and cognitive training, gaming, social networking 
and the semantic web services; finally, through this multitude 
of projects, to synthesise a vision of sustainably serving the 
citizen through the use of ICT, thereby supporting the key role 
and prospects of personalised health (pHealth). 
Materials and Methods 
A recent analysis by the Casemix project, has identified five 
(5) major issues, which are key factors when considering a 
holistic approach of the delivery of health and social services. 
Jacob Hofdijk used the notion of "a Hug and a Kiss" to illus-
 trate that the systems in question are mainly to improve the 
quality of life [7]. The notion of "blue line dimensions" was 
coined in to model this approach. These dimensions are tech-
 nological interoperability, semantic integration, modern man-
 machine interfaces, people needs and expectations and socie-
 tal incentives. So in essence, the concept of the Blue Line, 
was engineered to link the different dimensions created and 
provide the base to link people, systems and approaches [7]. 
Horizontally  to this concept, three technological development 
pillars are taken under consideration herein, namely: (i) affec-
 tive exergaming, that is emotion and affect fused with physi-
 cal and cognitive exercises through computer games; (ii) so-
 cial services for seniors and disabled through social media; 
(iii) the integrative and interoperable role of semantic web 
services in exploiting the richness of big data. 
This paper uses the following funded projects, listed in Table 
2, as a vehicle in touching upon the aforementioned dimen-
 sions.

The analysing view 
Pillar 1: emotions and affective exergaming 
We have previously touched upon the role of emotions. Affec-
 tive computing (AC) is the scientific discipline that is con-
 cerned with emotional interactions performed with and 
through computers. It is defined as “computing that relates to, 
arises from, or deliberately influences emotions” [5]. Perhaps 
one of the most significant issues within AC is the underlying 
relation between emotions and human health, both mental and 
physical. Moreover, as human emotions may be expressed and 
communicated through various channels like text (contextual 
information), audio (speech), face expressions and body ges-
 tures (visual) and internal physiological changes (blood pres-
 sure, skin sweating, etc.), one could effectively use such 
communication tips and realize contemporary interactions 
through multimodal sensing and expressing of affect. It is 
generally true, that if something makes people happier, they 
would like to use it frequently; at the end of the day, it is good 
for human health. It also true that regular physical exercise, 
significantly improves physical functioning of individuals at 
any age. Engagement of elderly individuals in regular physical 
exercise programs has demonstrated improvement in cogni-
 tion and psychological well being among other benefits [8]. 
So, if one has robust scientific methods and tools to study 
emotions (detect, recognise, classify, identify its origin etc) 
(Table 2: Affection and Sthenos projects), then it is easy to 
explore different ways of exploiting the emotions; for exam-
 ple, one can imagine its subsequent fusion with systems like 
avatars (Table 2: Affection and Autism projects) and devices 
like physical activity equipment (Table 2: LLM project) or 
interactive Smart TVs or slate tablet PCs (Table 2:  USEFIL 
project).  
For the activities to become even more attractive to users pro-
 jects like the above use the notion of digital gaming, support-
 ing user experience informed by principles of gameplay, nar-
 ratives and simulations. A serious game is most widely under-
 stood as a digital game having purposes other than pure enter-
 tainment (sometimes called edutainment=education + enter-
 tainment) [9] or  exergaming= (physical) exercise + gaming 
[10]. 
Pillar 2: social services for seniors and disabled through 
social media 
A social network constitutes the collection of interpersonal 
ties that individuals maintain and that provide them with sev-
 eral possible benefits, such as the augmentation of self-
 concept, fostering of feelings of belonging, and the provision 
of cognitive guidance and tangible assistance in fulfilling the 
tasks of daily living. Online social networks currently lie at 
the research frontier with respect to older persons and usabil-
 ity. There are technical barriers to entry that must be levelled. 
Beyond that, specifically with respect to social networks, 
there is a cultural context that needs to be understood. 
Experience provides evidence that the main reason for the 
older or a disabled person’s exclusion so far from ICT ad-
 vances, is associated with the fact that they do not or cannot 
use to the same degree IT and communication technologies 
which are used by mainly younger or healthier/normal people. 
This is mostly attributed to the fact that these tools are too 
difficult to be managed or understood by older persons. Coin-
 ing in the aspect of ease of use interfaces in the form of avatar 
agents (Table 2: Affection project) or a sensible level of emo-
 tional touch (Table 2: LLM project) has been found to be 
beneficial. 
Moreover, it is true that virtual communities (i.e. groups of 
people connecting via web) are beginning to form in relation 
to disease or illness. However, a classification of online social 
networks is still missing with respect to the functional-
 ity/service available via these individual social media tools. 
Interventions or studies that attempt to extrapolate how differ-
 ent ‘affordances’ offered by various social networks are asso-
 ciated with specific needs of groups of patients are still miss-
 ing. This affects the mode of interaction as well. By utilising 
social media as a health management tool one could reflect on 
this and improve the approach (Table 2: Sthenos and LLM 
projects). 
Moreover, other forms of social media and particularly se-
 mantic wikis have been lately been used by different online 
health related professional and educational services. Semantic 
wikis further extent the usual notion of a collaborative Wiki 
with the incorporation of “semantic technologies” (i.e. the 
notion of exploiting and enriching existing navigational links 
with symbols that describe their meaning, that is semantic 
annotations [11]. Capitalising on such technologies, recent 
research endeavours have allowed for and presented contem-
 porary tools designed to aid doctors and patients in identifying 
interventions commonly associated with specific attributes 
(e.g. diagnoses) [12] (Table 2: mEducator project). In that 
way activities needed to implement and document care as 
provided to the individual patient may be entered into a portal 
through a “Wikipedia-like” web-based tool that provides 
methods for organizing thought processes for clinical decision 
making, or delivery of individualized patient care, or simply 
support of the carer through guidelines (Table 2: DISCOVER 
project). 
Pillar 3: semantic web services in exploiting the richness of 
big data 
"The era of Big Data has begun" [6]. A multitude of scientists 
from different disciplines are clamoring for access to the mas-
 sive quantities of information produced by and about people, 
things and their interactions. The semantic web was developed 
to provide a “smart” solution to this end, that is for linking 
and searching data and resources. This takes place through the 
connection of structured data that arise either from an applica-
 tion or from primary descriptions of data, i.e. Linked data 
[13]. Emphasis has now been shifted on the connectivity of 
knowledge, information and resources. Resources from differ-
 ent repositories may now be connected and related. To this 
extend the mEducator project (Table 2) [14, 15] has upgraded 
resource sharing, retrieving, re-using and repurposing to the 
era of semantic web while maintaining key assets of the social 
web/media. In this way, like in the case of semantic wikis, 
web resources may be linked with information from non-
 pharmaceutical healthcare interventions (for seniors or dis-
 abled) or even with more formal/clinical interventions/trials or 
even drug trial results. By maintaining collaborative technolo-
 gies (web 2.0) in the loop (see Table 2: mEducator), the user 
sharing experience is fostered. 
Figure 1 is attempting a collating view of Table 2, as well as, 
the afore-described details, in an illustrative and synthesising 
manner. For instance, the obtained background scientific 
knowledge on emotions (Affection, Sthenos, Autism) may be 
exploited for the integration of emotion or person 
status/situation detection (USEFIL); and result into a sug-
 gested feedback or prompting for an intervention (LLM); en-
 riched with knowledge and experience sharing in terms of 
educational semantic material (mEducator) will end up at a 
library of experience for caregivers where the caregivers will 
act both as the educator and as the learner/student 
(DISCOVER).

The synthesising view 
The newly released eHealth Action Plan aims at addressing 
and removing different barriers for the applicability of e-
 health and tele-care. It clarifies the policy domain and outlines 
the vision for eHealth in Europe, in line with the objectives of 
the Europe 2020 Strategy and the Digital Agenda for Europe 
[15], and addresses the following operational objectives: 
-achieving wider interoperability of eHealth services; 
-supporting research, development and innovation in 
eHealth and wellbeing to address the lack of availabil-
 ity of user-friendly tools and services; 
-facilitating uptake and ensuring wider deployment; 
-promoting policy dialogue and international cooperation 
on eHealth at global level. 
Although there is one-to-one correspondence between the 
above mentioned Blue Line dimensions, there is an obvious 
overlap. But let us attempt to itemise these dimensions again 
in Table 3 and link them with the advances, developments or 
impacts the afore described projects have brought about.

For instance, there is common belief regarding the beneficial 
role of physical activity on mood, anxiety and depression. 
Several studies have attempted to improve the socioemotional 
skills of older people and to neutralize their negative feelings 
through physical activity intervention programs. Despite re-
 porting an antidepressive and anxiolytic effect, they failed to 
come to a definitive conclusion due to the lack of a concrete 
methodological framework. In the LLM project, the system 
design followed but also the pilots deployment has provided 
evidence for a wide acceptance of the system by its senior 
users, as well as, effective end results against depression and 
its associated cognitive decline [16, 17, 18]. The following 
figure is attempting to illustrate the above synthesis by linking 
the blue line dimensions to the various projects we have been 
involved.

Discussion 
This visionary paper has attempted to demonstrate that inno-
 vative and contemporary technological approaches (the three 
pillars used in the analysisng view) may give rise to systems 
that serve the society in the prescribed (by formal policy 
documents) way. 
It is obvious that a closer look at the societal needs and a more 
detailed analysis of the problem under consideration is going 
to provide the scientific community with many key recipes for 
the future advancement of personalised health systems. 
Key issues to consider every time, and in view of the above 
descriptions are the following though:  
1. There exists great tools /enabling technologies available, 
but are they marketable, sustainable and effective ? 
2. How does one filter which of them is suitable for his/her 
needs? This is where one needs scientifically sound method-
 ologies to measure the impact in all different aspects (health, 
business, technically etc) 
3. It is usually the proper combination of technolo-
 gies/interventions that may be innovative but also more effec-
 tive. The excellent results produced by the LLM project ex-
 ample provides a useful example and tutorial on how one 
could adjust effectiveness measures according to needs. 
4. pHealth systems need to create measurable added values 
but also synergies between different disciplines. 
5. There is always a dilemma between innovation versus sim-
 plicity and/or application of known systems. Moreover, there 
is always a fight or dilemma of doing business or science (es-
 pecially in recent recession and financial crisis times). Key 
solution to this end though seems to be (stemming from our 
current from experience) that exploitation of scientific and 
technological innovation may lead to proper (and sustainable) 
business solutions which may in turn fight against recession 
effectively. 
Finally, if some advice is to be drawn on how to address the 
issue of the incentive based policy changes that are much 
needed nowadays to redesign health and social care provision 
and really emphasise it person-centered prospects, then that 
could be first based on a holistic approach. That is, one needs 
to consider contemporary tools to initiate the process of 
change (paradigm changes);  in addition one should also fol-
 low technology changes (continuously) with transparent user 
utterances, while allowing for easy access, flexible (customis-
 able) and easy to use systems. last but not least, a key concept 
remains the constant need to evaluate extensively. To this end, 
trials/interventions with measured outcomes would provide 
the necessary evidence much needed for pHealth systems to-
 day.
