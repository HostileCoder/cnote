 EXTENDED ABSTRACT
 Abstract—Complex networks arise everywhere. Online social
 networks are famous complex networks examples due to (a) revo-
 lutionizing the way people interact on the Web, and (b) permitting
 in practice the study of interdisciplinary theories that arise from
 human activities, at both micro (i.e. individual) and macro (i.e.
 community) level. The vast scale (Big–data) of online human
 interactions impose certain challenges, such as scalable indexing
 and efficient retrieval of social data, which are by their nature
 intertwined in multiple dimensions. In our research we focus
 on modeling such multidimensional data, mining their intra and
 inter dependencies to uncover hidden structures and emergent
 knowledge. In particular, we examine informal interactions at
 the workplace. Through extensive empirical analysis of corporate
 communication logs we study users’ communication behavioral
 patterns, dynamics and characteristics, statistical properties and
 complex correlations between social and topical structures. Our
 modeling and analysis are not limited to enterprise social data,
 but are extensible and applicable to other domains, offering a
 unified framework of complex network modeling and analysis,
 accurately modeling multiple symmetric or asymmetric, explicit
 and hidden interaction channels between people.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 Social Networks have revolutionized the way people com-
 municate and interact, while serving as a platform for informa-
 tion dissemination, content organization and search, expertize
 identification and influence. The popularity of online social
 networks like Facebook and Twitter has given researchers
 access to massive quantities of data for analysis. Such datasets
 provide an opportunity to study the characteristics of social
 networks in order to understand the dynamics of individual
 and group behavior, underlying structures, and local and global
 patterns that govern information flow.
 Most of the analysis performed thus far has mainly focused
 on publicly available online social networks [1]. However,
 microblogging capabilities have been adopted by the enter-
 prise as well [2], [3]. Contrary to online social networks,
 microblogging services for enterprises are primarily designed
 to support employees in connecting and learning about each
 other through personal and professional sharing [4]. Organiza-
 tions hosting internal social networking sites can benefit from
 mining employees’ informal interaction logs, as well as from
 identifying reliable indicators of expertise.
 Enterprise collaboration platforms mainly focus on the busi-
 ness perspective and therefore their content revolves around
 their main business and work culture, work practices, and
 everyday problems. Being more focused and less noisy than
 online social networks, enterprise microblogging platforms
 offer unique opportunities for identifying experts, as well
 as studying and understanding the processes of knowledge
 generation and sharing. Studying collaboration media that are
 internally used by organizations can result in multiple benefits
 both for employees and corporations. Employees can “get
 help or advice, reach opportunities beyond those available
 through existing ties, discover new routes for potential career
 development, learn about new projects and assets they can
 reuse and leverage, connect with subject matter experts and
 other influential people within the organization, cultivate their
 organizational social capital, and ultimately grow their repu-
 tation and influence within the organization” [5]. Similarly,
 enterprises can benefit from increased productivity due to
 reduced time spend in team building and knowledge propaga-
 tion, as well as expertise mining and preservation [6]. Further,
 enterprises can utilize the results stemming out of informal
 interactions analysis, to better understand how their employees
 work together to complete tasks or produce innovative ideas,
 reveal trends, identify experts and influential individuals, so
 as to evaluate and adjust their management strategy, team
 building and resource allocation policies.
 Enterprises have been mainly relying on e-mail traffic to
 share information among coworkers [7]. Analysis of enter-
 prise communication networks [8], [9] has broadened our
 understanding of information flow in the enterprise. Media

 like SharePoint and Office Communicator are heavily utilized
 as part of question-answering and problem solving processes,
 while Active Directory provides a formal structure for employ-
 ees to comprehend and navigate through the organizational
 hierarchy, accommodating their need to identify potential
 collaborators, research teams and business units around the
 globe, as well as to discover “interesting” projects that others
 are currently working on. The wealth of information available
 in the context of enterprises however, is not limited to formal
 interactions and silos containing structured data. Informal
 interactions through corporate micro-blogging services span
 organizational charts, facilitating knowledge generation in the
 form of direct problem solutions or links to external sources.
 Knowledge in such cases may not have been formally modeled
 and captured until a specific question is being asked and an
 expert answer is provided.
 II. HOLISTIC MODELING OF COMPLEX NETWORKS
 We have proposed a formal model [6], [10] that abstracts
 the semantics of informal communication into an integrated,
 context aware, time sensitive, multi-dimensional space, en-
 abling the correlation of seemingly different domains so as
 to investigate them in conjunction. We introduce a novel
 social graph representation, shown in Figure 1, which not
 only contains social links between users but also maintains
 integrated information regarding users dynamically changing
 interests and activities, throughout collaboration tools used in
 working environments.
 a) Social Layer: captures users contextual and temporal
 interactions. Nodes represent users and arcs represent explicit
 relationships (links) between them. The social layer records
 user relationships from multiple collaboration platforms: e-
 mail correspondence, chat networks, blogging activity, shared
 bookmarks and common ratings. An edge between users is
 defined by the context under which it is created and has an
 associated timestamp. A user u may be connected to user v
 under multiple contexts (e.g sending e-mails and social status
 updates) in multiple time instances.
 In order to process enterprise communication effectively, it
 is imperative to establish a comprehensive model of contexts,
 and semantic links to structure them [10]. Various interpreta-
 tions of captured scalar, hierarchical, and nominal, temporal,
 or spatial data that differ with context (e.g. point of view) can
 provide different insights or views (i.e. dimensions). Figure
 2 shows various contexts that can be utilized for advanced
 analysis of corporate communication data.
 b) Content Layer: captures published content from mul-
 tiple sources, including but not limited to resources shared
 by users (e.g. photos or videos), bookmarked and/or tagged
 resources (e.g. URLs), users’ generated content (e.g. status
 updates in Facebook), e-mails, chat messages, and blog posts.
 c) Semantic Layer: contains meta-information about
 content, and can be broken into several constituting layers,
 each containing different metadata about content. This layer
 may include, but is not limited to, domain ontologies, vocab-
 ularies, and folksonomies and taxonomies, external sources
 of formal knowledge, and linked open data. We use semantic
 information providers and annotation enablers, such as Open-
 Calais, AlchemyAPI, and Evri, WordNet, and Freebase, for
 text analysis and annotation, entity identification and topic
 discovery. Linked Open Data (LOD) can further be exploited
 to link to external knowledge repositories.
 Our novel model entangles structural information from
 multiple heterogeneous networks, with arbitrary, multimodal
 attributes originating from various information sources, and
 content that has been generated under specific context [6],
 [10]. Knowledge is discovered, captured and inferred based
 on such complex information. Our social algebraic operators
 [6] facilitate dimensional and contextual analysis and mining
 of social data from multiple views and perspectives, enabling
 deep exploration and understanding of both explicit and im-
 plicit interactions and relations.
 Our model is not limited to enterprise social data, but is ex-
 tensible and applicable to other domains, accurately modeling
 multiple symmetric or asymmetric, explicit and hidden inter-
 action channels between people. It can capture multimodal,
 heterogeneous attributes of users and their interrelations, and
 facilitate complex mining and analysis of evolving, multidi-
 mensional, intertwined, auxiliary social networking data.
 III. APPLICATIONS
 The full power of our model can be perceived at the context
 of corporate networks that emerge from explicit formal rela-
 tions as well as informal collaboration. Towards this direction,
 we have instantiated our model with exogenous to the social
 network information, i.e. (a) formal organizational structure,
 and (b) hints about employees’ interests and expertise areas
 using latent topic descriptors, learned from enterprise com-
 munication logs [10]. This facilitates multimodal, semantic,
 temporal and adaptive analysis of roles along and across
 dimensions, and permits micro–macro analysis [10].
 We demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework on
 a large scale dataset of corporate communication logs from
 a Fortune 500 company [10]. Our dataset includes 9, 855
 577
Figure 2. Contexts in informal interactions at the workplace
 unique users, and 15, 200 messages with explicit reply links
 to other messages, over a time span of 1.5 years. The dataset
 contains users activity (message exchanges) and interactions
 (e.g. comment/reply, tagging), but lacks explicit social rela-
 tionships (followee/follower) between users. We compensate
 the lack of social relationships with a snapshot of the formal
 organizational hierarchy of users.
 A. Enterprise Wisdom Captured Socially
 Our model facilitates integration, capturing, search, and
 retrieval of dynamic and constantly evolving enterprise knowl-
 edge captured from informal interactions. In fact, our model
 enhances collaborative data analysis in the enterprise, re-
 vealing latent topics, expertise, and interests, both at micro
 (single user) and macro (e.g department or business unit)
 level. We have evaluated our system in the tasks of (a) expert
 identification, (b) community detection, (c) trends mining, and
 (d) communication dynamics [10].
 1) Multidimensional Expert Identification: Employees’
 level of expertise may vary from topic to topic and from
 medium to medium. One might share innovative ideas and con-
 tribute to discussions through emails, but not in microblogging
 sites. We differentiate expertise according to communication
 channels, time and content type.
 2) Context–Sensitive Community Detection: Analysis of
 employees’ interactions reveals hidden dynamics at various
 granularities. The topic–restrained ego–network of different
 users may reveal patterns that vary across topics, whereas by
 clustering users with similar interests, it is possible to detect
 virtual communities (macro level).
 3) Mining of Trends: Discovery of trending topics is a
 typical application in social network analytics. Typically,
 trending topics are identified for a single communication
 channel for single network. Such analysis may be inefficient
 for an enterprise. Instead, analysis at the macro level can prove
 to be more useful in discovering, for instance, trending topics
 and significant contributors in various collaboration platforms,
 different departments and organizational positions.
 4) Communication Dynamics: Organizational hierarchy is
 static, and dated, whereas communication may create “short-
 cuts”, i.e. collaboration that spans hierarchical levels when
 seeking for help, or offering guidance, etc. Studying communi-
 cation may reveal hidden organizational dynamics. Our system
 enables analysis of information propagation across the rigid
 structure of formal organizational charts, providing insights
 on the collaboration processes that employees devise in order
 to tackle everyday problems and find solutions.
 B. Predicting Intention of Communication in Social Media
 Social media do not discriminate between users’ relation-
 ships. Acquaintance relationships invariably model broad rela-
 tionship types, ranging from trusted friends to total strangers.
 In reality, relationships fall everywhere along this spectrum
 and are asymmetric with respect to users. Tie strength is
 a complicated problem, that depends not only on structural
 features, but also on user roles in a relationship (e.g. family
 or friends), context (e.g. time, location) and content (e.g.
 topic). Further, two users may concurrently maintain multiple
 relationships (e.g. being friends and coworkers simultane-
 ously). In this sense, tie type and strength is time-varying, and
 situational, asymmetric and multidimensional. More complex
 relationships can further been defined, once node types are
 expanded to include not only people, but entities of any kind.
 Our work bridges this gap by integrating various modalities
 of social interactions and considering such aspects holistically,
 entangling or disentangling dimensions (i.e. perspectives)
 when appropriate, in order to perform accurate recommen-
 dations. In particular, we examined communication process in
 social media and the factors that affect this process. We have
 evaluated our approach, examining its performance in the task
 of accurate and timely prediction of intention of communi-
 cation initiation between users in a corporate microblogging
 service, which resembles Twitter [11]. Our accurate predictor
 is able to achieve high performance with increasing statisti-
 cal evidence, leveraging local structural proximity and user–
 generated content.

IV. RELATED WORK
 Online social network have been well studied, leading to
 a vast literature around this area [12]. Here, we focus on
 prior work that is mostly related to collaboration media at
 the workplace. [3] discussed various challenges and solutions
 in conducting social network analysis in the enterprise. [2]
 provided a systematic examination of adoption and usage
 of microblogging in a corporation environment, emphasizing
 on the perceived benefits of corporate microblogging and
 barriers to adoption. [13] explored the factors that influence
 people’s tendency to share personal information in Twitter,
 and examined microblogging’s potential impact on informal
 communication at work. [4] investigated workplace relation-
 ships built between coworkers using microblogging services
 and determined interaction patterns that signal personal ver-
 sus professional closeness between colleagues. [14] and [15]
 examined users microblogging behavior at work as a function
 of their motivation.
 V. RESEARCH STATUS
 Building models of complex networks, understanding their
 rich properties, hidden structures and dimensional interdepen-
 dencies are not trivial tasks. Our work has made several steps
 towards these broad directions. We now have a robust model
 that integrates multiple networks, each with rich properties
 and hidden dynamics, facilitating multimodal analysis of time–
 varying, complex social networking data [6], [10]. We also
 have a better understanding of microblogging behavior in
 the workplace, and the effect of formal structure in informal
 communication [11], [16]. Last but not least, we have better
 models for prediction and recommendation tasks in social
 media [11].
 However many research problems still remain open, and
 offer prominent future directions. Information diffusion and
 propagation of topics has been well studied in online social
 media (e.g. [17]), but remains unexplored in the context of
 workplace. Communication dynamics at the workplace are
 relatively unknown. Knowledge capturing in the form of best
 practices has not been automatically achieved. We plan to
 address these issues in our future work, while at the same
 time incorporating qualitative studies and expanding our work
 to multiple datasets.
