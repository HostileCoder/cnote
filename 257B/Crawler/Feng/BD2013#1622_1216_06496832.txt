Abstract— A “high level”, deductive-reasoning-based 
(“holistic”), approach is aimed at the direct analysis of the 
behavior of a system as a whole, rather than with an attempt to 
understand the system’s behavior by conducting first a “low 
level”, inductive-reasoning-based, analysis of the behavior and 
the contributions of the system’s elements. The holistic view on 
treatment is widely accepted in medical practice, and “holistic 
health” concept upholds that all the aspects of people's needs 
(psychological, physical or social), should be seen as a whole, 
and that a disease is caused by the combined effect of physical, 
emotional, spiritual, social and environmental imbalances.  
Holistic reasoning is applied in our analysis to model the 
behavior of engineering products (“species”) subjected to 
various economic, marketing, and reliability “health” factors. 
Vehicular products (cars, aircraft, boats, etc.), e.g., might be 
still robust enough, but could be out-of-date, or functionally 
obsolete, or their further use might be viewed as unjustifiably 
expensive. High-level-performance functions (HLPF) are the 
essential feature of the approach. HLPFs are, in effect, 
“signatures” of the “species” of interest. The HLPFs describe, 
in a “holistic”, and certainly in a probabilistic, way, numerous 
complex multi-dependable relations among the representatives 
of the “species” under consideration.  glyph1197umerous inter-related 
“stresses”, both actual (“physical”) and nonphysical, which 
affect the probabilistic predictions are inherently being taken 
into account by the HLPFs. There is no need, and might even 
be counter-productive, to conduct tedious, time- and labor-
 consuming experimentations and to invest significant amount 
of time and resources to accumulate “representative statistics” 
to predict the governing probabilistic characteristics of the 
system behavior, such as, e.g., life expectancy of a particular 
type of products.  
 “Species” of military aircraft, commercial aircraft and private 
cars have been chosen in our analysis as illustrations of the 
fruitfulness of the "holistic" approach. The obtained data show 
that both commercial “species” exhibit similar “survival 
dynamics” in compare with those of the military species of 
aircraft: lifetime distributions were found to be Weibull 
distributions for all “species” however for commercial vehicles, 
the shape parameters were a little higher than 2, and scale 
parameters were 19.8 years (aircraft) and 21.7 (cars) whereas 
for military aircraft, the shape parameters were much higher 
and the mean time to failure much longer. The difference 
between the lifetime characteristics of the “species” can be 
attributed to the differences in the social, operational, 
economic and safety-and-reliability requirements and 
constraints. The obtained information can be used to make 
tentative predictions for the most likely trends in the given 
field of vehicular technology.  The following major conclusions 
can be drawn from our analysis:  
• The suggested concept based on the use of HLPFs reflects 
the current state and the general perceptions in the given field 
of engineering, including aerospace technologies, and allows 
for all the inherent and induced factors to be taken into 
account: any type of failures, usage profiles, economic factors, 
environmental conditions, etc. The concept requires only very 
general input data for the entire population. There is no need 
for the less available information about individual articles.  
• Failure modes are not restricted to the physical type of 
failures and include economic, cultural or social effects. All 
possible causes, which might lead to making a decision to 
terminate the use of a particular type of product, are 
considered by the HLPF. The failure modes do not need to be 
differentiated and their characteristics do not need to be 
identified, addressed and determined. 
• Practical, easy-to-use and physically meaningful algorithms 
and techniques have been developed for the description of the 
age distribution of the population (“species’) at the beginning 
of the time period of interest, and recommendations for the 
most adequate HLPF model are provided. Obtaining HLPF for 
competing species may serve as an effective and a powerful tool 
for comparing different trademarks, manufacturers, usage 
environments or even different technologies.  
• The suggested holistic approach expands the scope of the art 
and science of reliability engineering and considers, in a very 
general, yet practically useful, way, the philosophies and 
attitudes of both the manufacturers and customers 
communities. The approach can be viewed as a constituent 
part of rather general and broad areas of probabilistic design 
for reliability (PDfR) concept and probabilistic risk 
analysis/management.

1. Iglyph1197TRODUCTIOglyph1197 
Holism (from Greek ???? holos, a word meaning all, whole, 
entire, total) is the idea that “high level” properties of a 
system (“species”), whether physical, technical, biological, 
chemical, social, economic, mental, statistical, etc., cannot 
be satisfactorily determined, explained and described in an 
inductive fashion, i.e., from an “inductive” reasoning that 
makes generalizations based on the behavior of the 
“individuals” (component parts). In contrast, a deductive 
(“holistic”) reasoning should be employed to determine how 
the particular system of interest behaves and performs.  It is 
the system as a whole that determines the way how its parts 
behave or perform, not the other way around. The term 
“holism” was coined in 1926 by Jan Smuts [1], South 
African and British statesman, military leader and 
philosopher. Smuts’ concept regards objects, both animate 
and inanimate, as "wholes" and not merely as assemblages 
of elements or parts, and makes the existence of "wholes" a 
fundamental feature of the world.  In the analysis that 
follows we apply general principles of holistic reasoning to 
the reliability engineering field and treat a particular area of 
engineering, from the reliability standpoint, on a broad 
holistic basis of the performance of engineering objects 
(“species”). 
The structure of the currently used reliability function aimed 
at the assessment of the life-time of a particular population 
implies, to be statistically meaningful, extensive life 
duration measurements for a large sample size (see, e.g., 
[2,3]). In many cases there is indeed a need to use an 
“inductive” approach, when there is an objective to 
understand the roles and contributions of different factors of 
different nature to the general distribution of interest. This is 
the case, e.g., when one wants to understand the role of 
different underlying factors affecting a design, a 
phenomenon or a mission, with consideration of the roles of 
both technical and human factors (see, e.g., [4,5]).  There 
are, however, numerous situations, which, by their very 
nature, are just the opposite of such a situation. For high-
 level predictions and applications, thorough consideration of 
numerous impacts of a large number of stresses of different 
significance and of different nature might not be a must at 
all. Only the bottom-line, the holistic, effect is important, 
and it is this type of systems and situations that are 
addressed in the present article.  As a possible future work 
we are considering using the above two opposite approaches 
in particular reliability engineering related problems to 
assess how these two approaches could be combined and 
how they might interact. 
In the present analysis we suggest an approach aimed at the 
evaluation of the performance (reliability) of a population, 
not necessarily a homogeneous one.  It might be OK to 
combine “apples” with “oranges”, as long as one is 
interested in the bottom-line impact of the behavior of this 
group of “fruits” or perhaps in even fruits or even plants in 
general. We combine all these objects as “species”.  These 
“species” could be, e.g., consumer products (cell phones, 
cars, personal computers), or software products, or even 
service packages, provided that the relevant data are 
obtainable and manageable. Our down-to-earth objective is 
to indicate some practically useful applications of the 
holistic approach and to suggest a way for obtaining the 
HLPF from the most general available data for a certain 
population. Particularly, the suggested approach can be used 
to compare the role of the human factor (the society impact) 
in different countries (US, Europe, Japan, Mexico, etc.) on 
the life expectancy of particular consumer products or the 
group of products. For the automotive market, for instance, 
one will most likely establish that the longest car life would 
be in Mexico and the shortest perhaps in the US, and that 
the life expectancy for the car population increases during 
the time of a recession and decreases during the periods of 
economic growth. One can also establish, using our high-
 level approach that the lifespan of a product increases with 
an increase in the design maturity and/or in a situation, 
when long term reliability of a product is predicted and 
assured. At the system-of-systems level our HLPF based 
model becomes a unique high-level measurement tool for 
lifecycle management (see section 8). We intend to pursue 
this application in our future work.  
An obvious challenge has to do with the recognition and 
identification of different kinds of stresses that may cause 
the seeming, but economically meaningful, “death” of a 
product, as well as with the definition of what should be 
considered as the end of a product's life. For instance, many 
still functionally good and undamaged old computer 
accessories that, in effect, did not fail, neither functionally 
nor mechanically, are often abandoned in old drawers. 
These might be considered as failed products because of the 
appearance of more attractive innovative technical solutions. 
Economic prosperity may encourage diminution of used 
cars in favor of new ones, or because of high cost of 
gasoline. The threat of high pollution might force consumers 
to trade in their still good conventional cars for hybrid ones. 
Various healthcare related considerations and issues might 
lead to the avoidance of, or, on the contrary, to the 
preference in, use of a particular product. The imaginary or 
actual consequences of electromagnetic radiation, e.g., may 
adversely affect the cellular phone market. As far as mass-
 production of today’s consumer products is concerned, the 
human factor (human preference, ergonomics, fashion, etc.) 
often plays a decisive role in many nonphysical 
socioeconomic, cultural and social failure modes and 
mechanisms and their interdependencies. On the other hand, 
more complex products require a more general, birds-eye, 
holistic, view, assessment of their dependable life 
characteristics in terms of market survivability. This 
statement is true not only for some particular models or 
products, but for a wide collection of related applications 
and designs – “species”. This is certainly true for consumer 
products (household devices, laptop computers, cars, etc.), 
but might be also true for more complex products of public 
use (spaceships, satellites, aircrafts, ships, buildings, 
bridges, etc.), whose failure, unlike in many consumer 
products, is a catastrophe and might be even associated with 
the loss of human lives. These products are often so costly 
and are produced in such large quantities that their cost-
 effectiveness is critical [6]. This situation might also be 
 
3  
valid for some military objects that are produced in large 
quantities (shells, warheads, torpedoes, etc.). We believe 
that our holistic approach is particularly suitable for modern 
consumer markets that do not lend themselves to traditional 
survivability assessments: software products, insurance 
contracts, or various service packages.  
Note that in the analysis below we use the term failure as an 
end-of-life event. Any repairable random malfunction 
during the item’s lifetime is ignored.  Hence, time-to-failure 
(TTF) means the time to the out-of-service condition. 
 
2. BASIC COglyph1197CEPT 
The reliability function R(t1,t2) is defined in the reliability 
theory [2,3] as the probability to fulfill a certain mission 
during the time period [t1,t2] under prescribed, specified, 
predetermined conditions. This function is obtained from 
the probability density function f(t) for the TTF:  
2
 1
 1 2( , ) 1 ( )
 t
 t
 R t t f t dt= ? ∫                          (1) 
In the absence of prior knowledge, the function f(t) is 
obtained using various goodness-of-fit criteria (Pierson’s, 
Kolmogorov’s, etc.) from the histogram of failure times for 
the given population. The data are being collected 
throughout an experiment either at actual or at accelerated 
test conditions [6].  Most of the existing procedures aimed at 
the evaluation of the adequate reliability function suffer 
from a number of drawbacks. Examples are significant time 
and labor consumption, substantial cost ineffectiveness, the 
need for using oversimplified assumptions about the 
acceleration factors, inaccurate specifications of the 
environmental and operating conditions, unsubstantiated 
modeling of the combined action of various stresses and of 
the unclear intervening uncertainties, difficulties in the 
interpretation of the accelerated test information to make it 
applicable to the final products at the system level, etc. 
Despite these well known drawbacks, the existing statistical 
methods and techniques (accelerated tests, sequential tests, 
Bayesian statistics, etc.) are being widely used to 
experimentally process, evaluate and accumulate life 
statistics for various populations and products [3,7,8].  
Unlike the existing approaches, which require, and are 
based on, the statistics of the TTF for individual products in 
order to obtain the information reflected by the formula (1), 
our approach is based on the existing and even routinely 
recorded and, hence, well-known and readily available 
information (data) for the population of the species of 
interest. These data could be based on the periodic 
registration of the total amount of active objects and the 
delivery rate of the “newly born” ones. Such input data 
automatically contain the aggregated information on the 
cumulative influences of all kinds of governing factors, 
maintenance policies, usage profiles, age distributions and a 
variety of human factors during the time period of interest. 
From this perspective, the development and use of our 
holistic approach require neither appreciable financial 
investments, nor significant testing time, nor any stringent 
identification of the particular use conditions.  This 
approach is based on real life observations and on usually 
readily available information with no prior assumptions that 
might be rather shaky (questionable). 
For all the species, the amount of active items at the current 
moment of time is just the very consequence of the already 
occurred births and deaths of individuals. The general 
underlying analytical expression is sought in the form that 
relates the quantity of the active species' population glyph817(T) at 
the moment of time T to the delivery rate  ( )n t? of the new 
items ( t T≤ ). The balance equation for this situation could 
be accepted in the form of the homogeneous Fredholm 
integral equation of the first kind (see, for instance, [9-10]): 
( ) ( ) ( , )
 T
 glyph817 T n t R T t dt
 ?∞
 = ?∫ ?                        (2) 
Here the function R(T,t) plays the role of a suitable filter 
that reflects the evolutionary properties of the population: 
the survivability of an individual is determined by both the 
moment of delivery t and the current time T.  
Although the reliability (performance) parameters may 
evolve over time, it is natural to assume that these 
parameters are steady-state, as long as the test-time interval 
is sufficiently short. In that case, the reliability 
(performance) depends only on the time interval, so that 
R(T,t)= R(T- t). A major disruption, if any, in the reliability 
(performance) process should be viewed as a revolutionary, 
catastrophic, one. This could occur, e.g., if some disruptive 
technologies are introduced or because of some other 
unpredictable, intervening, “black swan” type, events. If this 
happens, newly born individuals no longer belong to, and 
should not be viewed as representatives of, the same 
species: probabilistic analyses might not be applicable to 
unforeseen, extraordinary, outstanding, unique situations. 
Thus, the basic equation (2) could be reduced in our analysis 
to the equation:  
( ) ( ) ( )
 T
 glyph817 T n t R T t dt
 ?∞
 = ? ?∫ ?                    (3) 
where R(T-t) is the reliability function. This function is 
applicable to each individual, from the moment t of its 
delivery onward. Note that recovering R(T-t) from the 
equation (3), i.e. obtaining an analytical or even a numerical 
solution to an inverse problem [11], is not trivial at all. 
Since the equation (3) is, in effect, a convolution, by 
applying Fourier transform to this equation one could obtain 
an algebraically convenient solution. This solution, 
however, is mostly suitable for theoretical analytic modeling 
rather than for practical discrete and noisy applications.  
The structure of the equation (3) assumes that the needed 
data are available since the very beginning of history, i.e., 
for the entire time of interest. In a situation when the records 
commence at an arbitrary time threshold T0, the equation (3) 
should be replaced by the equation:

function within the time interval [T0, T] and is applicable to 
the individuals delivered at the moment t prior to T0, 
provided that these individuals are still active at the time T0 
[2]. The last term in (4) resembles (3).  
Without any loss in the generality of the analysis, one can 
assume T0=0, so that, for glyph8170=glyph817(T0) and 0T t? = ? ,the

This equation can be used to recover the reliability function.  
The discussion that follows suggests a mathematical 
(modeling) recipe for solving the problem by using the 
following sequence of procedures:  
(1)  Start with simplified scenarios, in which glyph817(T0) has no  
distribution of age, introducing the applicability of a 
numerical solution; 
(2) Continue with more general cases using effective age 
groups as a tentative description of the unknown age 
distribution of the initial population at T0;  
(3) Conclude with particular case studies based on, and 
designed for, actual field data.   
In the special case, when all the glyph8170 are supplied at T=0, the 
age distribution is a delta-function f(?)=?(0), and the 
equation (5) yields:

The simplest illustration of how the suggested approach 
works can be obtained by using (6) under the assumption of 
constant delivery rate ( )n t? =C. The example I in appendix 
A demonstrates a non trivial analytical solution.  
The above case is revisited using the MathCAD program for 
a sequence of numerical data (as opposite to analytical) of 
consecutive time units. One vector, denoted by n, contains 
the delivery rates. Another vector, denoted by R, refers to 
the reliability function. The relationship (6) results in the 
following series glyph817i – the vector of the population quantity, 
which contains the convolution n R?

It was arbitrarily decided to let ni be added in complete at 
the end of the time unit i, where the index i indicates the 
upper edges of the time units along the time axis.  
Expanding the series glyph817i we obtain the following set of

'D' is a squared matrix with a triangular shaped content.  
Figure 1 shows that glyph817i of the numeric equation (7) perfectly 
conjugates glyph817(Ti) of the analytical solution (10A) for the case 
addressed in the Example I in Appendix A. In this case ni 
are constant for every i and the reliability function is 
exponential as per (A9).  
In this implementation, the initial population is chosen to be 
glyph8170=10,000, the constant delivery rate is C=400 and the 
failure rate is ?=1/84 [1/time unit].

4. BEglyph1197CHMARK FOR THE glyph1197UMERICAL SOLUTIOglyph1197 
Periodic quantitative database is likely to be recorded in a 
discrete manner. Hence, executing the recovery of the 
sought reliability function requires that the equation (7) is 
rewritten as:

                                   (8) 
After obtaining the solution to the inverse problem, the 
continuous reliability function could then be adjusted to the 
calculated vector by one of many well-known methods. 
The relationship (8) is the general governing model. It is 
necessary therefore to evaluate its accuracy by considering 
the associated error along the time axis. As before, the 
reliability function and the delivery rate function are 
assumed to be known. Every newly delivered article is 
assigned with a random value of life duration, for which the 
relevant following time units are flagged. The amount of 
active articles is then accumulated at each time index. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2 – The simulation of population dynamics.  
 
The process is illustrated by the diagram in Figure 2. The 
thin arrow, originated in a newly delivered article, 
represents the random life duration and the gray dot flags an 
active state. By repeatedly executing the process, one can 
find the statistical properties of the accumulated population 
vector. 
For the demonstration of the benchmarking process, a 
reliability function of the Weibull distribution form is 
chosen:  
( )( ) exp TR T ???? ?= ? ?? ?                              (9) 
Here ? and ? are the scale and shape parameters, 
respectively. The discrete reliability vector is given by 
( )i iR R T=  with, here, ?=230 and ?=2. 
A MathCAD simulation is used for executing the process 
shown in Figure 2 for 100 cycles attaining 100 different 
population vectors.  
The example II in appendix A shows some satisfying 
statistical behavior of the population balance applied by the 
numerical solution (7), encouraging an inquiry for the 
validity of (8).  
One hundred reliability vectors were calculated by the 
equation (8) for each vector of simulated random population 
vectors. Utilizing the least squares method, two parameters 
Weibull reliability function was fitted to each vector, 
deriving a pair of parameters. Figure 3 presents the 
statistical dispersion measures for the pairs of the Weibull 
parameters ? and ?. The standard deviations found for this 
case were ?? = 0.25 and ?? = 0.009 respectively and the 
averages are well around the given values. 
In the following discussions, the uncertainties of the 
parameters are defined by U? = ±2?? and U? = ±2?? with 
standard deviations derived from similar simulations for the 
relevant parameters and sample size.

5. EFFECTIVE AGE-GROUP DISTRIBUTIOglyph1197 OF glyph8170 
The previous examples deal with the cases when either the 
input data are available since the emergence of the species 
or the entire initial population glyph8170 delivered at T0. However, 
in case glyph8170 has some age distribution, its size and pattern 
may have an impact on the solution of the equation (5). Any 
individual having aging properties, which has survived until 
the moment T0, has already been around for some time and, 
therefore, must not be considered as a newly born one. 
Furthermore, the duration of that impact, before fading out, 
is determined by the parameters of the unknown reliability 
function. To determine this function is the goal of this quest.  
The problem is that no information prior to the moment T0 is 
available, including the age distribution at that very 
moment. The following procedure can be used to reconstruct 
the R(T) function in accordance with the equation (5): 
(1) The unknown age distribution f(?) can be roughly 
represented on the basis of a small number of groups, 
each having an effective age and a weighing 
coefficient. 
(2) A suitable reliability function should be presumed using 
some reasonable generalizations and assumptions.  
(3) An iterative process should be carried out obtaining the 
solution for the equation (5), while adapting all the 
parameters to have the calculated population values 
agree with the field output data.  
(4) A truncating criterion should be used to control the 
iteration while minimizing the output error.

This process enables one to obtain a more sophisticated 
solution to the inverse problem which ends with the 
resulting desired function R(T). 
According to the four-step procedure outlined above, the 
unknown age distribution of the current glyph8170 may be separated 
to, e.g., two major effective age groups: young and old. This 
rough description provides the model with tuning 
parameters, while the actual distribution is not of any 
interest. This two-group pseudo-age-distribution comprises 
of three parameters, where g(young) and g(old) are the effective 
ages accordingly, measured in time units, and ? is the 
weighing coefficient which determines the relative size of 
the two age groups out of the total glyph8170, when 0 1?≤ ≤ .  
As before, a numerical description of the equation (5) is 
advisable for actual use:

Here, the index i is an integer where 1 i≤  and Ri =R(Ti). 
Let us assume now that the unknown reliability function is 
distributed in accordance with the Weibull law as per (9). 
This assumption is believed to be realistic for most species 
of products, performing flexible fitting abilities for the aging 
phenomenon. 
Hence, all the unknown parameters are set with guess values 
and introduced to the equation, then iteratively adapted until 
the deviation of glyph817i from the actual data is minimized. 
Generally, such a multidimensional minimization problem 
requires a solution by a computer algorithm (see, for 
instance, [12]). However, as in our case studies, a manual 
search for the optimal values necessitated no lengthy 
procedure to obtain satisfying convergence.  
The objective of the Example III in appendix A is to 
demonstrate the practicality, and the necessity, of the two-
 group effective age distribution. Thus, the parameters of the 
Weibull reliability function were set to those predetermined 
in the Example II, allowing the iterative manipulation of the 
remaining parameters only: g(young), g(old) and ?. These values 
are actually meaningless but successfully representing the 
unknown real distribution. 
Note that, in reality, the reliability function is also unknown.  
Evidently, the impact of wrongfully treating glyph8170 is not 
negligible, and clearly influences the deviation from the true 
model, although fading out after all the articles of glyph8170 have 
"died". In practice, the number of groups of effective age is 
preferred to be the smallest, reducing the number of the 
unknown parameters. We believe that for most species of 
consumer products, one-group or two-group effective age 
distributions are sufficient to represent the true, however 
unknown, age distribution of the population glyph8170 at T0. 
 
6. CASE STUDIES – IMPLEMEglyph1197TATIOglyph1197  
OF REAL FIELD DATA 
Practical cases, where R(T) as well as the age distribution of 
glyph8170 are both unknown, are discussed in this section. Example 
IV in the appendix A presents some considerations and 
regularizations for the implementation of field data by the 
previously outlined procedure. 
The following case studies deal with different species of 
transportation technologies: military aircraft, commercial 
aircraft and private vehicles. The data is freely available on 
the internet. Those enable the comparison of the HLPFs 
given different statistical characteristics, i.e., sample size, 
balance dynamics and noise. Needless to note: the more 
statistics, the more accurate the model. For instance, a 
sample without "death" of articles throughout the recorded 
time period is not solvable.  
Entry of new articles occurs at birth in all of the following 
case studies; other data bases with entries at different ages 
compel a slight modification of (5). 
As an example to how the model refers to the actual data of 
the delivery rate and the population balance, Figure 4 
exhibits monthly records of the dynamics of case study V.

Case study V- Private Vehicles 
Source: Official records of the Central Bureau of Statistics 
of the State of Israel, http://www.cbs.gov.il/reader .  
The species of interest was selected to be all Private 
Vehicles in Israel. This case study was chosen for its 
dynamic data base covering 84 monthly records from 
January 2001 to December 2007. 
We may assume that, in this case, the delivery reports 
always precede actual vehicles' appearance on road. This 
time spread was modeled by an integral filter prior to the 
analysis. Furthermore, from the engineering perspective, 
vehicles necessarily exhibit an aging phenomenon for their 
mechanics, and from the human perspective, users do not 
seem to be apathetic to the year of production. Therefore, 
private vehicles may be assumed to be physically aging as 
well as perceived as such. Hence the above justifies the 
reliability model of the Weibull form. 
In conclusion of this case study, the best Weibull model for 
the reliability function of private vehicles in Israel was 
found to have the parameters: 
  ? =260.3± 1.3 [months];  ?=2.03± 0.06

excellent match derived by the model.

The results of the case studies express some expected aging 
behavior (i.e., ?>1) which all vehicles undergo; an older 
vehicle is more likely to end its service life for any possible 
reason, however the cases differ significantly. We may point 
out some reasoning for the different results, having in mind 
that all the case studies deal with different species of 
transportation technologies.  
The most interesting finding is the clustering of two groups 
of characteristics – military aircrafts vs. commercial 
vehicles. The shape parameter ? of all three species of

military aircraft is relatively high between 7.5 and 16 and 
the MTTF ranges from 40 to 50 years whereas for both jets 
and private cars it is approximately ?≈2 for the shape 
parameter and around 17 to 19 years for MTTF.    
The relatively large ? and long MTTF of military aircrafts 
may indicate that the decision for grounding such items is 
motivated by a minority of dominant "stresses" which 
assemble a policy of the USAF leadership. These could be 
influenced by the cycle and high cost of new generation 
development programs or the response to worldwide 
challenges and threats. Technical malfunctions are 
overcome and rarely cause the fatal grounding of a military 
aircraft. On the other hand, the survivability of commercial 
vehicles responses to an entirely different set of "stresses"; 
the variety and multiplicity of users, of use conditions and 
maintenance policies and of economic conditions increase 
the statistical variance of the TTF and hence decreases the 
shape parameter. Still, it seems the physical aging of 
commercial vehicles has merely a partial effect in the air as 
well as on ground since technically they could be 
maintained active for decades longer than their MTTF. 
This clustering is unique for the HLPF approach and it is 
particularly emphasized by the fact that the two species of 
commercial vehicles represent distinct technologies.     
 
7. DISCUSSIOglyph1197: THE HOLISTIC APPROACH OF 
THE RELIABILITY FUglyph1197CTIOglyph1197 
The reliability functions found in the case studies contain all 
mutual product-consumer relations. They express the 
probability that a vehicle of a given species remains in 
service within a time period disregarding any specific 
conditions. Certainly, apart from inherent physical 
properties, a large variety of unpredictable environmental 
conditions, as well as human, economic or operational 
factors, determine, in combine, the time of which a private 
vehicle ends its term of service or a fleet of old bombers is 
replaced almost in a sudden. For example, private vehicles 
may be stricken out from records following total loss 
accidents, thefts or unprofitability of maintenance; fighters 
may retire in favor of newer ones in accordance with enemy 
technology development or evolving strategic missions; 
commercial jets are influenced by new safety demands or 
recession-motivated cuts as was in 2008.  
Beyond the idea of snapshot description of the species' 
survivability characteristics, one should notice their 
inconstant nature. Some of the factors dynamically change 
over time: the percentage of ingredients of the species; 
military operational threats; avionic safety demands; trends 
in the struggle against car thefts and accidents; economic 
considerations etc. The notion (concept) of the continuous 
change in the model’s parameters over time reveals another 
important practical application of our approach. It is in the 
field of lifecycle management for species of any nature.  
One can assume a particular product line or a particular 
technology that undergoes the well known five stages of its 
lifetime: introduction, growth, maturity, saturation and 
obsolesce. Application of our model would shed important 
and practically useful light on the performance of the 
species of interest. For instance, deep into growth stage the 
model may predict long term survivability, or at the end of 
the maturity age it might simply apply a lower chance to 
survive or at the saturation stage one would notice the 
predicted decline in the population of the species tangible 
representatives towards its inexistence.  Tracking the trends 
in the model’s parameters may serve as beneficial 
continuous feedback information for lifecycle management. 
 
8. COglyph1197CLUSIOglyph1197S 
The following major conclusions could be drawn from the 
carried out analysis:  
• The reliability function is the outcome of a high-level 
inference allowing all inherent and induced factors to be 
taken into account: any type of failure modes, usage 
profiles, environmental conditions, etc.  
• Failure modes are no longer restricted to the physical type 
and include socioeconomic, cultural or social modes. All 
possible causes which may dictate the termination of a 
service period are made acceptable. The failure modes do 
not need to be differentiated and their characteristics do 
not need to be determined. 
• High-level analysis requires only general data of the 
entire population and renounces the need for the less 
achievable information of individual articles. 
• The ascription of related products to a certain species, no 
doubt, must bear some common sense. However, the 
definition of a species is flexible. Therefore, species 
become the object for which comparisons of service life 
characteristics are attained. 
• In addition, practical techniques were developed for the 
description of the unknown age distribution of the 
population at the beginning of the test period and a 
procedure was demonstrated for the conclusion of the 
most adequate model of the reliability function.  
Obtaining such reliability functions for competing species 
may serve as a powerful tool for the comparison between 
trademarks, manufacturers, usage environments or even 
technologies. The holistic approach to the reliability of 
species offers a wider interpretation for the reliability 
theory. The life characteristics, derived by this approach, are 
those describing the combined system of both products and 
users.

 Mathematical tools and examples
 Example I 
Constant delivery rate – analytical solution 
The simplest illustration of how the suggested approach 
works can be obtained under an assumption that the delivery 
rate is constant ( )n t? =C. With T t? = ? , the equation (6) 
becomes:

By analogy with the expectation value from the Quantum 
Mechanics [10], a conjugate transpose (Hermitian 
transpose) operator is employed to determine the quantities 
in both parts of the equation (A1). This yields the following:

The equation (A2) could be verified for the case of an 
exponential reliability function with the failure rate ?: 
( ) exp( )R T T?= ? ?                                   (A3) 
Introducing (9A) into the equation (7A), we obtain:  
0( ) exp( ) (1 exp( ))
 Cglyph817 T glyph817 T T? ??= ? ? ? + ? ? ? ?
       (A4) 
When introducing this expression back into the equation 
(A2), the appropriate exponential reliability function (A3) 
could be easily restored.  
 
 
 
Example II 
Statistical properties of population dynamics 
The delivery rate changes in time with ni representing the 
amount delivered at the end of the time unit i (Figure A.1a). 
In this case, the initial population is glyph8170=0. The expected 
population vector for the predetermined weibull reliability 
function, using equation (7), is shown in Figure A.1b. One 
hundred random vectors were calculated according to the 
simulation process explained in Figure 2. For each time 
index, the average and standard deviation are calculated. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure A.1 – Statistical properties of the model  
 
 
The obtained results indicate that the mean error is on the 
order of 4 magnitudes smaller than the expected population 
(Figure A.1d).  
Also, the standard deviation is smaller than the reasonable 
upper boundary – the square root of the expected total 
quantity (Figure A.1c) and the signal-to-noise ratio 
stabilizes around 900 (Figure A.1e).

Example III 
Two effective age-group distribution for glyph8170  
This example refers to the same input data as in the Example 
II. The input data are the vectors of the delivery rate (Figure 
A.1a) and the population balance (Figure A.1b). In this case, 
however, the experimentalist possesses only the data from 
an arbitrary moment Ti onward, and i=300. Therefore, the 
preceding glyph817300 becomes the current glyph8170 and in general, 
300 iglyph817 + barb2right iglyph817  and 300 in + barb2right in . Note that the current glyph8170 
obviously has some kind of age distribution; hence, the 
unknown true distribution must be effectively represented to 
allow obtaining a generalized numerical solution to the 
equation (5). 
Figure A.2 demonstrates the comparison between two cases. 
Figure A.2a illustrates the deviation of the calculated 
population from the actual data, having glyph8170 been wrongfully 
considered to have no age distribution by the formula (7), 
whereas Figure A.2b shows the consequence of an iterative 
process based on two-group age distribution leading to the 
convergence of glyph817i ,as per (10), with the actual population 
data. The expected output, i.e. the true data, is drawn by the 
solid line in Figure A.2. This is identical to Figure A.1b but 
differently scaled on the vertical axis. 
The iteration process has been terminated using a visual 
criterion concluding the following values of the parameters: 
g(young)=35 [time units], g(old)=194 [time units] and ?=0.505. 
These values are actually meaningless but successfully 
representing the unknown real distribution.

the articles of glyph8170  have "died", in this example around T800. 
 
 
 
 
Example IV 
The implementation of real field data  
The next example, aiming at the development of actual 
species' reliability model, follows a route for implementing 
the generic procedure outlined in section 5.  
Nonetheless, useful regularizations are yet possible prior to 
the analysis. Introducing the data to the equation (8) while 
purposely addressing the exponential reliability model 
enables the calculation of the species' MTTF. This 
characteristic is expected to approximately maintain its 
value in the final model for dynamic, mass-statistics, data 
base. This yields the scale parameter [time units] – 
hereinafter the MTTF, which For the Weibull distribution is 
expressed by ( )1 1/MTTF ? ?= ?? +  with ? as the Gamma 
function. This MTTF sets a valid guess value and either of 
the parameters ? or ? alone should be fitted. For less 
dynamic data bases, particularly with no new deliveries as 
in the case study II, the average population age at T0, if 
available, may be used as a guess value for the effective age.  
Following the procedure, the first phase of the analysis 
hence assumes that the age distribution of glyph8170 is expressed 
by a one-group effective age. The mathematical description 
of this case is the same as in the formula (10) with 0? = . 
The iterative progress in fitting the model is achieved by 
means of a relevant penalty (loss) function. In our analysis 
the root mean square error (RMSE) was implemented. It 
measures the gap between the model of the equation (10) 
and the field actual population. The RMSE formula is:

 ( ) ( ) . .

Where parrowrightnosp  is a vector of all model parameters as per (10) and 
(M-d.f.) is the number of readings minus degrees of freedom 
– the model's number of parameters.  
Truncating criterions are also required. They may vary 
subject to the quality of the data, the required accuracy or 
the stage of the procedure. For instance, in case that one-
 group effective age model is far from converging, visual 
criterion may suffice to move forward to the next phase 
using two-group effective age model. In other cases, the 
procedure may be truncated if the improvement in RMSE 
value is negligible. In case the input data are most dynamic, 
as in the case study V, the RMSE may be compared to an 
acceptable evaluation of the input fluctuations; If it is 
smaller than the input standard deviation, the procedure 
must be truncated since any seeming improvement is a mere 
illusion. 
The last step of the procedure examines whether the 
consequential model of the reliability function, with one-
 group effective age, is satisfactory according to the 
truncating criterion. It may still be possible, however not 
necessary, to further modify the model by commencing a 
second phase with two-group effective age distribution. At 
this phase, the whole procedure is performed all over again, 
with more unknown parameters as per (10).
