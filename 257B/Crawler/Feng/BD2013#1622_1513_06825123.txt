 Abstract—The increase in the amount of digital data trans-
 ferred between contents Servers and Clients in a network causes
 problems created by congestion when downloading big web
 files, streaming media, etc. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)
 are introduced to overcome such problems by redirecting the
 Clients request to the nearest Server. However, as the number
 of people accessing Internet increases rapidly, the performance
 of CDN is reduced, resulting in network congestion at times.
 To solve these problems, we propose an architecture in which
 a new management method is employed to redirect the Clients
 request using a content-based Router called the Service-oriented
 Router (SoR). This method is more effective than the currently
 implemented, traditional DNS-based request redirection (RR).
 The SoR is a special router that can perform a deep packet
 inspection of the packet streams. Our experiments were based
 on analytical modeling as well as test bed experiments, and they
 confirmed that the response time in the Router-based RR was
 less than that in the DNS-based RR by 23.3%. In addition, our
 test bed experiments showed that the RTT in the Router-based
 RR is less than that in the DNS-based RR by 7.7%.
 I. INTRODUCTION
 Efficient content delivery over the web has become an
 important element in improving web performance. Against
 this background, content distribution networks (CDNs) have
 been proposed to maximize bandwidth, improve accessibility,
 and maintain correctness through content replication. CDNs
 enable the distribution of content to cache servers located
 close to users, thus realizing fast, reliable applications and web
 services for the users [1]. CDNs are used by internet service
 providers to deliver static as well as dynamic contents, which
 are replicated on distributed servers [2], [3]. When a specific
 web page, file, or program is requested by a user, the closest
 server is dynamically determined for reducing the load on the
 main server. This distribution method optimizes the throughput
 of content delivery to the user.
 CDNs provide numerous benefits for cacheable content: low
 delivery cost, high quality of experience for end-users, and
 high robustness of delivery. Hence, they are frequently used
 for large-scale content delivery. In particular, the adoption
 of CDNs helps realize performance improvement from the
 following viewpoints: (i) overall system throughput, that is
 the average number of requests served in a time unit, and
 (ii) response time or round trip time (RTT) for the client,
 measured from the time of sending a request [4]. Finding
 the nearest surrogate server for a particular CDN client is
 the most important factor in minimizing a clients response
 time. Connection performance largely depends on the request
 redirection (RR) management, of which domain name system
 (DNS)-based management and URL rewriting [5] are the most
 popular ones, used by the CDN provider. CDN provider such
 as Akamai [6] use DNS-based management to redirect requests
 from clients to their nearest server.
 In this paper, we propose a method in which service-
 oriented router (SoR) functions are implemented in a next-
 generation CDN for effective and efficient RR management;
 SoR is a Router that can interact with and provide services
 to clients by using a defined application program interface
 (API) [7]. SoR can observe traffic data streams, inspect packet
 payloads as well as packet headers, and store the designated
 data in the associated database. To store data in a database,
 the SoR uses a new query language, named service-oriented
 switch and router query language (SSRQL) [7]. The proposed
 SSRQL can provide up to 10 Gbps throughput. Application
 programmers can access the database by using SSRQL queries
 to develop new services in the SoR, such as capturing content
 in a website [8] and routing redirection for a CDN [9] or for
 artificial intelligent systems such as Bayesian networks [10].
 In addition, an SoR monitors packet streams and conducts
 deep packet inspection of payloads as well as headers [7], and
 re-routes packets based on their payloads [9], [11].
 II. RESEARCH BACKGROUND
 A. Minimizing response time in a CDN
 A CDN delivers contents to users from those edges of the
 network that are close to the client. A CDN realizes a smaller
 response time compared to that when the content is obtained
 from the origin server, as shown in Figure 1. In the example
 given in the figure, if a client contacts the nearest server, which
 is server 1 to retrieve content (via path 3), the response time
 is shorter than that if the content is obtained from the origin
 server (via path 1). Furthermore, network usage is reduced and
 optimized on path 3 because backbone traffic is reduced.
 Regarding to reduction of the response time for a particular
 client, three factors have to be considered: (i) network delay,
 (ii) server processing time, and (iii) traffic density. Our re-
 search is mainly aimed at minimizing the above three factors
 by employing a new model of redirection management.
 B. DNS
 The DNS is a distributed database containing records of a
 name-to-address mapping system by caching resource records
 at intermediate name servers. Each record has a time-to-live

(TTL) value that controls how long it will be cached, and gen-
 erally, TTL values are set to one day [5]. Although small TTL
 values allow fine-grained load balancing and rapid response to
 the changes in the server or network load, the clients have to
 contact the authoritative name server for every name resolution
 request. This phenomenon increases web access latency and
 may cause congestion. Akamai uses FreeFlow DNS, which is
 an improved version of a DNS for realizing high-performance,
 fault-tolerant web content delivery service [12]. FreeFlow uses
 three layers of DNS resolving, namely root-level, high-level
 (HL), and low-level (LL) DNS.

 nearest server to reduce response time.
 The disadvantages of DNS-based redirection method are
 that users need to obtain the IP address before contacting
 servers and that DNS traffic consumes some of the bandwidth
 from the internet backbone, thus increasing the time taken to
 initiate a connection. Thus, the response time for accessing
 the content in a DNS-based scheme. Therefore, minimizing
 the amount of DNS traffic in a network will result in effective
 load for the next-generation network.
 C. SoR
 The SoR is a special router that snoops and captures data
 streams passively and stores data in a high-speed database.
 SoR can be designed to communicate with other SoRs and
 share information such as link status, link condition, and sur-
 rogate server information. NEGI, a software-based simulator,
 was created by implementing an SoR with basic functionalities
 [13]. NEGI is a packet analyzer that analyzes data streams and
 compares packet streams by using regular expressions. The
 SoR can also analyze packet streams and store the frequency
 value of accessing websites and pdf files [8]. Such information
 can be used to provide recommendations for web sites and
 pdf files for clients. Experimental results show that an SoR-
 based CDN environment has advantages over DNS-based
 implementation from the viewpoints of connection initiation
 and content migration [9].
 III. MODELING MANAGEMENT OF REQUEST
 REDIRECTION
 A. Router-based redirection
 We designed and modeled a Router-based RR management
 in a CDN using an SoR as the core-router [14]. Here, for a
 given workload, we derive an expression of redirection prob-
 ability to minimize the response time. Next, we compute the
 average response time, taking into account the service rate and
 network delay. Then, we perform a systematic performance
 analysis to estimate the optimal redirection probability ??.

 Fig. 2. Design architecture of CDN with router-based routing redirection
 using an SoR as router
 Figure 2 illustrates the system model for a CDN with
 router-based RR. Requests from clients i reach a server j
 through an SoR i. We modeled the system as an M/M/1
 queuing model, where the arrival of requests from a client
 can be modeled as a Poisson process with rate ? and an
 exponential distribution service time µ. We consider ?ij as
 the redirection probability; E[T ], the expected response time;
 and D, a one-way network delay between nodes. For the
 general case of a system of n SoRs, and n surrogate servers,
 A = {?11, ..., ?ij , ..., ?nn} denotes a matrix of RR probability
 from the SoR to surrogate servers E[T ] = {T1, ..., Tn} as
 the vector of system response time in a particular node, and
 D = {d12, ..., dij , ..., dnm} denotes the matrix of network
 delay from node i to j. Furthermore, ? = {?1, ..., ?n} denotes
 the vector of total input of request arrival rates into the system,
 and L = {?1, ..., ?n} denotes the vector of packet arrival rates
 at a particular node, XSoR = {µSoR1 , ..., µSoRn } as the service
 rate in SoR; XSS = {µSS1 , ..., µSSn } denotes the service rate
 in surrogate server.
 Theorem 1. The expected response time of the system with
 Router-based RR depicted in figure 2 using a redirection
 probability A is given by the following equation:
 E[T ] = 1

 Proof. The total response time is composed of three factors:
 (i) the response time in SoR, (ii) the response time in surrogate
 server, and (iii) the network delay from the client to the
 SoR and from the SoR to the surrogate server. The design

architecture shown in Figure 1 is considered as a queuing
 network with tandem servers. Refer to Jackson Networks with
 M/M/1 queuing model [15]. if N be the average number of
 customers, the response time of the system is given by the
 following equation:
 T = N∑n
 i=1 ?i
 =
 (
 1∑n
 i=1 ?i
 ) n∑

 (2)
 As shown in Figure 1, the systems consist of SoRs and
 surrogate servers. Let client i sent a packet request with arrival
 rate ?i. The arrival rate in an SoR is equal to the arrival
 rate from the client i, ?SoRi = ?i. Let ?ij be the redirection
 probability from SoR i to surrogate j. Since every packet is
 analyzed in an SoR and then redirected to the nearest surrogate
 server, the arrival rate in the surrogate server depends on the
 probability ?ij such that ?SSi = ?ij?i. Next, consider a one-
 way latency when transmitting a packet request from client i
 to SoR i by dSoRi and from SoR i to surrogate server j by
 dSSij . Equation (2) can be rewritten as follows:
 Ti =

 (3)
 In Eq. (3), let d be represent vector Di for i = 1, ..., n ,
 and let T be vector Ti for i = 1, ..., n to get Eq. (1).
 From Eq. (1), we can compute the optimal redirection
 probability to minimize the response time over all requests.
 In particular, let A? = {?11, ..., ?ij , ..., ?nn} denote the
 matrix of optimal request redirection probability. The optimal
 redirection probability A is obtained by differentiating Eq. (1)
 such that ∂∂x (E[T ]) = 0. The optimal redirection probability
 A? can be used to predict the average response time for the
 system with router-based redirection, where the equation is
 given as follows:

 B. DNS-based redirection
 In order to compare the performance of the router-based
 RR, we consider a CDN architecture with DNS-based RR, as
 depicted in Figure 3. Requests come from cluster client i to
 server j through router i. We model the system as an M/M/1
 queuing model with CDN architecture with DNS-based RR
 management. We consider a redirection algorithm in which
 a request is redirected to the nearest surrogate server with
 probability ?ij . We use parameters similar to those used in
 router-based RR management for all equations; in addition, the
 parameters XR = {µR1 , ..., µRn } is considered as the service
 rate in the router. XDNS = {µDNS1 , ..., µDNSn } is considered
 as the service rate in the DNS server.
 Theorem 2. The expected response time of the system using
 with DNS-based RR depicted in figure 3, using redirection
 probability A is given by the following equation:
 E[T ] = 1

 (5)
 Proof. Unlike in the case considered in theorem 1, the total
 response time here is composed of 4 factors: (i) the response
 time of the router, (ii) the response time of the DNS, (iii) the
 response time of the surrogate server (SS), and (iv) the network
 delays from the client to the router, from the router to the
 DNS and from the router to the surrogate server. The design
 architecture, depicted in Figure 3, is considered as a queuing
 network with tandem servers with the M/M/1 queuing model.
 The system consists of routers, DNS servers, and surrogate
 servers.

 Fig. 3. Design architecture of CDN with dns-based routing redirection
 As in the proof for theorem 1, and referring to the case of
 a Jackson network with M/M/1 queuing networks, let client i
 send a packet request with arrival rate ?i. As shown in Figure
 3, the arrival rate at the router is equal to the arrival rate from
 client i, ?Ri = ?i. Let ?i be the redirection probability from
 router i to DNS server and ?ij , the redirection probability from
 router i to surrogate j. The DNS server provides the address
 of the appropriate destination so that the client’s request is
 redirected to the best server. According to this condition, the
 arrival rate at the surrogate server depends on the probability
 ?ij such that ?SSi = ?ij?i.
 Next, we consider a one-way latency when transmitting the
 packet request from client i to router i with dRi delay, from
 router i to DNS server with dDNS delay, and from router i to
 surrogate server j with dSSij delay. The system response time
 is given as follows:

 Here, d is of Dij for i, j = 1, ..., n; T , vector Ti for i =
 1, ..., n, thus yielding equation (5).
 From Eq. (5), we can compute the optimal redirection prob-
 ability to minimize the response time over all requests. The
 optimal redirection probability A is obtained by differentiating
 Eq. (6) such that ∂∂x (E[T ]) = 0. The optimal redirection
 probability A? can be used to predict the average response
 time for the system with DNS-based redirection, where the

 C. Numerical Analysis
 In this section, we will show that the router-based RR
 management can reduce the total response time. We consider a
 system comprising a client, an SoR, and two surrogate servers
 with identical service rates. Furthermore, di is the network
 delay between the client and SoR, and dSSij , between the SoR
 and surrogate server. We set ?SS1 > ?SS2 and dSS11 > dSS12 so
 that ?11 = 0, and set ?? = ??12. The system response time is
 computed based on theorem 1:
 T = 1

 (8)
 where ?11 +?12 = 1. We refer to the term ?? as the optimal
 redirection probability from the SoR to the default surrogate
 server, and (1???) is the redirection probability to the other
 surrogate server. Then, according to the Eq.(8), the response
 time of the router-based redirection system is as given below:

 The response time of the DNS-based RR is calculated in the
 same manner as described above. Consider a system, as shown
 in Figure 3, comprising a client, router, and DNS server, and
 two surrogate servers. The response time of the DNS-based
 RR management is given below:

 IV. PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND RESULT
 We conducted simulations to verify the aforementioned the-
 orems with default values as follows: the average of network
 delay between client (d1) and router or SoR (measured in one
 cluster of PlanetLab network testing environment) was 0.5 ms.
 The average delay from the SoR/router to the DNS server (d2)
 is 30 ms, as per DNS records [5].

The network delay between the SoR/router to the surrogate
 server (d3) is 36 ms [2] with a packet size of 1500 bytes.
 Service rates for the router and DNS-server are 10 Mbps each;
 those for the SoRs are 5 Mbps, and for the surrogate servers, 1
 Mbps. Since the SoR has more functions than a regular router,
 the processing time for the SoR may be longer than that for
 regular routers. Therefore, we consider the SoRs service rate
 as 50% of that of a regular router.
 We set the DNS server service rate as equal to that of a
 regular router. We calculate the response time of router-based
 RR by using equation (4) and compare this response time with
 that of DNS-based RR, as calculated by equation (7).
 We consider two Surrogate Servers that have the same
 contents and Server loads. Surrogate Server#1 has a fixed
 delay (36 ms) from SoR. Surrogate Server#2 has a dynamic
 delay varying from 0 to 250 ms. Figure (7) shows response
 time as a function of the network delay of the Surrogate Server
 for different system loads ?. For the following Surrogate
 Server loads; ? = 0.50, ? = 0.75, and ? = 0.90, the
 performance of routing redirection by Router-based RR was
 better than that by DNS-based RR management.
 The differences in response time between the Router-based
 and DNS-based RR are 11 to 14 ms. For Router-based loads
 of 0.5 and DNS-based loads of 0.5, when the network delay
 of Surrogate Server#2, dSS23 ≤ 75 ms, most of the requests
 are redirected to the nearest Surrogate Server. The redirection
 probability obtained by differentiating Equations (1) and (5),
 as shown in Figure 5, the servers destination could be Surro-
 gate Server#1 or Surrogate Server#2, depending on the value
 of redirection probability.
 V. REDIRECTION MANAGEMENT TEST BED
 The test bed for Router-based RR was designed using
 pthread library and UNIX socket communication library; the
 detailed specification can be found in [11]. The simulations
 were designed to be executed on a testing network environ-
 ment of Hitachi Central Research Laboratory in Global Inter
 Cloud Technology Forum (GICTF) [16]. This network has data
 centers at Shin-Kawasaki Campus of Keio University Japan
 (K2 Campus), and at Sendai, Japan.
 As shown in the Figure 8 (upper panel), we implemented
 Router-based RR management in CDN infrastructure. In keep-
 ing with the constraints imposed by our testing network
 resources, we set up one client, three routers (SoRs), and
 two Servers; these resources were sufficient for evaluating
 the proposed method. SoR#1 is the edge SoR for the Client;
 SoR#2, for Server#1; and SoR#3, for Server#2. The DNS-
 based RR management topology is shown in Figure 8 (lower
 panel). We designed a DNS server using UDP socket com-
 munication programs to emulate the real DNS Server. We use
 root DNS, high-level DNS, and low-level DNS emulations for
 comparing the performances of Router-based and the DNS-
 based RR management.
 Experimental network parameters of the test bed system are
 as follows: Service rates of Router#1, Router#2, Redirector,
 and DNS Server are 10 Mbps each, while those of SoR#1,

 SoR#2, and SoR#3 are 5 Mbps each; the rates for the main

 rate from the Client is set as 20 packet/s, i.e., 0.25 Mbps. We
 redirect the Clients request based on the sequence numbers of
 the packets. The results obtained using the experiment test bed
 are shown in Figure 10. In DNS-based connection initiation,
 the RTT for the first set of packets (order packet 1) was >
 0.09 s, while that for the Router-based method was < 0.04 s.
 The RTT average for Router-based RR is 0.026 s, while that
 for DNS-based RR is 0.028 s, as shown in Figure 13; thus,
 the RTT for Router-based RR is less than that for DNS-based
 RR by 7.7
 VI. RELATED WORK
 Previous research has investigated the use and effectiveness
 of CDNs. Recent studies that DNS-based RR techniques add
 noticeable overhead because of DNS latencies. Most of these
 studies have been empirical ones, studying and evaluating
 response times on real CDNs [17] [18], effectiveness of DNS-
 based RR [17] [18] [19], server selection [20] [18], or Server
 location [21]. Other papers and contributions have tried to
 Globecom 2013 Workshop - The 5th IEEE International Workshop on Management of Emerging Networks and Services

model the behavior of CDNs using different techniques, but
 usually simplifying the nature of such systems and losing
 generality. These studies have focused mainly in two top-
 ics: Server placement [22] or evaluation of response time.
 Different techniques have been used for the evaluation of
 the second parameter: linear time response of Web Servers
 [23], Water Filling Schema [24] and Queuing Theory [25].
 An Energy-efficient Routing Protocol [26] can be considered
 to be implemented for the next-CDN technology. In this
 paper, the research works start from basic assumptions in
 queuing theory with M/M/1 queuing model, and introduces
 new features of router-based routing redirection in CDN that
 resemble a more realistic and general model. This way the
 impact on performance of important parameters such as the
 routing redirection probability, network delay, and response
 time can be studied. Moreover, it is worthwhile establishing
 some dependencies and relationships among these parameters,
 as empirical analytic results are always finite and cover only
 a limited variability range of the CDN parameters.
 VII. CONCLUSION
 We adopted empirical, analytical, and experimental approaches
 to study RR performance achieved by different methodology.
 Although the service rate in our model, which employs Router-
 based redirection, is 50% of the service rate of a regular
 Router, it achieved a reduced response time of about 11 to
 14 ms with optimal redirection between the two Servers. This
 response time is 23.3% of that in DNS-based redirection. For
 the performance result based on when the probability of DNS-
 servers cache miss is 0.05 and load is 0.05, the response time
 of the Router-based system is 64 ms, i.e., 4.4% lower than that
 of the DNS-based system. In a congested situation when the
 DNS-servers cache miss is 0.75 and load is 0.90, the response
 time of Router-based is 0.64s, i.e., 44.8% lower than that of
 the DNS-based system. In addition, we conducted a test bed
 implementation of the Router-based redirection method. The
 RTT for the Router-based scheme is 26 ms, i.e., 7.7% lower
 than that of the DNS-based scheme.
