Abstract—Geospatial data that were once difficult to obtain are 
now readily available to the public with the development of 
geospatial technologies. The ubiquitous use of social networking 
and location-based services enables easy sharing of personal 
stories among many people. With or without awareness of 
location disclosure, some users reveal a considerable amount of 
geopersonal information to the general public. Privacy issues 
have been raised again in the GIScience community. This study 
shows that home and work places may be inferred from 
georeferenced tweets of heavy Twitter users. Is privacy still an 
issue in the era of big data when people freely share blogs, photos, 
videos, and spatial footprints over the Internet? Or do people 
willingly decide to give out location information in order to gain 
benefits from the disclosure? After a discussion on possible 
reasons for people to share spatial footprints, this paper invites 
more research on perception of geoprivacy.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Geographic information is essential for many aspects of 
social life. Daily activities, such as navigation in space, require 
the locations of places and relationships among them. For 
example, people rely on knowledge of transportation networks 
in local areas to find the direction from home to work place. 
Geographic information has also been used to study spatial 
patterns of social phenomena. As early as the mid-1800s, John 
Snow plotted on a map the locations of deaths by cholera in 
London, and found a water pump on Broad Street as the source 
of disease. Nowadays, geographic information systems (GISs) 
have been adopted to study a wide range of subjects, including 
public health [1] and crime patterns [2]. While geographic 
information was traditionally produced only by authorities in 
mapping agencies, now it is easy to obtain locational 
information of geographic features with the aid of geospatial 
technologies. Global Positioning System (GPS) devices, for 
instance, enable anyone to easily identify the location of any 
object with good spatial accuracy. High-resolution remote 
sensing imagery technologies provide regular update of large 
areas on the Earth’s surface. Map-making is no longer an 
activity performed only by the government. It has become a 
global effort conducted by millions of people all over the world, 
demonstrated in projects such as OpenStreetMap 
(http://www.openstreetmap.org/) and Google Map Maker 
(http://www.google.com/mapmaker).  
Although geographic information has undoubtedly played a 
critical role in human activities, the release of geospatial data to 
the public arouses debate on associated ethical issues, such as 
privacy. A map of cancer or an infectious disease at point 
locations may put involved people at unexpected risk. 
Therefore, individual geospatial data collected by the 
government are usually aggregated to protect individual 
privacy, as required by law. For example, all individual health 
data must be aggregated to the level of zip code containing 
more than 20,000 people according to the privacy rule of the 
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
(http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/hipaa/understanding/summary
 /privacysummary.pdf).   
It is possible to impose certain regulations on government 
agencies in terms of the use and disclosure of individual 
geographic data. However, when data collection is no longer a 
process monopolized by the government, it is difficult to trace 
every piece of geographic information by its origin and 
transformation, as well as to identify data providers. People, 
whom the law tries to protect may willingly share their private 
locations and daily activities with the public through social 
media and social networking services, such as Twitter, 
Facebook, and Foursquare. For these individuals, important 
geopersonal information may be inferred by analyzing their 
online activities. Do their behaviors imply changed perception 
of geoprivacy? Or are they just not aware of how much they 
have chosen to share with the public? 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 
discusses privacy issues in geospatial data and methods for 
geoprivacy protection. Section 3 describes a new source of 
geospatial data: volunteered geographic information (VGI) [3]. 
Section 4 presents evidence of location disclosure in 
georeferenced tweets. Section 5 discusses people’s motivation 
for sharing spatial footprints and perception of privacy, 
followed by conclusions and future research directions in 
Section 6.  
II. PRIVACY IN GEOSPATIAL DATA 
Individual geographic data is important for understanding 
spatial patterns and addressing many social problems, 
including modeling of health events in spatial epidemiology [4]. 
However, the use of sensitive geographic information causes 
privacy concerns among GIS critics [5]. For instance, 
georeferenced individual health data are very useful for

US Army Research Office (No. W911NF-09-1-0302). 
studying the distribution and spread of diseases, but disclosure 
of such information may put patients into a disadvantageous 
position. One solution adopted by government agencies is 
aggregation of individual data into a geographic unit that 
contains a large number of people, so as to prevent individual 
identification based on location. Although this method is 
effective for protecting individual geographic privacy, it limits 
the types of analysis that can be performed on aggregated data 
and introduces uncertainty into the dataset in the aggregation 
process, by creating Modifiable Areal Unit Problem (MAUP) 
[6,7]. Consequently, some important social questions, such as 
possible sources of disease, cannot be answered. To preserve 
individual spatial distributions, researchers have proposed 
geographical masking as a method to retain original spatial 
patterns and meanwhile protect confidentiality of individuals, 
by modifying locations of point data appropriately [8,9]. In 
these methods, perturbation radius is a key parameter in the 
masking procedure: there is a trade-off between privacy 
protection and analysis accuracy. When the perturbation is 
above a certain threshold, the analysis result is substantially 
different from the original data. In contrast to an analytical 
comparison between original and masked geographic data, 
Leitner and Curtis [10] investigated the perceived visual 
pattern difference after a map is geographically masked. In 
addition to concerns over health data provided by official 
sources, such as the Department of Health, maps included in 
mass media may also cause the risk of privacy violation. For 
example, a map of the mortality locations during Hurricane 
Katrina published in the Baton Rouge Advocate newspaper 
was used to identify house locations within approximately one 
and half city blocks [11].  
III. VGI IN THE ERA OF BIG DATA 
We have entered the era of big data. Emails, blogs, photos, 
videos, and geographic datasets have been generated every day 
by possibly anyone with access to necessary technologies. 
These data are also widely disseminated over the Internet 
through websites such as Twitter, Flickr, Youtube, and 
OpenStreetMap. For the first time in history, people are able to 
collect vast volumes of data on various aspects of human life, 
from conversations about mundane chores of daily life and 
fluctuation of emotions, to discussions on major scientific 
breakthroughs and debate on critical political decisions. Many 
large online datasets do not only record stories of celebrities as 
in the old times, but also lives of ordinary people. According to 
a recent survey conducted by an Internet security company 
AVG, 92% of babies in the U.S. have an online presence 
before they reach the age of two, in the form of an email, a 
social network profile, spatial footprints, and so on. The large 
volumes of data are referred to as big data, which provide a 
great potential to study the complex systems of human life on a 
large number of people. 
VGI, one specific type of user generated content with a 
spatial element, is a new source of geographic data that are 
produced by citizens using geospatial technologies including 
GPS units and Web 2.0 for data collection and distribution. 
One famous VGI project is OpenStreetMap (OSM) with the 
goal of creating a free editable map of the whole world. The 
data contributed to the OSM database have been proved very 
useful in many applications, especially for some areas of the 
world that lack adequate geographic data. For example, when 
the Haiti Earthquake happened in 2010, there was almost no 
appropriate geographic information for Port-au-Prince. Within 
only 48 hours after the earthquake, contributors from all over 
the world used the OSM platform to produce a possibly most 
accurate and complete map of Port-au-Prince, which was later 
used for rescue efforts on the ground. Geographic information 
produced and disseminated through social media and social 
networking services has also been used for emergency response 
and management [12,13]. 
In addition to geographic information that is deliberately 
created by volunteers with some geographic purpose in mind, 
there is another type of geographic information that is recorded 
as digital spatial footprints [14]. Digital spatial footprints are 
traces of locations left by people when they move around the 
Earth’s surface, particularly those recorded by social media or 
location-based services in a digital form. These footprints could 
be locations associated with tweets in Twitter, or places 
attached to photos uploaded to Flickr. The digital locations 
reveal places a person has visited and even the time spent in 
each place. Some location-based services, such as Google 
Latitude, even allow people to be located by others in real time. 
One major motivation to disclose location information is to 
share stories with family and friends and to find local people 
with common interests. While some people may be reluctant to 
share locations with the general public, a substantial number of 
people do so. 
IV. LOCATION DISCLOSURE IN GEOREFERNCED TWEETS 
Most social networking services give users the choices to 
turn on or off the location. For people who leave the location 
option on, some are willing to share their whereabouts with the 
world, while others may not be aware of their locations being 
visible to others. In this study, we used georeferenced tweets 
collected from Twitter to infer people’s home and work places. 
A. Data 
The data were collected using Twitter’s public API and 
stored in a MySQL database. We collected all georeferenced 
tweets within the bounding box of Los Angeles (LA) County in 
California, USA between January 21 and March 7, 2011. In 
total, there were 506,016 georeferenced tweets generated by 
24,369 users. Information associated with each tweet includes 
tweet ID, tweet text, tweet time, tweet location, and user ID as 
shown in Fig. 1 (tweet ID and user ID are not displayed to 
avoid identification of individuals). 
 
Figure1. Sample georeferenced tweets within LA County.  
To study patterns of spatial footprints contributed by 
individual users, we grouped georeferenced tweets by user ID. 
As displayed in Fig. 2, the number of georeferenced tweets 
created by different users produces the long tail effect: most 
georeferenced tweets were generated by a small number of 
people. Among all users, the number of georeferenced tweets 
ranges from 1 to 5039. Table 1 demonstrates the top 5 users 
who generated most georeferenced tweets in our database.

B. Disclosed home and work locations 
In order to infer home and work locations of individual 
users, we linked the georeferenced tweets with land use data 
provided by Southern California Association of Governments 
(SCAG). Land use data in LA contain use code at the parcel 
level. There are several major categories of land use: vacant 
land, single family residence, multiple dwelling, commercial, 
industrial, agricultural, exempt property, natural resources, and 
miscellaneous property. Under each major category, there are 
several sub-categories of land use. The georeferenced tweets 
generated by the top 5 users were extracted from the dataset 
and joined with the land use data. For each user, the number of 
georeferenced tweets located in each parcel was counted. The 
parcel with the largest number of tweets was regarded as a 
main location of user activities. Then the land use code was 
used to differentiate between home and workplace. For the 5 
users, a large number of tweets were generated from a single 
parcel and nearby parcels due to positional uncertainty. The 
percentage of tweets and land use in the parcel with most 
georeferenced tweets for each user is shown in Table 2. 
Although the percentage varies from 32.83% to 73.07%, four 
users created most tweets in a residential parcel and one user 
created most tweets in a commercial parcel. Furthermore, the 
time period associated with the georeferenced tweets contained 
in the parcel spanned across several days. For example, the 
georeferenced tweets created in one residential parcel by the 
first user were generated from 4:54am on January 21, 2011 to 
1:18pm on March 5, 2011. This result indicates that these 
parcels are probably the home locations for four of the five 
users, and work location for one. Fig. 3 demonstrates the tweet 
locations on top of a base map for the first user. This user had a 
wide coverage of tweet locations (Fig. 3a), but most tweets 
were clustered around a single family house (Fig. 3b).

V. CHANGED PERCEPTION OF PRIVACY? 
As shown in the examples above, we can infer home and 
work locations of individuals using georeferenced tweets and 
auxiliary land use data. Although georeferenced tweets 
represent approximately only 1% of all tweets, some users 
share substantial amounts of activity locations and daily

trajectories. There may be two possible reasons. First, they are 
not aware of the type of geopersonal information they give out 
by tweeting with locations. For some location-based services, 
users must opt out of location visibility. By default, current 
location is automatically recorded in the database and shared 
with the public. If these users are aware of the disclosure of 
their home locations and possible uses of their georeferenced 
tweets, they may turn off the location option to protect privacy. 
Second, users who share spatial footprints understand the 
possibility of revealing their locations. However, their level of 
concern about geographic privacy is low. As on some personal 
websites and blogs, people explicitly list their home addresses 
and cell phone numbers.  
Although disclosure of sensitive personal information, such 
as bank accounts and credit cards, is always a concern for 
online security, people may be less worried about their 
geopersonal information: location of their presence, their home, 
and workplace. On the other hand, users sometimes have to 
give out some personal information to take advantage of the 
convenience and efficiency of information and communication 
technologies. Maybe not everyone has access to users’ 
locations, but cell phone companies constantly collect location 
information from phone users. Whenever a credit card is 
swiped, the credit card company immediately knows the 
location of card user. When using Google Maps to search for 
Points of Interest (POIs) or to find direction between two 
places, people give out their locations to Google. Home 
location may no longer be a secret. Location information 
contributed by millions of people has been collected and used 
to predict real-time traffic for route suggestions. In an 
increasingly interconnected society, it is difficult or even 
disadvantageous not to share some type of geopersonal 
information. Since the 1990s, GIS critics have expressed their 
concern over privacy issues associated with the use of 
geospatial technologies. In the era of big data when many 
people are willing to share geographic information when using 
location-based services, the content of geoprivacy may be 
redefined, and location sharing is a choice.   
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
Geographic information has been proved essential for 
performing many spatial tasks, but privacy issues in the use 
geospatial technologies have been a concern. Laws and 
regulations are enforced by government agencies to ensure 
privacy protection before geographic data are released to the 
public. To protect geoprivacy and to preserve spatial patterns 
of original data, geographic masking techniques were 
developed. It may be relatively easy to control release of 
geographic data by the government, but it is almost impossible 
to regulate every piece of geographic information that is 
distributed over the Internet. In this paper, we inferred home 
and work locations from georeferenced tweets generated by 
users in Los Angeles County of California, USA. When 
substantial amounts of georeferenced tweets are generated by a 
user across an extended period of time, it is possible to identify 
his or her home or work location with the aid of land use data. 
When tweet locations are overlayed with a satellite image, it is 
even clearer that most tweets by the same user were created 
around a house, an apartment, or a workplace. It would be 
useful to further study why people share their locational 
information of daily trajectories. If they are not aware of the 
disclosure of locations and possible uses of such data, new 
design of social media and location-based services may be 
required to protect geopersonal privacy. On the other hand, 
when fully informed of possible location revelation, people 
may still decide to share locations for the sake of gained 
benefits from such disclosure, in which case, sharing of 
geopersonal information is a choice, not privacy violation.
