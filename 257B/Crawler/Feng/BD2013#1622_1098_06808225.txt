Abstract—In this paper, spatial data mining is presented in the 
context of big data.  Spatial data plays a primary role in big data, 
attracting human interests. Spatial data mining confronts much 
difficulty when attracting the value hidden in spatial big data. 
The techniques to discover knowledge from spatial big data may 
help data to become intelligent. 
Keywords- Big data; Spatial data mining; Data intelligence 
 
I.  SPATIALLY DISTRIBUTED BIG DATA  
Big data is complex data set that has the following main 
characteristics: Volume, Variety, Velocity and Veracity [1] [2] [3] 
[4]
 . These make it difficult to use the existing tools to manage 
and manipulate [5]. In these data, spatial data specifically 
accounts for the vast majority. About 80% of data is associated 
with the spatial position [6]. Spatial data is the basis of data and 
source of wisdom for people to understand the real-world 
through the information world [7-10]. Big Data is closely related 
to applications [11], and spatial data mining is its principal 
application [1][9-15]. 
Big data centers data, and mines knowledge in the entire 
data, breaking the sampling randomness of the sample[11], and 
demonstrating on big data center and mobile terminal. These 
information technologies serve for the understanding and 
transforming of the real world.  Big data is attracting much 
attention, for example, the United Nations, the United States, 
the People’s Republic of China, Science, Nature, the Wall 
Street Journal, Gartner, McKinsey, Microsoft, IBM, Oracle, 
Google, and Baidu[1-5][16-20]. 
 
A. Spatial data is the basis for big data 
The content of spatial data describes spatial objects’ specific 
geographic orientation and spatial distribution in the real world. 
Spatial data also includes space entities attributes, the number, 
location, and their mutual relations, and covers the entire 
Macro-Meso-Micro level. The data can be the value of point 
height, road length, polygon area, building volume and the 
pixel gray. It can be the string of geographical name and 
annotation. It can also be graphics, images, other multimedia, 
spatial relationships and other topologies [7] [8]. Compared with 
the General data, spatial data is with characteristics of spatial, 
temporal, multi-dimensional, Volume, complex spatial 
relations and so on [1-5]. 
For the tools of collecting spatial data, it can be macro and 
micro sensors or devices such as radar, infrared, optical, 
satellite multispectral scanner, digital camera, imaging 
spectrometer, electronic total station, telescopes, television 
camera, electron microscopy imaging and CT imaging. It can 
be spatial data acquisition means such as conventional field 
measurements, census, land resources survey, map scanning, 
map digitizing and statistics charts. It also can be a process of 
technology applications and analysis spatial data, such as 
computers, networks, GPS, RS and GIS. The concrete content 
includes data sources, the original observations (raw data), as 
well as steps, format conversion, date, time, location, 
personnel, environmental, transmission and history of data 
collecting, editing, storage and using [21-30]. 
The remote sensing Earth observation has become an 
indispensable part of social, [24-26]. Spatial sensors, satellite 
launch, satellite control and other hardware technology has 
made a major breakthrough. In the future, space-based 
information systems and Earth Observing System (EOS) will 
try to establish the ability to get a variety of spatial data real-
 time and around-the-clock. Moreover it will gradually forms 
the satellite (group) of EOS: set of high spatial, high spectral, 
high temporal resolution, wide ground covered and other 
performance, along with positioning, communications and 
observation functions (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). The rapid development 
of sensors also makes the number of bands that describing the 
space object attributes increase from a few to dozens or even 
hundreds. Remote sensing Earth observation technologies are 
supporting a multi-level, multi-angled, all-round and around-
 the-clock global stereoscopic earth observation network which 
combines with high, medium and low orbits and cooperates 
with large, medium and small satellite, and coarse, fine 
resolution complement to each other. The range of ground 
resolution magnitude of the sensor is from kilometers to 
centimeters. The range of wavelength is from ultraviolet to 
long wave. The interval is from ten days once to three times a 
day. The range of probing depth is from a few meters to ten 
thousand meters. Quick Bird, IRS, IKONOS have provided 
high resolution remotely-sensed data through new remote 
sensing earth observation technology marked by high spatial, 
high spectral and high dynamic. Earth observation system with 
multi-sensor, multi-purpose, multi-resolution and multi-
 frequency can provide Moderate-resolution Imaging 
Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, ASTER infrared-image-
 contained data, CERES model data coming from clouds 
measuring and 4-D simulating, MOPIT data and MISR data.

B. Spatial data is the focus of the research and development 
big data 
The research and development of big data involve national 
security, life and health, climate variation, geological survey, 
disaster prevention and reduction and Smart Planet, which are 
all associated with spatial data [1][4][13]. For example, in the 
United States, government established National Information 
Infrastructure in 1993, released National Broadband Plan in 
2010, and invested 200 million dollars to start Big Data 
Research and Development Initiative. In this plan, US 
Geological Survey and National Aeronautics & Space 
Administration are most closely associated to spatial data [2] [3]. 
The USGS John Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and 
Synthesis provides scientists with the place and time to in-
 depth analysis, the most advanced computing ability and the 
collaboration tools to perceive big data sets, which eventually 
promotes the innovation thinking of the Earth System Science 
(ESS). In this center, scientists cooperate to synthesize the 
comprehensive and long-term data, and further convert big data 
and the big ideas of Earth science theory to scientific 
discoveries with the aim to improve the understanding of the 
ESS and response capabilities. For example, species respond to 
climate change, earthquake recurrence rate and the next 
generation of ecological indicators. 
NASA uses advanced information systems to mature big 
data capacity in order to support future Earth observation 
missions. Firstly, the Earth information can be identified by 
NASA Climate Center. Secondly, it can further reduce the risk, 
cost, size and development time of space-based and ground-
 based information system in the Earth Sciences Department. 
Finally, it can also improve the accessibility and practicality of 
scientific data. NASA Earth science data and information 
system project has been active for more than 15 years. This 
project aimed at archiving, processing and publishing Earth 
satellite data, air and ground truth data, in order to ensure that 
scientists and the public can access data from the Earth into 
space, and enhance the ability to respond to climate and 
environmental change. NASA established the global Earth 
observation system is an attempt of international cooperation to 
share and integrate Earth observation data. It teamed up with 
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the U.S. National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and many other 
agencies and countries. It has integrated satellite and ground-
 based monitoring and modeling systems to assess 
environmental conditions and predict events (such as forest 
fires, population growth and other natural or human 
development issues). In the foreseeable future, researchers will 
integrate the complex air quality information in order to have a 
better understanding and find a better method to deal with the 
air quality impact on the environment and human health. 
NASA sets a space action agreement with Cray Company, 
which allows one or more projects cooperate around the 
development and application of low-latency big data system. 
NASA also uses the highly integrated non-SQL databases to 
transfer data, in order to accelerate the modeling and analysis 
of software running to test the practicality of the hybrid 
computer system. NASA Planetary Data System is a planetary 
mission data archives, and has become the basic resources for 
scientists all around the world, one of which is planetary 
discipline online catalog system, via which all products can be 
peer-reviewed, improved records and do access or queries. 
Multitasking archive of NASA Space Telescope Science 
Institute is a part of the distributed space science data services 
which focuses mainly on the spectrum and other science-
 related data sets of optical, ultraviolet and infrared. It also 
provides various astronomical data archives that supporting a 
variety of tools to access. NASA Earth System Grid Federation 
is a public archives and cooperates with the U.S. Department of 
Energy to provide observations and models for the Federal 
Government. Word Wind, released by NASA is an open source 
geographic science software, which shows the three 
dimensional Earth model provided by NASA, USGS, and other 
WMS vendor. Through this software users can browse the 
historical image data, monitor disaster events by Modis data 
and dynamic monitor of global temperatures.[9][31] 
In addition, special mitigation satellites, remote sensing 
satellites, communication and navigation satellites have been 
widely used in a variety of disaster management, such as 
earthquakes, tsunamis, typhoons (hurricanes), floods, droughts, 
geological disasters and fire. Currently, Disaster Monitoring 
Constellation is a system that consists of satellites from various 
countries through international cooperation. This system has 
these follow characteristics, high time resolution, large monitor 
range and fast response. It can be widely used disaster 
reduction process and disaster mapmaking in floods, hurricanes 
and fires.  
 
II.  SPATIAL DATA DISASTER 
Spatial data is closely related to human daily life, permeated all 
walks of life. The number, size and complexity are all in sharp 
increasing. A large amount of data has been stored in the 
spatial database and warehouse in types of text, graphics, 
images and multimedia [9-10][15]. The research from International 
Data Corporation [16] has shown that, as of 2003 humans have 
created a total of 5EB data, while in the year of 2011, the 
amount of data that had been copied and produced is exceeded 
1.8ZB. It is expected that by 2020 global data usage will reach 
35.2ZB, which needs 37.6 billion hard drives of 1TB capacity 
to store. On the one hand these data broadens the scope of 
available spatial data available for human to gain wisdom. On 
the other hand the value of a single unit of the data is rapidly 
declining. Human is submerged by the data ocean but thirsty 
for knowledge[32-35]. 
Big data is voluminous and it grows quickly, but it has very 
low density in value, which means there is a lot of junk data [31].  
Spatial data from the real world is polluted [33]. There are a 
variety of causes lead to spatial data incomplete. Inaccurate 
spatial data means incorrect value compared with the reality of 
the physical attributes. Duplicate records means one real-world 
recorded is stored in a multi-source spatial data tautologically, 
or the real-world information is duplicated stored in multiple 
systems. Inconsistent spatial data refers to the case that space 
488
data context-related conflicts are caused by different systems 
and applications on type, format, granularity, synonyms, 
encoding, and so on.  
The production, transmission, replication and accumulation 
of data have gone far beyond people's capacity for analyzing, 
understanding and implementing [34].  
Over time, all walks of life are submerged by contaminated 
data garbage, and then it could lead the big data into "garbage 
in, garbage out", and the “big data” becomes the useless “big 
garbage”. Now, useful data is buried, and implied value is 
blanked in big data[35].  
 
III. THE VALUE OF SPATIAL DATA 
Adam Smith, a well-known Scottish economist, believed that 
“useful things” can be treated as capital. Data is valuable, and 
its value is in increasing via adaptive self-learning. Spatial big 
data is collected from numerous and interconnected sources. 
Real usefulness is its maximum value. The generally accepted 
rule of big data is “decision on data”. The first prerequisite is to 
keep data always useful and activated. The ultimate value of 
big data is to gain human intelligence [9][11]][38]. 
Big data provides an unprecedented opportunity to observe 
the real world in a full view rather than partial samples [4] [17] 
[39]
 .  
Big data are treated as Basic resources. McKinsey [4] believes 
that data is the basic resource, and can be compared with 
physical assets, human capital, create significant value for the 
world economy, improve the productivity and competitiveness 
of the enterprises and the public sector, and create a large 
number of economic surplus for consumers. In 2012, Gartner 
believes that “Big data is big money”. The U.S. government 
considers big data as “new oil” related to the country's 
economic restructuring and industrial upgrading [2] [3][40]. 
 
IV. SPATIAL DATA MINING 
Spatial data mining refers to the basic technologies to realize 
the value of big data, relocate data assets, and use it effectively. 
Spatial data mining can be used to extract information from 
data, mine knowledge from information, extract data 
intelligence in knowledge, improve the ability of self-learning, 
self-feedback adaptation, finally realize human-machine 
intelligence[9][41]. 
 
A. Basic big data technology 
The basic techniques of big data include data collection, 
storage, processing, expression, and quality evaluation [18].  
Big data can be generated in mobile devices, tracking 
systems, radio frequency identification devices (RFIDs), sensor 
networks, social networking, Internet search, automatic 
recording systems, video archives, e-commerce, as well as the 
process in analyzing those data. The acquisition mode of big 
data can be divided into three types: Point acquisition, plane 
acquisition, and mobile acquisition [11]. The point acquisition 
means collecting spatial coordinates and attributes of the 
surface point-by-point through total station, GPS receivers and 
other conventional ground-based measurement. The plane 
acquisition means collecting images of large areas through air 
and space with remote sensing methods, to extract the 
geometric and physical properties. The mobile acquisition 
means integrating the use of space positioning system 
(currently mainly refers to the Global Positioning System), 
Remote Sensing (RS) and Geographic Information Systems 
(GIS) to collect, store, manage, update, analyze and apply 
spatial data in EOS.  
Big data storage technology is the basis for data mining. It 
is designed to meet the growing need for data storage, which 
aims to provide scalability, high reliability, excellent 
performance data storage, access, and management solution, 
such as distributed data storage, multiple levels caching, load 
balancing, fault-tolerant mechanisms. Conventional methods 
are not adequate for these missions. It needs to establish a large 
platform for data through software, to provide places to store 
and interface to access. In February 2012, researchers at the 
University of York in UK developed a heat rather than the 
magnetic field of computer hard disk data storage technology, 
that reduces energy consumption while reach the storage speed 
of thousands of GB per second [32]. In October 2012, the 
Fujifilm and IBM developed a barium ferrite particles coated 
tape, which can store 35TB data in the size of 10cm ? 2cm [33]. 
In December, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 
synthesized the third magnetic state herbertsmithite pure 
crystal, which may have a tremendous impact on magnetic 
storage technology [34]. 
Big data processing is to implement the transitions: from 
data to information, from information to knowledge and from 
knowledge to wisdom. Big data processing includes object 
superposition, target buffer, spatial data cleaning, spatial data 
analysis, spatial data mining, spatial feature extraction, image 
segmentation, and image classification. 
Big data expression technology is designed to represent the 
data in a clear and effective way that reveals meaningful 
information to the user, or provide the user with a new 
perspective of view. Big data expression technology includes 
triangulated irregular networks, digital elevation models, 
digital terrain models, flat maps, three-dimensional maps, 
image maps, and digital city maps. 
Big data quality assessment technology is aimed to avoid 
the risk of big data collecting and high-density measuring. The 
technology includes logical assessment method, exception 
value based assessment method, and accounting based 
assessment method. 
 
B. Discovery Spatial knowledge 
Spatial knowledge discovery is the technology that uses spatial 
data mining method to extract previously unknown, potentially 
useful, and ultimately comprehensible rules. It is also a process 
of gradual sublimation from spatial data to space information, 
and to space knowledge, step-by-step. Spatial data mining 
systems aims to make spatial data gradually summarized into 
spatial knowledge. Through the integration of space data, it can 
489
deeply extract space knowledge. By using such new 
knowledge, data can be processed in real time in order to 
understand and apply the data, to make intelligent judgments 
and well-informed decisions. Space knowledge can be self-
 learning, self-enhance, universal, and easily recognized. It 
could serve as a basis for decision support. 
If businesses take full advantage of spatial knowledge, it 
will be more precise and dynamic for humans to learn, work, 
life, and achieve wisdom state. It will help to improve resource 
utilization and productivity level. Moreover, it will also help to 
respond to the economic crisis, the energy crisis, the 
deterioration of the environment and many other global issues. 
 
C. Extraction data intelligence 
Data intelligence is the ability to obtain a more innovative, 
systematic and comprehensive knowledge to solve a particular 
problem through an in-depth analysis of the collected data. It is 
an ability to understand and solve problems fast, flexibly and 
correctly. Spatial data intelligent has three features: more 
thoroughly perception, more extensive interoperability, and 
deeper intelligence. The three features are aimed to get bigger 
and more comprehensive data,  to share and co-operate data via 
the Internet, to do data analysis and data mining by variety of 
advanced techniques, and to constitute a hierarchy of spatial 
data intelligences (Fig. 3) [35] [36].  
More in-depth data intelligence is to create new value of 
data. On the one hand, when making full use of spatial data 
knowledge in all walks of life, it can produce secondary 
knowledge. In order to form a mining mechanism to mine 
knowledge in knowledge, it needs to bring primary knowledge 
together to form an intelligent form of expression. Ultimately, 
the destination knowledge can be achieved. On the other hand, 
based on a general industrial or socio-ecological system, it can 
redefine the interactive mode of government, companies and 
individuals, so that it improves the interaction clarity, 
efficiency, flexibility and response speed. It changes from the 
traditional single dimension such as: production consumption, 
management, or planning execution, to a new multi-
 dimensional collaborative relationship. In this new relationship, 
both individuals and organizations can freely contribute and get 
information and expertise accurately and timely. This new 
relationship exerts a positive influence on each other to reach 
smart running macro-effects[40]. 
Spatial data prompted the fusion of world's digital 
infrastructure and physical infrastructure. Almost anyone or 
anything can be connected to a digital network at low-cost. It is 
easy to embed sensors in a variety of ecosystems. It can be 
more sophisticated, dynamic management of production and 
life to achieve the smart status, through global infrastructure of 
equipment and devices, via the integration of human society 
and the physical system by Internet, with supercomputers and 
cloud computing. For example, space knowledge can be found 
through integrating the data from satellite positioning systems, 
sensors, and wireless networks. , Spatial knowledge is then 
transferred to the mobile phone terminal, which helps users 
make reasonable judgment based on location services in order 
to achieve the intelligent data transformation into wisdom (Fig. 
3).  Firstly, the reality space world is thoroughly studied 
through the acquisition of spatial data from satellite positioning 
systems, sensors and wireless networks. Secondly, the spatial 
data is stored and managed by appropriate method, in order to 
integrate into spatial information. Thirdly, a variety of spatial 
knowledge is extracted through purposefully data mining 
methods and mining model. Spatial knowledge is integrated to 
the new available knowledge, in order to reach deeper data 
intelligence. Finally, data intelligence is integrated into the 
digital earth and the "Internet of things", in order to enhance 
the wisdom of users and machines, and to achieve smarter real 
world data interaction [41-43].

V. CONCLUSION 
The development of big data extends the scope of human 
activities. The world has been cooperating and integrating on a 
global scale. It redefines the relationship among individuals, 
businesses, organizations, governments, and societies through 
networked thinking and further to improve the human living 
environment, to enhance the quality of public services, to 
improve performance, efficiency and productivity through the 
interactive operation. The technological progress and industrial 
upgrading of big data will create new markets, business models 
and industry rules, and more importantly it demonstrates the 
collective will of a country that looking for strategic advantage. 
Although there is still a large gap to gain data intelligence like 
human wisdom, big data is a promising topic to understand the 
world from an entirely new aspect.
