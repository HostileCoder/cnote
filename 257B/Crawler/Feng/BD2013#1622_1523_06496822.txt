Abstract-During last 10 years, the use of frequencies at E?
 band from 71 GHz to 76 GHz, from 81 GHz to 86 GHz and 
from 92 GHz to 95 GHz to licensed users has been regulated in 
lJS, Europe, Australia and Japan. Due to the large amount of 
available bandwidth and reasonable atmospheric attenuation, 
these frequency bands are suitable for very high data rate 
radio communication for medium to long range wireless links. 
However, in order to convert the bandwidth availability into 
real capacity, suitable transmission techniques should be 
designed. In the present paper, we propose a space-frequency 
multiplexing technique using FDM, coded modulation and 4x4 
MIMO spatial multiplexing for point-to-point multi-gigabit 
connection in the 81-86 GHz bandwidth. We tested the 
proposed system, considering different link distances, different 
values of pathloss and atmospheric and rain attenuations. 
Simulation results evidenced the possibility of achieving a 48 
Gb/s net capacity over 5GHz bandwidth (spectral efficiency 9.6 
b/s/Hz) with 99.98% availability at link distances up to 1 Km.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Nowadays, fiber optic connections are conveying gigabit 
per second data streams to residential users spread almost 
everywhere. However, there are still a lot of users that are 
not reached by fiber. Recent data published by FTTH 
Council Europe evidenced a great difficult of fiber 
penetration in the EU area [1]. Only nine of the 21 nations 
individually analyzed should achieve "FTTH maturity" 
(20% penetration) by 2016, namely: Lithuania, Norway, 
Sweden, Slovak Republic, Latvia, Estonia, Denmark, 
Portugal and Bulgaria. Moreover, it is forecasted that seven 
of the 21 nations will still be fewer than 10% penetration at 
978-1-4673-1813-61131$31.00 й2013 IEEE 
the end of 2016, namely: UK, Italy, Germany, Switzerland, 
Spain and Austria. The biggest issue in fiber networking 
setup is not mainly inherent to the cost of the fiber itself 
(10,000 Euros/Km for big cables installed in big towns), but 
to the very high cost of the fiber installation roadwork 
(some rough estimates reported amounts of the order of 
300,000 Euros/Km). This motivates the search for 
alternative solutions based on point-to-point Line-of-Sight 
(LOS) wireless transmission, targeted at complementing 
and/or replacing fiber optic connections. These kinds of 
solutions are also able to solve the so-called "last mile 
problem" implementing a relatively cheap technology (w.r.t. 
the wired ones) able to support a fast network deployment. 
Broadband multi-gigabit connections require a big amount 
of bandwidth (of the order of some GHz) and the radio 
spectrum is usually quite miser and crowded. The only way 
to find large bandwidth spaces in RF is to exploit the 
millimeter wave spectrum portions, namely the Extremely 
High Frequency (EHF) bands. 
The use of EHF for short and medium range point-to-point 
terrestrial communications has been considered recently 
worldwide [2]. Federal Communications Commission 
(FCC) has regulated the use of frequencies at E-band from 
71 GHz to 76 GHz, from 81 GHz to 86 GHz and from 92 
GHz to 95 GHz to licensed users in 2003. In Europe, 
Electronic communication committee (ECC) has 
recommend, through the ECC/REC (05)/07 such frequency 
bands for broadband fixed radio link applications. Similarly 
to US and EU, a document issued in 2008 by the Ministry of 
Economic Development of Australia [3] contains some 
preliminary regulations on the usage of E-bands for 
terrestrial wireless communications (in [3], data rates of 10 
Gbps over 8 km links are envisioned). In Japan, thorough 
studies on the radio propagation at 70 GHz have been issued 
since 2000 by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone 
Corporation (NIT) and National Institute of Information 
and Communications Technology (NICT) for indoor [4] [5] 
and outdoor mobile environments, as well as for trains [6]. 
These studies outlined the propagation losses in different 
environments, considering line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line?
 of-sight (NLOS) fixed and mobile scenarios. The 
transmission solutions adopted for millimeter wave multi-
gigabit transmission in terrestrial links are various, 
differentiated essentially by the application environment. 
Indoor and mobile transmissions, characterized by NLOS 
propagation with multi path, favor solutions based on OFOM 
[7]. Alternative solutions for Gigabit WLAN are based on 
UWB-like ASK-PPM modulation with time hopping [8]. In 
their very recent work [9], Kang et. al. present a single?
 carrier 16-QAM-based eight-channel E-band transceiver 
that can achieve a spectral efficiency of 3.2 blslHz and a bit?
 rate up to 10 Gbps. Another example of an E-band 
transceiver for LOS outdoor multi-gigabit applications is 
reported in [10]; together with different system architectures 
mainly based on COTS technologies. A very interesting 
realization of a multi-gigabit communication system at the 
81 GHz to 86 GHz frequency band has been presented in 
[11]. The system is composed of an indoor segment to 
provide large bandwidth inside the buildings and an outdoor 
segment targeted to LOS connections of different buildings 
(that are regarded as picocells). The target of the developed 
prototype system was to provide a data rate of 6 Gbps. Such 
a result has been achieved by means of 8-PSK modulation 
combined with a spectrally-efficient multichannel 
transmIssIOn, based on analog frequency division 
multiplexing (FDM) and root-raised cosine digital filters. 
Another interesting solution for multi-gigabit "beyond Ka?
 band" communication system based on UWB approach has 
been presented in [12]; this solution is robust to additive 
jitter due to the typical phase noise of oscillators and mixers 
and distortions due to HP A. 
Such a state-of-the-art overview confirms that the 
technology for multi-gigabit PHY-Iayers operating in the 
millimeter wave domain is quite mature for market launch. 
High spectral efficiencies and, consequentially, very high 
data rates are already available. However, bandwidth 
resources can be exploited more efficiently by multiplexing 
information not only in time or frequency domain, but also 
in the space domain. Multiple-Input Multiple-Output 
(MIMO) links can exploit multipath signals in NLOS 
environment [13]. An alternative approach, namely 
millimeter-wave MIMO, establishes multiple parallel links 
in a LOS environment [14]. Basic theory for such 
architecture was presented in [14]. In [15], a 1 x2 MIMO 
system hardware prototype, capable at supporting I.2Gb/s 
data rate with two-channel spatial multiplexing over 41m 
range, has been presented. Experimental results of [15] 
show a very good behavior of the spatial multiplexing with 
tolerable values of cross-channel interference and BER less 
than 2 10.6 on both channels simultaneously. 
In this paper, spatial multiplexing obtained by MIMO 
antennas and frequency division multiplexing are integrated 
at system level in order to boost capacity up to 48 Gb/s of 
net data rate with a bandwidth occupation of 5GHz. The 
achieved spectral efficiency is, therefore, 9.6 b/s/Hz. The 
key techniques used for broadband transmission are:

 Check (LOPC) coding;

е Frequency-Division Multiplexing (FDM) with 
root-raised cosine filtering (similar to [11]); 
е 4x4 MIMO Spatial Multiplexing (SM) with V?
 BLAST decoding algorithm [13]. 
The link availability will be tested in the presence of 
atmospheric attenuation and rain fading, for which 
experimental models used in common practice will be 
considered. The paper is structured as follows: Section 2 
will describe the transmission system in details. Section 3 
will consider the analysis of E-band channel with particular 
reference to atmospheric attenuation and rain fading. 
Section 4 will show and discuss some selected simulation 
results. Section 5 will draw paper conclusion. 
2. SPACE AND FREQUENCY MULTIPLEXING FOR 
MULTI-GIGABIT POINT-TO-POINT TRANSMISSION 
A. Spatial multiplexing and demultiplexing (MIMO) 
Fig.l shows the pictorial scheme of the proposed point-to?
 point MIMO wireless transmission system. The two 
buildings connected via radio truly represent picocells 
where the broadband connection is supported by WLAN 
infrastructures. The point-to-point link is conceived like a 
bridge connection complementing andlor replacing the fiber 
connection. The block diagram of the multi gigabit MIMO 
transmitter is shown in Fig.2. 
Figure 1 - Pictorial scheme of the proposed point-to?
 point wireless transmission system 
The two MIMO arrays are installed on the top of the roofs 
and are supposed in full visibility. We consider a 4x4 
rectangular array of antenna elements spaced according the 
relationship ([11][13]): 
D=?:A (1) 
where R is the link range and A is the carrier wavelength. 
Based on this result, we can provide in Tab.l the size of the 
antenna array for different link ranges at a carrier frequency 
of 81 GHz.

SOOm 2m x2m 
1 Km 2.9 m x 2.9 m 
2Km 4.1 m x 4.1 m 
S Km 6.S m x 6.S m 
It is evident at a glance that the array size becomes a bit 
embarrassing if link distances are larger than 1 Km, even 
though we consider for installation very high roofs of very 
big urban buildings. This latter may represent a serious issue 
that, however, falls outside the scopes of our work. It can be 
said that the very small wavelength and the high directivity 
of the antennas may allow good performance of the spatial 
multiplexing even with reduced-size antenna arrays. This 
specific aspect will be matter for future research works. 
In order to boost system capacity, we consider the use of 
Vertical BLAST (Bell Laboratories Layered Space-Time), 
namely V-BLAST, space-time coding [11]. Other space 
division multiplexing detection algorithms could be used 
but V-BLAST has been selected because it is a well?
 consolidated technique to maintain a very high spectral 
efficiency. 
A single data stream is demultiplexed into M=4 substream. 
Differently than in D-BLAST, no redundancy is added to 
the bitstream. In V-BLAST, the vector encoding is simply a 
demultiplex operation, followed by independent bit-to-
 978-1-4673-1813-61131$31.00 й2013 IEEE 
3 
symbol mapping of each substream. No inter-substream 
coding is required, though conventional coding of the 
individual substreams may be applied (indeed; this has been 
done in our system, using LOpe codes applied to each 
individual substream). The received signal can be expressed 
as follows: 
r=Hx+n (2) 
where ! is the vector containing the M transmitted symbol, 
!!. is a noise vector with independent and identically?
 distributed Gaussian components with zero mean and 
variance (j2 and H is the channel matrix. In LOS point-to?
 point transmissions, the elements of H are expressed as 
follows [12]: 
1 -2"j[ d(m,n)-R] 
h(m,n) =-e A m,n = I, . . .  ,M (3) Ltot 
L,O' being the total link attenuation (due to pathloss, gas 
absorption and rain fading) and d ( m, n) the distance 
between the m'h transmitter element and the nih receiver 
element. The deterministic nature of H is inherent to the 
"free-space" typology of transmission, where multi path 
propagation does not affect the signal. 
The V-BLAST decoding algorithm is based on symbol 
cancellation and linear nulling. Using symbol cancellation, 
interference from already-detected components of x IS 
subtracted out from the received signal vector, resulting in a 
modified receiver vector in which fewer interferers are 
present. The V-BLAST algorithm can be formulated in 
recursive form, as shown in the flowchart of Fig.3.

B. LDPC channel coding 
Low-Density-Parity-Check codes have raised a lot of 
interest in recent years, although they were proposed 50 
years ago by Gallagher [16]. LOPC codes belong to the 
class of block codes. The name comes from the 
characteristic of their parity-check matrix which contains 
only a few l's in comparison to the amount of O's. 
Unlike many other classes of codes, LOPC codes are 
already equipped with very fast (probabilistic) encoding and 
decoding algorithms. 
978-1-4673-1813-61131$31.00 й2013 IEEE 
4 
Now LOPC coding is employed in multimedia transmission 
applications, like DVB-S2. In our system, we adopt LDPC 
coding in order to provide substream protection against 
channel errors. The parity check matrix of the code is 
randomly generated. We consider one of the parity check 
matrix adopted by OVB-S2 standard; in particular the 
matrix 32400x64800, achieving a 1/2 code-rate. 
The chosen modulation format is the 64-QAM, which has 
been indicated in [11] as the maximum realistic modulation 
order usable in E-band. Considering the adopted channel 
coding, we attain a net spectral efficiency of 3 b/s/Hz per 
substream. 
C. Nyquist-based Frequency-Domain Multiplexing 
In a MIMO multi-gigabit transmission system, every MIMO 
channel actually transmits at a coded data-rate of tenths of 
Obis. Such a very high data-rate would require AID and 
DI A converters operating at multi-gigas ample per second 
speeds. Commercial AID and DI A devices can support 
sampling speed of few gigasamples/sec. For this reason, we 
must use a number of digital channels operating at lower 
sampling speed. Among the different options, we consider a 
frequency-domain channel multiplexing technique very 
similar to the one adopted in [11]. This multiplexing 
combines the DI A converted outputs of the root-raised 
cosine filters without need for guard-bands. Analog 
bandpass filters are used to reject only unwanted Nyquist 
responses. The output of the multiplexer is an intermediate?
 frequency (IF) signal containing the FDM. Then, this signal 
is converted in the 81-86 GHz band and, finally sent to the 
radio channel by one of the four MIMO antennas. In FigA 
(a) and (b) the frequency-division multiplexer and the 
related de-multiplexer are shown. 
The subchannel 1 is directly generated by the 01 A: it is 
substantially a baseband modulated data stream with raised 
cosine waveform. Channel 2, 3, ... , N are generated by 
frequency translation in steps of B, = rchan (1 + a) / N , 
rchan being the channel symbol rate and athe RSC roll-off 
factor. An identical BPF filter, aimed at filtering the second 
Nyquist zone of the DI A output, is used to reject aliases and 
spurious components coming from the 01 A converter [11]. 
Band-pass filters BPFI-BPF(N-l) are used to remove 
images arising from frequency translation. Using sharp 
BPFs and RRC filters, we achieve high spectral efficiency 
making the orthogonal subchannels contiguous one with 
another without need of guard bandwidth. 
The proposed multiplexing technique exhibits some 
advantages against Orthogonal Frequency Division 
Multiplexing (OFOM), proposed in other works [7]. Indeed, 
OFDM requires the management of a computationally?
 demanding signal processing tool like Fast-Fourier?
 Transform (FFT) at a very high sampling rate. 
Using a 64-QAM modulation with 1/2 LOPC channel 
coding and root-raised cosine waveform with roll-off factor 
of 0.25 (such a value has been considered in [11]), we can 
obtain an RF spectral efficiency for each MIMO channel of 
2.4 b/s/Hz and 9.6 b/s/Hz for the entire 4x4 MIMO system. 
Considering a 5GHz bandwidth, the total net data rate 
transferred through the link is 48 Gb/s. The number of FOM 
subchannels N is fixed to 8 for a step Bs=625 MHz and a 
channel symbol-rate of 500 Mbaud/sec. These last two 
values are identical to those indicated in [ll], which can be 
fully supported by COTS commercial hardware.

3. CHANNEL ANALYSIS AND MODELING 
One of the strongest drawback in the use of millimeter-wave 
telecommunication system is the high additional attenuation 
due to atmospheric impairment, in particular due to gaseous 
absorption and rain fading, which has to be added to the free 
space losses and carefully taken into account in the system 
design. Moreover, as reported in [17], other propagation 
effects have to be considered in the design of line-of-sight 
systems: 
978-1-4673-1813-61131$31.00 й2013 IEEE 
5 
е free-space attenuation; 
е attenuation due to solid particles in the atmosphere; 
е variation of the angle-of-arrival at the receiver 
terminal and the angle-of-launch at the transmitter 
terminal due to refraction; 
е reduction in cross-polarization discrimination in 
multi-path or precipitation conditions; 
е fading due to atmospheric multi-path or beam 
spreading (commonly referred to as defocusing) 
associate with abnormal refractive layers; 
е fading due to multi-path arising from surface 
reflection; 
е signal distortion due to frequency selective fading 
and delay during multi-path propagation. 
For E-band LOS channel, the effects due to multi-path 
propagation have been, at first instance, neglected. This 
position is justified by the fact that, even for a single 
reflection, the power of a multi-path signal is significantly 
lower than the one of the LOS signal [18]. Moreover, no 
particular obstacle has been considered in the propagation 
path, hence every possible diffraction loss dependent on 
path clearance has been neglected . 
No abnormal gradients of refractive index condition along 
the path has been taken into account, considering also the 
relative low propagation distance, from 500 m to 5 km; 
hence, even if the E-band antennas considered in the 
simulations are able to create very narrow beams, the effects 
of variation of the angle-of-arrival and of the angle-of?
 launch due to refraction are neglected. 
To evaluate the gaseous absorption ITU-R model can be 
used [19]. The main contributions in EHF are due to oxygen 
and water vapor. In the E-band, around 94 GHz, there is a 
so-called "transmission window", a minimum of oxygen 
absorption. Considering standard atmospheric condition the 
specific attenuation in E-band calculated using ITU-R is 
lower than 3 dB/km. 
Rain is the phenomenon that is responsible of the highest 
contribution to the total additive attenuation above 10 GHz 
(an exception occurs for frequencies near oxygen resonance 
peak). Rain attenuation characteristics can be identified 
using the model proposed in recommendation ITU-R P.838-
 3 [20], which is substantially a modification of the model 
proposed by Crane in [21]: 
(4) 
where F is the rainfall intensity (expressed in mm/h) , 
f-L and q are determined as functions of carrier frequency. 
For 86 GHz carrier frequency, the values of /1 and q are 
1.2387 and 0.6968 respectively. 
The results are presented in Fig. 5 and 6 that show rain 
attenuation vs. rainfall intensity and cumulative distribution 
of rainfall intensity respectively. The cumulative 
distribution of rainfall intensity has been derived by 
experimental meteorological data reported in [22] (these 
data are related to the Spanish region). The cumulative 
distribution of rain attenuation for different link distances 
(from 500 mt to 5 km) that will be used in system 
simulations is reported in Fig. 7.

4. SIMULATION RESULTS 
The first series of simulation results, obtained in MA TLAB?
 SIMULINK environment, have been shown in Fig.8 (in 
Fig.9, the SIMULINK block diagram of the MIMO 
transmitter/receiver simulator is drawn). The plotted curve 
shows the bit-error-rate (BER) measured at the output of the 
MIMO receiver (after LDPC and V-BLAST decoding) vs. 
channel per-bit-signal-to-noise ratio. One can notice that 
BER is less than 10-6 for channel Ei/No larger than 7dB. A 
BER of 10-8 can be regarded as a reliable quality threshold 
for high-speed Internet applications. This implies that the 
channel Ei/No should be higher than 9dB.

In order to test the link availability in terms of percentage of 
service time, we first computed the channel signal-to-noise 
ratio as a function of the link distance in clear-sky 
conditions. In order to obtain this curve, we consider the 
following link budget parameters, which are reasonable for 
commercial devices working in the SI-S6 GHz band: 
Transmitted power: 1 W; 
Modulation/demodulation losses: 4dB; 
TXIRX antenna gain: 24dBi (horn antennas are 
used); 
Gaseous absorption: 3dB/Km; 
Low-Noise Amplifier (LNA) gain: 21 dB; 
Receiver noise figure: SdB. 
Considering these link budget parameters, the mathematical 
expression of the channel per-bit-signal-to-noise ratio vs. 
link distance R is given as follows: 
(Eb/ No )dB = 26.9 - 3Rkm - 20 JoglO (Rkm) (5) 
In Fig.IO, the channel signal-to-noise ratio vs. link distance 
is plotted. It can be noticed that the channel Ei/No drops 
down the threshold of 9dB when the link distance is longer 
than 3 Km. Therefore, reasonable link distances taking into 
account the presence of rain fading ranges from 500 m to 2 
Km.

Fig.11 shows some curves plotting the channel signal-to?
 noise ratio vs. the percentage of service time, considering 
the presence of rain fading (whose cumulative distribution 
curves have been shown in Fig.7). It is evident that the link 
availability is higher than 99.99% for a link distance of 500 
m, whereas it is higher than 99.9S% for a link distance of I 
Km. On the other hand, the link availability decreases below 
99.9% for a link distance of 2 Km.

5. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
In this paper a novel transmission system for multi-gigabit 
wireless point-to-point transmission has been proposed and 
tested. The system is based on multiplexing of channel?
 coded 64-QAM-modulated data streams in space and 
frequency domains. A 4x4 MIMO system has been adopted 
for spatial multiplexing, while the frequency-domain 
multiplexing has been performed by means of the analog 
frequency-division multiplexing of the DI A converted 
outputs of the root-raised cosine filters. The proposed 
system can achieve a spectral efficiency of 9.6 b/s/Hz, 
providing a net data rate of 48 Gb/s at link distances up to 
lKm with a link availability higher than 99.98%. Such 
noticeable result can be obtained by using commercial 
components. 
Future research work may consider the use of adaptive 
modulation and coding in order to increase link availability 
and the use of an increased number of antenna elements at 
the receiver side. This would increase the receiver 
complexity and cost, together with the throughput and the 
service availability.
