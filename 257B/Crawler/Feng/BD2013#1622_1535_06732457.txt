Abstract — Defining semantic functional similarity measures 
provides effective means to validate protein function prediction 
methods and to retrieve biologically relevant information from 
big biological data. It also improves understanding of inter-
 relationship between genes and gene products (GPs). 
Currently, one of the most commonly used tools for 
functionally annotating genes and GPs is the Gene Ontology 
(GO), which describes genes/GPs using a machine-readable 
language. To measure the semantic similarity between two GO 
terms, many studies that are based on GO topology have 
recently been reported. However, a comprehensive assessment 
and general guidelines for validating these methods are 
lacking. In this paper, we collect a large dataset to evaluate five 
often-used semantic similarity measure methods by estimating 
sequence similarity, phylogenetic profile similarity, and 
structural similarity. We further compare the measures in 
terms of their clustering performance using domains extracted 
from SCOP database. We describe some key aspects of these 
measure methods and discuss how the limitations may be 
addressed as well as some open problems.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Gene Ontology (GO) [1] is a structured vocabulary of 
biological terms and the de facto standard for genome 
annotation, which describes molecular function, biological 
process and cellular component of genes and gene products 
(GPs) in a species-independent manner. It has been widely 
used in gene function understanding, pathway analysis, and 
network modeling, among many others. GO functional 
terms are defined by several sources including wet-
 laboratory works; therefore, GO annotation implies 
integrative information of multiple data sources, which can 
be purified by controlling the hierarchal relations of terms 
and the GO evidence code. Furthermore, GO facilitates 
information exchanges between different biological 
communities by providing controlled vocabularies and 
uniform queries across them.  
One of the most important tasks in GO-based 
applications is to understand functional similarities between 
two GO terms. In general, GO is structured as a directed 
acyclic graph (DAG), where each node represents a GO 
term and a directed edge starts from a parent node and ends 
at a child node. While GO can state that a child node has a 
more specialized term than its parent nodes, it does not 
provide quantitative measures that reflect the similarities 
between any two GO terms. Quantitative similarity measure 
is important in many GO-based applications. For example, 
in protein function prediction [2-3], knowing the similarity 
between the predicted GO terms and true GO terms a 
protein possesses helps improve the assessment of various 
predictive models.  
 
 
 
Figure 1. Overview of current similarity measuring methods 
 
Current methods for term similarity measures are 
mostly based on the topology of the GO graph [4-7] and can 
be roughly grouped into four categories, as shown in Fig. 1. 
The first group uses Information Content (IC) based on the 
number of GPs [8-11], which is calculated as the ratio 
between the number of GPs at root node (i.e. GO:0003674 
in Fig. 1) and the number of GPs at Nearest Common 
Ancestor (NCA), the closest node from leaf nodes or the 
farthest node from the root node (i.e. the red rectangle in 
Fig. 1) shared by two target GO terms (i.e. two green 
rectangles in Fig. 1). The second group also employs IC, but 
methods in this group calculate IC from the number of GO 
terms, instead of using the number of annotated GPs [12]. 
The third group defines the term similarity by directly 
calculating the distance between two GO terms (with or 
without weights) [13]. The fourth group calculates 
functional similarity by normalizing the depth of NCA with 
the maximum depth of the entire GO graph [14]. 
While many approaches have been developed for GO 
term similarity measures, interestingly, contradicted 
performance has been reported in various studies [15-16],

which made it difficult for end users to choose metrics for 
their applications. Furthermore, lack of general guidelines 
for validating procedures impedes the fair comparisons 
among different methods. In this paper, we describe some 
evaluation guidelines that increase the intuitive 
interpretation of similarity scores through comprehensive 
evaluation processes. This includes comparisons of 
structure, phylogenetic profile and sequence similarities and 
biological/topological clusters. We compare five commonly 
used approaches for term similarity measures and discuss 
pitfalls and some open problems. In Section II, we detail the 
five methods. In Section III, comparison guidelines are 
discussed. Experimental results are presented in Section IV. 
We discuss limitations of current methods and also open 
problems in Section V.   
II. SIMILARITY MEASURE METHODS 
In this section, we introduce five methods for GO term 
similarity measures. Resnik’s method [9] uses information 
content of Nearest Common Ancestor (NCA), which is the 
closest node from leaf nodes or the farthest node from the 
root node shared by two GO terms, as the functional 
similarity of two GO terms. The final score is negative 
logarithm of the ratio between the number of annotated GPs 
corresponding to NCA of two GO terms goi and goj and 
total number of GPs associated with molecular function.

Resnik’s similarity, simResnik, is nonnegative. Due to 
the unlimited maximum boundary, interpreting the 
significance of similarity scores is not easy. Therefore, the 
score is normalized between 0 and 1 by using maximum and 
minimum value of the observations, which is defined as 
follows:

where GOnorm denotes normalized GO term similarity and 
GOsim(·) represents all observed GO term similarities.  
Schlicker et al. [10, 11] introduced relevance 
information by combining both Resnik and Lin’s [8] 
methods and the equation is defined by 
 
( ) ( )( ) ( ) ( ))(1loglog log2, NCApgopgop NCApgogosim jiji ??+

        (2) 
 
where p(goi) is  the probability of the i-th GO term 
calculated by the number of annotated GPs for goi, and 
p(NCA) is the probability of the NCA of goi and goj. The 
score is designed to be decreased when p(NCA) is increased. 
In other words, the final similarity score is rewarded or 
penalized based on the specificity of the NCA. 
As an edge-based method, Jiang and Conrath’s method 
calculates semantic distances rather than similarities by 
combining distance of two GO terms and the density of 
parent terms in GO graph [13]. The equation of this method 
is shown below.

In this equation, wi denotes the weight of i-th edge, which is 
one of edges connecting two GO terms goi and goj with the 
shortest distance. The weight of each edges is defined 
between a child node and its direct parent node, w(c,p). E(p) 
denotes number of edges from a parent node to its direct 
child nodes and is called a density of parent node. 
E denotes an average density in the entire GO graph. d(p) 
denotes depth of parent node and IC(c) and IC(p) are the 
information content (IC) at child node and parent node, 
respectively. T(c,p) is a link relation factor (i.e. ‘is-a’ and 
‘part-of’ relation) and is set to one for all relations. ? and ? 
are parameters to control the significance between depth and 
density factors with the optimal values of 0.5 and 0.3, 
respectively, as suggested in the original paper.  
To make diverse comparisons, methods using the 
probability of GO terms are also considered for evaluation. 
Gentleman’s method [12], which is also known as simUI, 
uses number of GO terms, instead of number of GPs. simUL 
is defined as the ratio between the number of GO terms 
belonging to the path from root node to NCA |path(root, 
NCA)| and the number of GO terms resulted in the union of 
all nodes belonging to the path from root node to each of 
GO terms, goi and goj,|path(root, goi) ? path(root, goj) |.

Finally, we consider Ye’s method [14], which focuses 
on the specificity of GO terms by directly adapting the 
relative depth of NCA into its similarity function.

This is the normalized depth of NCA in terms of the 
maximum and minimum depth of the entire functional GO 
terms in the DAG. 
Note that Eqs. 1-5 calculate similarity scores using the 
GO graph.  Resnik’s and Schlicker’s methods focus on the 
GO nodes, Ye’s and Gentleman’s scores emphasize edges, 
66
and Jiang and Conrath’s method considers both nodes and 
edges. Next, we discuss approaches to evaluate the five 
methods. 
III. EVALUATION METHODS 
To evaluate the performance of different metrics, we 
consider the use of the tendency of GP similarities in 
various forms. The hypothesis is that if genes or GPs are 
functionally similar, then the similarity calculated from 
baseline measurements including structure, sequence, and 
phylogenetic profiles will also show high similarities (to 
some degrees).  
We construct a large dataset for evaluation purposes. To 
get the annotations of each gene/GP in SCOP, high-quality 
truly domain-centric GO annotations are downloaded from 
Superfamily DB (http://supfam.cs.bris.ac.uk) [17] and 
integrated into our local database for information retrieval. 
Based on the annotation of SCOP domains at family level, a 
total of 2,690 unique domains are retrieved. Because 44 out 
of the 2,690 domains are annotated with non-existing GO 
terms in current GO, these domains are removed from the 
list. Finally a total number of 2,646 domains are obtained 
from SCOP, which lead to about 3.5 million unique domain 
pairs for further studies. 
The evaluation criteria are derived from three 
categories: sequence, phylogenetic profile and structure 
similarities. Sequence similarity is often used for identifying 
the inheritance of homology [18]. Although several 
limitations have been reported [19-21], homologous proteins 
identified by sequence similarities are likely to share similar 
functions, i.e., sequence similarity and functional similarity 
are likely to be correlated. To get the sequence similarities, 
all SCOP domain sequences are downloaded from ASTRAL 
[22] (http://astral.berkeley.edu/), and sequence similarities of 
all possible pairs of domains are calculated by BLAST [23] 
(http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) with default parameters.  
The rational behind phylogenetic profiles is from the 
hypothesis that functionally linked proteins are evolved in a 
correlated fashion; therefore the homologs of functionally 
related proteins can be found in the same subset of 
organisms [24]. The phylogenetic profiles are created by 
checking whether the homologs of proteins are present or 
absent in the same organism. To create phylogenetic 
profiles, psiBLAST searches homologs of target proteins 
against proteins from 25 fully sequenced genomes with e-
 value less than 10-10. The similarity of phylogenetic profiles 
between domains is calculated by mutual information as 
shown in Eq. 6., where x and y denote two vectors of 
phylogenetic profiles associated with any pairs of two 
domains. p(x,y) is a joint probability of two domains derived 
from four possible states of occurrences in which zero states 
absence and one denotes presence. p(x) and p(y) are 
marginal probability describing the probability of absence 
and presence of corresponding domains.

                      (6) 
The third criterion we use is to measure the correlations 
between the similarity metrics and structure similarities. 
This is based on the observations that knowledge of protein 
structures often provides a critical insight of protein 
functions. Indeed, protein structures are more conserved 
than sequences in evolutionary process [25]. This implies 
that the structural similarity has better characteristics to 
represent the functional relations between two proteins. To 
increase the relevance of measuring structural similarity, 
two different structural alignments are used: TM-align [26] 
and Dali [27]. Corresponding programs are downloaded 
from http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.edu/TM-align/ and 
http://ekhidna.biocenter.helsinki.fi respectively. 
Another criterion we use is clustering, which is utilized 
to measure the generalization capability of functional 
similarity measurement. The assumption is that if GPs 
having functionally close relations are projected into a 
network, then proteins categorized in similar functions 
should be closely located to each other in the network space. 
To compare the clustering performances, all domain pairs 
(about 3.5 million) are used as our test data. The given 
dataset includes a total of 215 class families (CF), 266 super 
families (SF), and 393 families (FA). It is well known that 
proteins in SCOP classification at the superfamily level tend 
to have common evolutionary origins and functional 
features. Thus, they are more likely to have similar 
functions. In our study, we choose the family level, which is 
even more specific than superfamily level (i.e., it is highly 
likely that the targeted GPs in the same family will belong 
to the same functional group [28, 29]). Therefore, our 
clustering task is to group GPs of the same SCOP family 
into a cluster. We construct a similarity network with each 
node representing a SCOP domain and each edge denoting 
the strength of functional similarity. Edges with similarity 
scores less than a preset threshold will be removed. By 
varying the threshold values, the similarity network can 
reach either maximum number of clusters or highest 
precision (the ratio of the number of correctly identified 
edges to the total number of identified edges), depending on 
the tasks on hand.  
IV. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS 
In order to evaluate different methods, correlations between 
each method and four base line similarities are compared, 
which are shown in Fig. 2, where the averaged similarities of 
TM-alignment, DALI, Sequence, and Phylogenetic profile 
are described as TM, Dali, Seq, and Phy respectively. 
Tendency curves by using matlab ‘polyfit’ function are 
drawn with solid lines and depicted as fitTM, fitDali, fitSeq, 
and fitPhy, corresponding to TM-alignment, DALI, 
Sequence, and Phylogenetic profile, respectively. As we can 
see that there is little correlation between Resnik’s, 
Gentlman’s, Jiangs metrics and sequence-, structure-, 
phylogenetic profile-based similarities. Schlicker’s metric 
correlates well with structure-based similarities when the 
degree of similarities is high (70% or higher). Overall, Ye’s 
method outperforms other methods and shows good 
67
correlations with the sequence, phylogenetic profile, and 
structure similarities. Since Ye’s method simply uses the 
normalized depth of NCA as its similarity function, the 
results may suggest that relative depth in a GO DAG may 
provide better information for term similarities. 
Alternatively, since node information may not be complete 
(e.g., unknown annotation for some gene products), the bias 
of node distributions may also contribute to the poor 
correlations shown with other methods. It is also worth 
mentioning that the correlation scores need not necessarily to 
be linear or propotional [30-33], however, if we test on a 
large dataset, the function similarities and sequence, 
structure, phylogenetic profile similarities are expected to be 
related to some degrees, especially for these highly similar 
GPs. One issue with Ye’s method though, is that its 
similarity values are often smaller than these calculated 
from other methods. This happens because Ye’s score only 
considers NCA and in our studies, most NCAs are identified 
closer to root GO term. It causes a problem, namely shallow 
problem, where many GO term pairs have identical 
similarity scores (if they share the same NCA or their NCAs 
have the same depth). This issue has also been reported by 
other studies [8, 13].

Figure 3. Maximum precision reached by each method 
 
To compare the clustering performances, 2646 domains 
in SCOP databases are used as test data. There are 215, 266, 
and 393 clusters for class families (CF), super families (SF), 
and families (FA), respectively. We compute the functional 
similarities of all possible combinations of SCOP domains. 
A threshold of similarity scores for each method is adjusted 
until it reaches the best performance (either it has maximum 
number of clusters or highest average precision). Fig. 3 
shows the maximum precisions that each method can reach 
with three different levels of domain families in SCOP 
classification. As can be seen, the maximum precisions are 
100% for Ye’s method, and more than 90% for other 
methods except for Jiang’s method, for the three categories 
CF, SF, and FA. However, we also observed that the average 
number of clusters that Ye’s method can identify is much 
smaller than other methods as well as the true number of 
clusters, i.e., Ye’s method misses many true edges (e.g., GPs 
belong to the same family).

V. DISCUSSIONS AND CONCLUSIONS 
One of the observations is the poor correlations between the 
various metrics and sequence, structure, and phylogenetic 
profile based similarities, which may result from several issues. 
Two well-documented issues are shadow and shallow 
problems. A shadow problem is one of the typical issues in 
similarity measures, which is caused by ignoring the details or 
fidelity of the target GO terms: terms located below a NCA 
will not contribute to similarity measures [4, 8]. A shallow 
problem is also reported as a significant defect in Jiang’s [13] 
and Lin’s [8] methods, which is caused by tendency of NCA 
location and the biased distributions of GPs. For example, 
when two sets of GO term pairs having same depth are 
considered, it is possible that the pair with a NCA near the root 
node has higher similarity score than the other pair with a NCA 
far away from the root node [16]. 
The incompleteness of current GO also causes problems: 
our knowledge about the roles of a gene or gene product in 
cellular life is still accumulating and evolving. Consequently, 
the terms and relations in GO are neither finite nor fully 
specified. Majority of the methods discussed here employ the 
information content (IC) as their major distributor to define 
functional similarity, which can be highly biased because of 
the incompleted genome and interest of studies particularly 
toward specific species and genomes. To make matters worse, 
the biased data do not necessarily guarantee to reflect the 
nature of gene or GPs. Therefore, IC may not be the best 
measure from biological point of view.  
Besides the evolving characteristics of GO, two more 
problems should be considered when information theory is 
considered as significant contributor to define functional 
similarities: GPs with no annotation and root shared GO 
terms. When we first started the study, GO database released 
at April 2011 was used as our master database.  The database 
showed a total of 9833 functional GO terms, in which 820 
terms were obsolete. Thus, we used 9013 GO terms. Due to 
the fact that most methods derived from information theory 
use IC to define functional similarity, it is interesting to see 
the distributions of GPs at individual GO terms. Surprisingly, 
we could not find any related studies on this issue. Although 
most studies use IC as a part of critical scoring functions, the 
fundamental sources of this score, i.e., the distributions of 
GPs, have not been reported yet. Simple statistics shows that 
2479 GO terms out of 9013 GO terms do not have any 
associated GPs, which means that only 6534 GO terms are 
actually meaningful in IC-based methods. Furthermore, more 
than half of meaningful GO terms have less than 50 GPs, 
many of them with less than five annotated GPs.  Accordingly, 
the IC-based methods are limited by GO terms without 
annotated GPs and with few annotated GPs.  
Herein root shared GO terms refer to GO terms with a 
NCA that is the root node. We call this problem as nil 
functional similarity problems because for most current 
methods no functional similarity is defined. We searched all 
possible GO term pairs and found that 52% of GO term pairs 
have root node as their NCAs, i.e. methods derived from IC 
and NCA-based methods cannot distinct the differences of GO 
terms or can mislead the results for more than half of all 
possible GO term pairs. To find out the biological relevance of 
using IC and NCA-based methods, we conduct the following 
experiment: protein-protein interaction (PPI) pairs associated 
with root shared GO terms are investigated from our KUPS 
database [35], which contains manually curated PPIs retrieved 
from IntAct, MINT, and HPRD. We report an interesting 
finding here. The example is about ribonuclease III activity 
(GO:0004525) and metal ion binding (GO:0046872), which 
are shared by root-node molecular function (GO:0003674). 
We retrieved 53 GPs from UniProt, which contain both 
GO:0004525 and GO0046872. These GPs are all associated 
with ‘dicer-like endoribonuclease’ proteins that cleave the 
phosphodiester bond within a polynucleotide chain and lead 
double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and pre-microRNA (miRNA) 
into short double-stranded RNA fragments called small 
interfering RNA (siRNA). As expected from their names, 
these enzymes share enzyme code (EC), 3.1.26.- which 
corresponds to ‘ribonuclease’. They also share a cofactor 
‘magnesium or manganese’. Apparently, GO:0004525 and 
GO:0046872 are highly related and should not be considered 
as nil functional similarity. Therefore, IC and NCA-based 
methods, which always treat root-shared GO terms equally, 
are limited in identifying groups of GPs that are functionally 
similar and have the root node as their NCA.  
In conclusion, while GO DAG is informative for 
annotating gene/GPs, measuring GO term similarities by using 
GO structure alone may be limited as we show in this paper. 
Several problems exist such as the evolving nature of GO and 
the nil functional similarities. The lack of strong correlations 
between current methods and sequence, structure, 
phylogenetic profile based similarities clearly demands new 
metrics for term similarity measures. One future direction is to 
integrate both the GO graph and existing biological 
knowledge into one single scoring metric. For example, RNA-
 Seq and protein structure data may provide direct evidence of 
similarity between two GPs and are complementary to 
information extracted from GO.
