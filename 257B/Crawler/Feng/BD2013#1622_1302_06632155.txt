 AbstractÑ Proliferation of data services has made it mandatory
 for operators to be able identify geographical regions with 3G
 connectivity discontinuity in a scalable and cost-efficient manner.
 The currently used methods for such analysis are either costly
 - such as in drive tests, partly unreliable - such as in network
 simulation approaches, or are not precise enough- such as in base
 station key performance indicators (KPI) based approaches. In
 this paper, towards addressing these inadequacies, we propose
 a 3G coverage analysis method that makes use of Óbig dataÓ
 processing schemes and the vast amounts of network data
 logged in mobile operators. In the proposed scheme, the BSSAP
 mobility and radio resource management messages between the
 BSS and MSC nodes of the operator network are processed to
 identify inter-technology handovers from 3G (WCDMA) access
 to 2G (EDGE, GPRS, GSM). Demonstrative examples show that
 the proposed mechanism produces accurate and precise results,
 outperforming the base station KPI-based approach.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 Digitization of content and emergence of wireless com-
 munication technologies which enable data transmission has
 placed mobile data services as an important revenue source for
 mobile operators. This trend has further been emphasized after
 the emergence of third generation (3G) networks (Wideband-
 CDMA in Europe), which have provided substantial gains in
 data speeds compared to 2G (EDGE, GPRS) technologies. On
 the customer side, the technological availability of high data
 rate connections has transformed the growing ÒdemandÓ for
 mobile data to a ÓneedÓ for Òany-time any-whereÓ connectivity.
 Therefore, providing ubiquitous and high quality (QoS) mobile
 data services, through data connectivity, has become priority
 for mobile operators in most parts of the world.
 A major challenge that needs to be addressed by the
 operators in this respect, is the discontinuity in 3G con-
 nectivity experienced by mobile users. Such discontinuity is
 experienced when the user is forced to handover from 3G
 connectivity down to 2G, possibly due to loss of signal quality.
 Such vertical handovers result in less efficient use of the
 spectrum - through low data rate connections - thus reducing
 the revenues from data services and also cause imperception
 regarding service quality on the customer side. It is therefore

 of utmost importance for operators to identify geographical
 regions with discontinuities in 3G connectivity.
 Identifying regions with 3G service discontinuity might
 prove to be challenging, as the coverage area for a typical
 3G transmitter does not only depend on signal path loss
 phenomena, but also on the overall planning and dimensioning
 of the surrounding 2G and 3G base stations. Furthermore, the
 coverage area is not always steady, as it is also influenced by
 the time varying band and channel characteristics as well as
 the instantaneous capacity demand in the cell, particularly in
 the case of 3G access. The traditional methods of identifying
 regions with 3G service discontinuity, such as drive-around
 tests and network simulations do not address the dynamics
 outlined above, and often are costly. Other methods making
 use of the base station KPI parameters that track 3G to 2G
 handovers often do not provide precise enough results, as
 they only include the signaling information that belongs to
 Òconnected modeÓ of mobile devices, ignoring the Òidle modeÓ
 dynamics that correspond to time intervals in which the mobile
 is silent. Therefore, there is need to develop coverage analysis
 methodologies that can accurately and precisely pinpoint ser-
 vice discontinuity in a cost efficient manner. Using big data
 processing platforms in telecommunication field is studied in
 different papers in the literature [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7].
 In this paper, inspired by the use of Òbig-dataÓ tools and
 concepts in diverse fields of study - such as customer-centric
 marketing, we propose a methodology making use of the vast
 amounts of signaling data that is constantly produced by the
 mobiles and fed back to the operator. In the context of a mobile
 operator, Òbig dataÓ refers to the collection of vast quantities
 of data that are being generated by mobile devices such as
 signaling and location data, web site visits, and several million
 CDRs (Call Detail Records) produced on a daily basis. In
 the scope of this paper, we propose to process the network
 logs for mobile uses, corresponding to both their idle and
 connected mode signaling data using the Hadoop platform [8],
 to come up with dynamic 3G service discontinuity maps. More
 specifically, mobility and radio resource management signaling
 data (BSSAP messages) collected by the probes attached to the
 relevant network switches are used. Through such data, the
 inter radio access technology handovers (IRAT HOs) from 3G
 to 2G for mobile users are mapped to geographical locations
 of the users to identify the 3G service discontinuity areas.
 Experimental results show that the service discontinuity areas
 achieved through this approach match the drive test results.
 Moreover, the approach provides more accurate results and
 provides a more detailed coverage map than the aforemen-
tioned methods based on tracking base station KPIs. The
 increase in accuracy is caused by the fact that such logs
 include both the ÒidleÓ and ÒconnectedÓ mode signaling data,
 as opposed to the latter alone. The increase in precision can be
 attributed to the fact that BSSAP messages provide destination
 information regarding a hand over, unlike the KPI parameters
 in a base station. The proposed system thus constitutes a
 scalable, accurate, and precise approach that captures the time-
 dynamicity of coverage analysis in a cost efficient manner.
 Besides the specifics and benefits of the analysis approach
 that it advocates, this paper also constitutes a contribution in
 the sense that it provides a nice example of combining results
 from the two seeming disjoint areas of research; namely the
 Òbig dataÓ processing schemes and coverage analysis tools.
 The mentioned fields have often been elaborated on separately,
 especially in the wireless cellular network domain. However,
 some of the results of one study area can readily be applied to
 the other, making it more powerful and efficient, as illustrated
 here.
 This paper is organized as follows: Section II provides the
 background for the proposed approach by providing a brief
 overview of traditional coverage analysis tools and of the
 concept of Òbig dataÓ. The section also details the proposed big
 data based coverage analysis method. Section III discusses the
 simulation results and finally Section IV gives the conclusions
 and future work.
 II. BIG DATA BASED COVERAGE ANALYSIS
 Establishing continuous 3G connectivity is important for
 operators, in achieving their aim of providing ubiquitous
 and high quality services for their customers. The undesired
 vertical handovers from 3G access are often results of falling
 RSSI (received signal strength indicator) or SNR (signal-to-
 noise-ratio) values below a certain threshold. In the case of
 3G access, the handovers are also triggered by instantaneous
 demand for excess capacity.
 Most coverage analysis methods considered in literature are
 based on drive tests and costly field measurements [9] [10].
 In 3GPP standardization effort, this work item goes by the
 name of Óminimization of drive testsÓ (MDT) [11]. In dynamic
 environments (due to population change, new base station
 deployments, the use of new services, outages, etc), new
 driving tests and field measurements need to be conducted
 on a periodic basis to have up-to-date info regarding the
 coverage areas and potential handovers likely to be triggered
 across technologies. Several other methods rely on statistical
 tools [12]. In these methods, Monte-Carlo simulations are
 utilized to mimic real network conditions and derive estimates
 for received signal strengths at different localities. Such meth-
 ods require high computational power and may also lack real
 network conditions.
 Mobile operators also make use of the base station KPI
 parameters for detecting vertical handovers. The parameters
 corresponding to 3G IRAT HO (Inter Radio Access Tech-
 nology Handovers) give an indication of the tendency of the
 mobile associated with a certain base station to experience
 outbound handovers from 3G access thus aiding the coverage
 analysis. Such parameters, however, suffer two major limita-
 tions: (i) they include handovers associated with connected-
 mode signaling only, and (ii) they only give an indication of
 ÒoutboundÓ handovers, without specifying the destination base
 station in case the mobile changes the point of connection
 as well. Thus, an analysis based on such parameters fails to
 consider the idle-mode handovers, limiting the sampling space.
 It also misses geographical precision, as the lack of knowledge
 regarding destination base stations avoids pinpointing cells
 where 3G access is not adequate.
 A cost-effective coverage analysis, that provides an accurate
 and precise identification of regions with 3G service discon-
 tinuity can be implemented through making use of the vast
 quantities of customer device data continuously collected by
 the operator- often classified as Òbig dataÓ, as outlined in the
 sections that follow.

 A. ÒBig- DataÓ and Hadoop Platform
 Technically, ÒBig dataÓ refers to huge quantities of data that
 are so large, that it is practically not possible to process them
 using the readily available tools. Vast amounts of data that
 accumulates at companies as a result of their daily operations
 can be considered in this category. The analysis of big data
 is a central and important activity in a variety of fields such
 as finance, telecommunications, transportation and the like.
 Most high-technology companies such as Yahoo, Facebook,
 Google as well as many smaller companies are now processing
 terabyte-scale data processing on a regular basis.
 The major technical challenge regarding big data is that
 it is not economically sound to store and process such
 data at its entirety, as the traditional analysis techniques are
 computationally expensive. To this end, advanced processing
 platforms specialized at handling big data, such as Oracle
 DB2, Microsoft PDW, EMC Greenplum, Teradata, Vertiva and
 Hadoop have recently been developed. Such platforms help
 lower the cost of storage, enhance computation and memory
 allocation.
Among the available platforms, Hadoop stands out as the
 most notable one as it is an open source solution. It is made
 up of a storage module, namely HDFS (Hadoop Distributed
 File System) and a computation module, namely MapReduce.
 Whereas HDFS can have centralized or distributed implemen-
 tations, MapReduce inherently has a distributed structure that
 enables it to execute jobs in parallel on multiple nodes.
 B. Operator Data and Usage for Coverage Analysis
 Mobile operators typically are experiencing vast quantities
 of data that are being generated both by customer mobile
 devices (smartphones, laptops, etc) as well as various network
 elements present in their core networks (like MSC (Mobile
 Switching Center), MGW (Media Gateway), HLR (Home
 Location Register), etc), as illustrated in Fig 1. User generated
 data also include several million CDRs essentially processed
 on a daily basis, and includes information regarding phone
 calls, text messages, web site visits, online mobile banking
 transactions. Traditionally, among such huge quantity of data,
 only those related to billing, charging and similar customer
 relations functions are utilized by the operator. Data originat-
 ing from network elements is often not considered in efforts
 to understand the user experience.
 Such data can in fact be used to track inter-technology
 handovers. Number of such handovers in different localities
 are instrumental in identifying regions with interruptible 3G
 services. Towards this end, connected mode data inherent in
 the inter-node signalling in the form of IRAT HO (inter radio
 acess technology handover) indicators as well as the idle-mode
 data that corresponds to time intervals in which the mobile is
 silent can be utilized. An important source of such data in the
 operator network is the interface between the BSC and MSC
 nodes (also referred to as the ÒA-interfaceÓ), as also indicated
 in Fig. 1. The BSSAP messages that go through this interface
 provide the data needed to identify intertechnology handovers.
 The BSSAP messages are mobile device based and include
 numerous indicators related to resource management, hand
 over control and mobility management. Among these numer-
 ous indicators, the four fields that are relevant in identify-
 ing inter-technology handovers are the location update fields
 namely ÒLAC servingÓ, ÒLast LAC targetÓ, ÒBSSAP proce-
 dureÓ and ÒLast Cell IDÓ . LAC (location area code) serving
 field corresponds to the previous location area information
 of a mobile before location update and Last LAC/Last Cell
 ID target are the location area/cell information the mobile is
 currently attached to when the location update messages are
 sent. It is important to note that the location area information
 inherent in the LAC serving and Last LAC target fields also
 indicate the radio access technologies utilized by the mobile
 in the considered location areas.
 The field value ÒBSSAP procedure = Update locationÓ
 is indicative of handovers by users who reselect cells due
 to poor or lack of 3G coverage. Switch on or off actions,
 or 3GPP protocol enforced periodic location updates and
 mobility based location updates when a mobile moves from
 one location area into another in idle mod are also potential
 triggers. Thus, both idle mode and dynamic mode dynamics
 are captured in location updates. A joint analysis which takes
 into account previous and current location information reveals
 inter-technology handovers. The number of such handovers
 is indicative of 3G service discontinuity in the considered
 geographical location. It is also important to note that in
 such analysis, the cell id to which the mobile switches to 2G
 access can precisely be identified, providing the geographical
 precision that is missing in base station KPI parameters.

 C. Coverage Evaluation Methodology Based on Big Data
 A high level description of the proposed methodology that
 makes use of the A-interphase data is presented in Fig. 2.
 The proposed process for near-real time coverage performance
 evaluation methodology contains the following steps:
 1) Data flows from cellular network to Hadoop distributed
 data warehouse (Hive), and is loaded into HDFS,
 2) The data is queried with Hive in order to count all
 handovers (such as from 3G to 2G). Hive transforms
 the query to MapReduce functions implicitly,
 3) Results are transferred to MySQL database
 4) Relevant information from database is queried using
 SQL for only handovers from 3G to 2G. (This query can
 also be merged with the second step, but we decided to
 get all the handovers in order to not constraint ourself
 on specific IRAT HOs)
 5) Coverage results are monitored on the web based GUI
 over google maps for the desired IRAT HO.
 In step 1, the four relevant fields of LAC serving, Last
 LAC target, BSSAP procedure and Last Cell ID are loaded
 onto the Hadoop platform. In step 2, only those entries for

 which there are location updates (ÒBSSAP procedure = Update
 locationÓ) are determined, using the query in Table I. In step
 4, the location updates are jointly considered with previous
 and current location information to identify handovers from
 3G using the query in Table II. The Last Cell ID target field
 pinpoints the geographical locality of the handover. Note that
 high level query languages such as Pig Latin, Hive or Jaql can
 be used to express complex analysis tasks. Using extensions,
 queries are converted into MapReduce jobs. In the scope of
 this work, Hive was used for querying the network data in
 parallel.
 III. EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION
 The accuracy and precision of the proposed mechanism was
 tested in AveaÕs network. Towards this purpose, a prototype
 was implemented along the lines outlined in the previous
 section. A data processing platform was implemented through
 Hadoop on three nodes, with computations powers correspond-
 ing to INTEL 2 ? 1 CORE CPU, 8 GB RAM, 500 GB hard
 disk.
 The platform was fed with AVEAÕs A-interface data, which
 receives up to 1 Million messages a day that are generated and
 transmitted from different network elements in different parts
 of the network. The experimental demo was run on a sample
 set of data, that corresponds to 19-th to 20-th November 2012

 more than 64 GB in size and has a total of over 2 million
 rows of signalling and communicating information.
 Representative results of the coverage analysis are presented
 in Fig. 3, which shows the web-based Graphical User Interface
 (GUI) of the prototype that allows monitoring the IRAT HOs.
 Fig. 3 (a) provides a screen shot of 3G coverage analysis map
 for a specific site IS1945 in Turkey, while Fig. 3(b) shows the
 corresponding area as it is analyzed through the base station
 based KPI. Fig. 3 (c) provides the results of the roadtest as
 benchmark. The hand over counts specify the color of the
 discontinuity spot. As can clearly be seen from the figures,
 the proposed method yields results that are in coherence with
 the drive tests, and are thus accurate. The comparison between
 the proposed method and the KPI based approach reveals that
 the proposed method provides greater precisions, identifying
 areas with service discontinuity that are not discovered by the
 latter method. These representative results demonstrate that
 inclusion of idle mode signaling data and target cell id info
 increases the quality of the coverage analysis.
 IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
 In this paper, we have proposed a 3G coverage analysis
 method that identifies 3G service discontinuity areas by pro-
 cessing BSSAP signaling data through the Hadoop based big
 data processing methods. The proposed method identifies the
 location updates that correspond to inter-technology handovers
 and uses the target Cell ID provided to precisely identify
 geographic locality where there are 3G service discontinuities.
 The experimental results suggest that the proposed mechanism
 produces accurate results, and provide precision gains as
 opposed to traditionally employed methods. The approach
 displayed in this paper is a nice example demonstrating the use
 of big data concepts in increasing the efficiency of network
 operations in mobile operators. As future work, we aim to
 enhance the proposed method to enable near-real time analysis.
