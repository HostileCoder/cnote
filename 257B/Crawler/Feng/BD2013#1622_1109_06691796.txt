 Abstract—This paper researches on Matthew Effect in Sina
 Weibo microblogger. We choose the microblogs in the ranking
 list of Hot Microblog App in Sina Weibo microblogger as target
 of our study. The differences of repost number of microblogs
 in the ranking list between before and after the time when it
 enter the ranking list of Hot Microblog app are analyzed. And
 we compare the spread features of the microblogs in the ranking
 list with those hot microblogs not in the list and those ordinary
 microblogs of users who have some microblog in the ranking
 list before. Our study proves the existence of Matthew Effect in
 social network.
 I. INTRODUCTION
 Microblog is a new media that appears and develops rapidly
 in recent years. A user can create posts no more than 140
 words, which contain links, videos or pictures, to share inter-
 esting things with his or her fans. Sina Weibo is one of the
 largest microblog websites in China. Now it has more than 400
 million registered users, 300 thousand of which are verified
 users. 9% of its users are active users and about 100 million
 posts are created one day.
 Matthew Effect is an positive feedback phenomenon in
 which “the richer gets richer and the poorer gets poorer”[1].
 In social network, Matthew Effect is a common phenomenon.
 Nowadays, many content clustering systems try to cluster the
 hot topics in current social network and recommend them to
 users, which makes them more possible for users to know
 and repost so that they become hotter. For example, when
 searching some keywords in Sina Weibo1, you can find a list
 of recent hot words just on your right-hand side. When visiting
 someone’s homepages, you would see a list of hot microblogs
 from the Hot Microblog App 2 . And as mentioned earlier,
 Sina Weibo microblogger has provided an App called “Hot
 Microblog” which has a ranking list of microblogs accord-
 ing to its hot degree of recent 24 hours. Users can repost,
 comment on and enjoy hot microblogs of different fields and
 different time. The existence of those content clustering and
 recommendation systems give more chances for hot topics or
 microblogs to be exposed which would in return gives them
 larger increase in repost amount.

 Recent researches imply that information spread in social
 network depends on the influence of the creator[2] and its
 novelty[3]. Some work is done on influence maximization in
 social network[4]. Previous work has proves that decaying
 visibility among the timeline on one’s homepage[5]. We prove
 the existence of Matthew Effect in social network and its role
 on influencing the information spread.
 We firstly compare the spread of those hot microblogs from
 the ranking list before they enter the ranking list with that
 after they enter. Secondly, their spread features are compared
 with spread of those microblogs which have not been in the
 list. And our research proves the existence of Matthew Effect
 in social network.
 II. EMPIRICAL STUDY
 Sina Weibo provides many apps such as Hot Microblog,
 Hot Topic and so on. The user can repost them to show their
 opinions. We mainly treat microblogs in the ranking list of
 Hot Microblog as our target, and study the difference of spread
 between before and after the time when they enter the ranking
 list and the difference of spread of hot microblogs which have
 been in the ranking list from those microblogs which have not
 been in the ranking list.
 A. Data collection
 Our dataset mainly has 3 parts: hot microblogs in the
 ranking list, hot microblogs not in the ranking list and ordinary
 microblogs whose owner has one or more microblogs in the
 ranking list.
 • Hot microblogs in the ranking list. We everyday fetch the
 first 100 microblog from the ranking list of the recent
 24 hours in Hot Microblog. It lasts from 29th March
 to 7th April for about 10 days. In all we fetched 1669
 microblogs, from which we choose those that rank top 30
 as this part. There are 461 microblogs in all. We denote
 this part as ONLIST461.
 • Hot microblogs which are not in the ranking list. There
 are some celebrities in Sina Weibo, who are restricted or
 not recommended for some reason or another. However,
 their microblogs can also have large amount of reposts.
 We choose from microblogs of those users with large

Fig. 1: Distribution of reposts number over 24 hours
 repost number as this part. We get 100 microblogs in all,
 denoted as OFFLIST100.
 • Ordinary microblogs whose owner has one or more
 microblogs in the ranking list. For those users who have
 one or more microblogs in the ranking list ,we choose
 their 100 recent microblogs. Filter out those microblogs
 that have been in the ranking list and those with reposts
 number larger than 7000 and smaller than 5000. At last
 we have 471 microblogs as this part and it is denoted as
 OFFLIST471.
 The second and third parts are separately the hot and
 ordinary microblogs which are not in the ranking list. So they
 can be used as the representative of the microblogs that are
 not in the ranking list. At last, for all the microblogs, we use
 Sina Weibo Open API to fetch all of their reposts. And we
 get more than 12 million reposts.
 B. Data analysis
 1) Distribution of reposts over 24 hour: We calculate the
 distribution of reposts over 24 hours in one day for the three
 parts of our dataset. Then they are normalized by being divided
 with the total number of reposts of relevant part.
 Figure 1 shows that for those microblogs in OFFLIST100
 and OFFLIST471, they have two peaks around 9:00 and
 22:00 separately. However, those in ONLIST461 have their
 reposts number more averagely distributed. The microblogs
 in OFFLIST100 and OFFLIST471 are ordinary microblogs
 and reposted mainly through the friends network. So their
 frequency can be on half of the distribution of one ordinary
 microblogs. It shows the influence of time in one day on the
 repost action. One obvious result is that more reposts appear
 in the daytime than at night. In more detail, at 9:00, it is the
 time that people begin one day’s work. They tend to check
 their microblogs. And at 22:00, it is the time before bedtime.
 People check their microblogs to relax. So in these moments,
 it is more possible for an repost to appear. However, those
 microblogs in ONLIST461 are more exposed since they are
 in the ranking list. At other time, people have more ways to
 have access to it and so they have larger parts of reposts than
 those microblogs in OFFLIST100 and OFFLIST471.
 Regarding this frequency as the correction factor, we can
 reduce the influence of time in one day on the distribution and

 µ 1.53 2.91 5.15 7.61 9.27 8.66 4.81 2.48

 hour 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23
 µ 1.81 1.64 1.59 1.53 1.30 1.10 1.00 1.18
 Fig. 2: Distribution of corrected repost number
 (onlist461hx means xh ≤ T < (x + 2)h)
 get closer to the nature of the Matthew Effect. Specifically,
 we correct the repost number using the following method.
 Let RCi{i = 0, 1, 2...23} be the repost number of those
 microblogs in OFFLIST100 and OFFLIST471 in hour i. Then
 the correction factor µi = max(RCi)/RCi. And the corrected
 repost number of microblog with original repost number RC
 is RC ? µi. The correction factors are shown in Table I.
 2) Distribution of corrected repost number of hot mi-
 croblogs: For every microblog in ONLIST461, we calculate
 the interval T between the time when this microblog enters the
 ranking list and its create time. Divide those microblogs into
 12 categories every two hours of T from 0h to 24h (since the
 ranking list is of the recent 24 hours, there is no microblogs
 with T > 24 hours). Consider the corrected repost number of
 the microblogs in different categories.
 Figure 2 shows that after a few miniutes the time when
 entering the ranking list, the microblogs have an obvious
 increase in the corrected repost number per 10 minutes, which
 means that the event of entering ranking list would bring more
 reposts to them to make them hotter. When a new microblog
 enters the ranking list, since many people have not seen it yet,
 it is likely to have the largest repost number per 10 minutes.
 These microblogs enter the ranking list because they have large
 amounts of reposts. And in return, being in the ranking list
 gives them larger repost number per unit time.
 Another point is that repost number per 10 minutes of these
 hot microblogs all decline sharply at about 24 hours after they
 enter the list. This is because the list is dynamically updated to
 ensure the microblogs in the list is the hot microblogs of recent
 24 hours. And after 24 hours, the microblogs are pushed off
 the list and deprived of the privilege of being more exposed.
 So being in the list brings more reposts than not.

 3) Distribution of corrected repost number of the three
 parts: The correction by the factors in the subsection II-B1
 would help us see the Matthew Effect clearly without the
 influence of the normal period of people’s life. In order to
 discover the influence of being on the ranking list, we compare
 the corrected repost number of the three parts of our dataset.
 Figure 3 shows that about 24 hours after their create time,
 those microblogs in ONLIST461 have sharp declining in their
 repost number per 10 minutes. However, this phenomenon
 is not so obvious for those microblogs in OFFLIST100 and
 especially OFFLIST471. The reason of this phenomenon is
 that those microblogs are all from the 24-hour ranking list
 and after about 24 hours, they are pushed off the ranking list
 and lose their privileges over other ordinary microblogs. This
 proves the great effect of entering the ranking list.
 4) The percentage of the first-level reposts: The first-level
 reposts of a source microblog m are the reposts which repost
 microblog m directly, not those reposts which are the reposts
 of others. Those people who check the ranking list usually
 discover the source microblogs directly. The reposts brought
 by appearing in the ranking list are mostly first-level reposts.
 So analysis of first-level repost is indispensable. We define the
 percentage pfl as the percentage of the first-level reposts of
 one microblog m over all its reposts. In this part, we would
 compare the percentage of the first-level reposts pfl to see the
 influence of entering the ranking list.
 Figure 4 shows that for those microblogs in OFFLIST471
 and OFFLIST100, their pfl generally decline averagely. How-
 ever, for those microblogs in ONLIST461, their pfl have an
 obvious increase when they enter the ranking list and an sharp
 decline when they are pushed off the ranking list. This is
 because users always directly repost this microblog when they
 see it in the ranking list and so this part of reposts is mainly
 first-level reposts. Those users who do not see the microblog
 in the ranking list mostly repost the reposts of their followees.
 Again this proves that appearing in the ranking list would
 bring more reposts to make hot microblogs hotter and that is
 the proof of existence of Matthew Effect.
 III. CONCLUSION
 This paper mainly studies hot microblogs in the ranking
 list of Hot Microblog App in Sina Weibo microblogger. After
 removing the influence of normal period of people’s life, we
 find that microblogs would have an increase in reposts number
 per unit time when they enter the ranking list and an decline
 when they are pushed off the list. When seeing the microblog
 in the ranking list of Hot Microblog App, users tend to repost it
 directly. And that is the cause of the same variation tendency
 of ratio of first-level reposts as the reposts number per unit
 time. We prove the existence of Matthew Effect from different
 aspects. In social network, hot topics or microblogs are always
 recommended to users which in return makes it hotter. And
 that is Matthew Effect.
 IV. FUTURE WORK
 We studies on Matthew Effect in Sina Weibo microblogger.
 For those microblogs that have been in the ranking list, how
 many percentage of reposts number is brought by Matthew
 Effect? This is problem worth studying. We will model the
 spread of microblogs before they enter the ranking list and
 after that time. On the other hand, the dataset now is not so
 enough and future work will be done on more data.
