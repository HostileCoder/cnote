 Abstract—This paper reports the conclusions of the panel on
 “The role of network analysis and mining in the era of big
 data” held during the 2013 ASONAM conference. The panel
 was charged with the responsibility of determining one or two
 big open problems that require a significant investment of time,
 effort, and resources over a five year period.
 I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
 During the 2013 ASONAM conference (Niagara Falls,
 Canada, August 2013), the author was charged with the task of
 holding a panel discussion on the role of network analysis and
 mining during the era of big data. This brief paper summarizes
 the final conclusions of the panel.
 II. CHARGE TO THE PANEL
 The panel was directed to answer a single question. As
 social media proliferates throughout the world (over 400M
 tweets per day, over 4.5B likes per day on Facebook, over 100
 hours of video uploaded per minute on YouTune), there is an
 ever-growing interest in leveraging this rich treasure trove of
 user-provided data for commercial, military, and government
 purposes. For instance, these channels were used during the
 recent Arab Spring revolutions that overthrew dictators in
 Tunisia and Libra. These same channels are used by marketers
 to understand who likes or dislikes their products and why,
 while political analysts use this same data to identify how
 well political candidates are doing and which issues resonate
 with voters. Government agencies watch these social media
 channels to identify planned protests, sympathizers of terrorist
 groups, and other planned criminal activity.
 The charge to the panel was simple: Identify one or two
 major roadblocks that prevent us from effectively analyzing
 this enormous quantity of big data and leveraging it as well as
 we could. What single roadblocks remain from a technological
 perspective in enabling a wide range of applications that could
 benefit from this data? We asked panelists to identify major
 scientific problems — those that will, in all likelihood, take
 a community of researchers a total of approximatelt 5 years
 to solve assuming a strong and directed effort to fund such
 research programs.
 In order to answer this question, the panel was asked to
 deliberate on the following questions:
 1) What applications of network analysis and data min-
 ing have you seen applied to “big data” style prob-
 lems in business and government?
 2) In such applications, how did the organizations col-
 lect the “big data” ? Did they have them already? Or
 did they have to pro-actively collect them?
 3) What kinds of benefits did these organizations get
 from network analysis and mining of“big data”?
 How did they establish a value proposition for their
 customers and management?
 4) Are there cases in which network analysis and data
 mining did not deliver stellar results – and if so, why?
 5) What are organizations looking for in terms of net-
 work analysis and data mining that current technol-
 ogy falls short on? What are the critical obstacles to
 be overcome?
 The panel consisted of the following individuals:
 1) Prof. Kathleen Carley (Carnegie Mellon University)
 2) Prof. Christos Faloutsos (Carnegie Mellon Univer-
 sity)
 3) Prof. Huan Liu (Arizona State University)
 4) Prof. Jaideep Srivastava (University of Minnesota)
 5) Dr. Mohammed Rifaie (Royal Bank of Canada)
 III. PRINCIPAL RECOMMENDATION
 The principal recommendation of the panel was to establish
 targeted, well funded research programs to answer the Identify
 Fact or Fiction (IFF) problem.
 As the world becomes awash in ever-increasing quantities
 of data generated by crowds, there is a huge potential for the
 world to also become awash with:
 1) Inadvertently erroneous data. For instance, ac-
 cording to NBC News, false rumors on Wikipedia
 included ridiculous statements saying a recent British
 Prime Minister loved Hitler, and a famour living US
 senator had died 1. While these comments did not
 cause grave harm, they can be expected to com-
 promise the integrity of applications that use social
 media.
 2) Deliberately false and misleading data. For in-
 stance, in 2011, a false rumor that a leading CNN
 personality was suspended lit up Twitter. In 2013, a
 hacked Associated Press account was used to spread
 the deliberately false rumor that an explosion had
 1http://www.nbcnews.com/id/32588168/ns/technology and science-tech
 and gadgets/t/biggest-wikipedia-blunders/#.Ujber3ev-68
rocked the White House, leading to huge amounts
 of panicked financial transactions in world stock
 markets.
 The Identify Fact or Fiction (IFF for short) problem is one
 that performs the following steps:
 1) Gather relevant data. Given a proposition p (e.g.
 “Person X was suspended today by CNN”), the
 IFF problem would first identify all data Data(p)
 about the proposition p available through the big data
 collections (e.g. Facebook, Twitter) available.
 2) Assemble evidence. From the relevant data about p,
 two pieces of evidence would be assembled: evidence
 supporting p and evidence invalidating p. Appropriate
 structures would need to be developed in order to
 identify, store, and manipulate such evidence.
 3) Assess evidence. The evidence would need to be
 assessed in order to understand the strength and
 weakness of each body of evidence and then arrive
 at a probability that the proposition p in question is
 correct.
 In order to execute these steps, a huge amount of re-
 search would be needed in social network analysis, in natural
 language processing and machine translation, in sentiment
 analysis, in database management systems, in artificial intelli-
 gence, and all of these pieces would need to come together
 in a seamless “whole” in order to address such problems
 effectively.
 The panel accordingly recommended that the IFF problem
 be made an urgent priority for research and development, both
 within academia and industry. The panel further recommends
 that appropriate national funding agencies fund such an effort
 through the creation of targeted research programs.
