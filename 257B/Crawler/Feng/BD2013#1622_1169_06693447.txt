Abstract—When using mobile phones, credit cards, electronic 
mail, browsing social networks etc., contemporary consumers 
leave behind thousands of digital footprints. Each footprint 
reflects actual actions that we take in given place and time. The 
analysis of thousands of such footprints conducted among large 
groups of people allows us to examine human behaviour on a 
scale that has never been imagined in scientific studies 
concerning psychology and sociology. The results of those 
analyses already have a significant influence on contemporary 
management, especially when it comes to new business 
opportunities in companies that employ business models based on 
the one-to-one relations with their customers. Nevertheless, this 
outstanding opportunity implies an enormous privacy problem. 
We will illustrate this issue by an empirical research based on the 
data gathered from Facebook, where users are using privacy 
controls that allow displaying their content only to a selected 
group of people. Users of such controls will likely continue 
positing more, even as their network grows or becomes sparser. 
We test these predictions using a dataset from Facebook gathered 
from a sample of college students and find statistical support for 
them. Our conclusions are that individuals are relatively prudent 
and are actually very aware of the social norms. 
Keywords: big data analysis, social netwrok sites, privacy problem 
 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
The analysis of digital footprints (credit card transactions, 
mobile phone calls, e-mails replays, RFID mass transit cards, 
movements captured by GPS in smart devices, blog post, 
“likes” in social networks sites, etc.) that reflect human 
behaviour is a particularly important factor that stimulates 
paradigm shifts with in the business management,  which is 
focusing on extensive data-based decisions making by 
employing detailed and in-depth information on customers. 
Access to extensive, real-time volumes of behavioural 
customers data, with special regard to their social relationships, 
becomes a basis for the development of advanced analytical 
customer management systems. One of their most important 
elements are social relationships and interactions between 
customers associated with integration of social networks sites 
with a corporate information systems. The ongoing research 
seems to support the hypothesis by Petland [1] on the so called 
‘honest signals’, which may be paraphrased as follows: ”the 
analysis of digital footprints, reflecting actual behaviour of 
people, allows us to foresee their future actions, providing data 
that may be used for business purposes”. In business practice, it 
gives a possibility to build an analytical customer profiles [2], 
that is a result of mining the time series of customer 
transactional data, as well as other social-demographic data  in 
order to generate additional business value. In the current 
approaches, the customer profile is developed and used in 
marketing campaign management systems. The company 
possesses a local data warehouse and limits profile creation to 
customer data analysis accepted by law. In this approach the 
customer is not informed about data processing that concerns 
him. In this scenario, a customer analytical profile is a property 
of the company. The new emerging trend is that selected 
elements of customer profile start to be traded between 
companies. The companies exchange information on customer 
behaviours and customers may be informed about data 
processing and exchanging and they can use loyalty and benefit 
programs. In this approach, the analytical customer profile 
becomes a joint property of companies participating in the 
program [2]. Such applications of big data analysis have an 
enormous business potential, but at the same time raise 
justified questions about protection of personal data. 
 
II. PRIVACY ISSUE 
 The problem of privacy associated with digital footprint 
registration has in fact two dimensions. The first one is of 
business character and is associated with the use of customer 
data to adjust product and/or service offer to the customers’ 
needs. Such a situation raises the so-called Privacy Paradox [3]. 
There is a natural contradiction between customers’ will to 
protect their personal data and their will to receive personalised 
marketing messages. The two conditions cannot be met at the 
same time. Hence, paradoxically, a customer may agree upon 
transferring their private data and even contribute to the 
process of profile building,  in exchange for  special offers, 
bonuses, discounts, promotions, etc. Another dimension of the 
privacy issue is associated with the customers personal life, 
when companies gain access to particularly sensitive data that 
go beyond standard customer behaviours and concern e.g. the 
moral sphere. In this case, the paradox arises from the fact that 
every individual has a right to not disclose their personal data, 
but at the same time there is virtually no possibility to live in 
the modern world without using mobile phones, credit cards or 
the Internet. The issue seems of even greater importance, given 
the fact that the registered data may be stored without any time 
restrictions. Thus, our past actions may impact the present, but 
also distant future, affecting even our great-grandchildren [4].   
It may be stated that the notion of privacy has a great 
importance for our life and business model development in the 
era of digital economy [5][6].  It was decided to examine this

important phenomenon based on the behavioural data gathered 
via Facebook, a popular on-line social network site. 
Fundamental features to the experience on Facebook are a 
person’s newsfeed which is a personalized feed of his or her 
friends updates. Facebook requires the user to identify 
themselves authentically. The profile displays information 
about the individual he or she has chosen to share, including 
interests, education and work background and contact 
information. Facebook also includes core applications – 
photos, events, videos, groups, and pages – that let people 
connect and share in rich and engaging ways. Users can 
communicate with one another through chat, personal 
messages, wall posts, pokes, or status updates. Additionally 
Facebook users have a control over the profile visibility and 
on-line activity.  
Related work on the privacy issue in Facebook is widely 
presented in Stutzman et al. [7] and  Ibrahim et al. [8] papers. 
The research group consisted of college students. The choice 
of this particular research group was not accidental, since 
potentially, young people display less interest in personal data 
protection on a social networking site. The main goal of the 
research was to examine to what extent the users employ 
privacy settings and the influence of such actions on their 
behaviours. 
 
III. RESEARCH SETTINGS AND DATA COLLECTION 
Kevin Lewis presented a use of a longitudinal dataset 
combined with network modeling to examine the co-evolution 
of college students friendships and privacy behavior on 
Facebook [9]. He found significant degree effects on students 
privacy behavior, where students with larger networks are 
more likely to have a private profile. Private here mean 
“separate “ from strangers. In this context we can formulate 
the following hypothesis:  
 
“The increase in the number of friends will increase the 
likelihood of posting status updates where the users are using 
privacy settings”  
 
We decided to carry out a two-stage empirical study. The 
first stage is to determine to which extent the users of social 
network sites deliberately use privacy controls. This stage will 
be carried out with the use of descriptive statistics. Second 
stage, on the other hand, is to determine the influence that the 
usage of privacy controls have on the users’ activity. This 
study is corresponding to the Piskorski social strategy theory 
[10]. 
In spring 2011 the Warsaw School of Economics students 
were invited to participate in research experiment. No course 
credit was and students were not compensated for the study. 
We did, however, offer a free participation in the workshop on 
social media in business applications. We created the project 
webpage which described the project in complete detail 
including the Graph API protocol description, that is officially 
supported by Facebook. The Graph API presents a simple, 
consistent view of the Facebook social graph, uniformly 
representing objects in the graph (e.g., people, photos, events, 
and pages) and the connections between them (e.g., friend 
relationships, shared content, and photo tags). Every object in 
the social graph has a unique identifier. After two weeks 
advertising campaign (e-mails, newsletter, students journals, 
etc.)  at Warsaw School of Economics we received a positive 
response from 272 Facebook users. The received data were 
anonymized and the whole study was organized in the way to 
avoid the selection bias in study participation. Our research is 
based on the 214 active users having the following 
characteristics (those data are based on the survey answers): 
age (18-26 years old) – 71%, sex (men) - 51 %, education 
(college student) – 75%, location (city more than 1 million 
population) – 72%. We started to download all available data 
provided by Graph API excluding chat conversation data since 
June 2011. The data presented in this study were collected in 
August 2011, two months before the date, when Facebook 
lunched his new privacy policy introducing pre-defined user 
groups. 
In order to conduct the regression analysis the three kinds 
of variables were established from data provided by Graph 
API: 
 Dependent variable – user  has an opportunity to 
create content (update status, post a picture, etc.), that 
is posted to a user Wall (timeline). Then Facebook 
automatically is generating a News Feed story so that 
the next time user friends log into Facebook, they see 
the content the specific uses shared on their 
homepage. It is possibility control the visibility of 
these stories by using the audience selector. By 
means of a dropdown menu it is possible to choose 
who an user want to share a post with. To capture 
user activity we constructed the dependent variable 
Self posts. This variable is defined by a number of 
posts (the possible post types are: photo, status, link, 
video, check in, music, flash object) that a specific 
user published on his Wall during an experiment 
period, and are available to read and comment by his 
friends. 
 Independent variable - we took into account the size 
of the social network that is straightforward measured 
by the Friends number variable. This variable is 
measure by a total  number of items on the friends 
list. 
 Control variables - we included two types of control 
variables: user demographics controls and a measure 
of users interactions. First, we controlled for user 
demographics data by including a binary variable 
Sex. Second we controlled for the interactions to a 
specific users from his friends by Others posts 
variable. This variable is measure by a number of 
posts published on an user Wall by his friends. 
 
Unfortunately, due to Graph API restriction,  it was impossible 
to download the whole friends network of our experiment 
participants. Due to this restriction we were not able to 
calculate more advanced social network analysis measures like 
956
density. Anyway the results presented in the next chapter are 
promising. 
 
IV. RESULTS 
Almost 75% (160 on 214) of the participants were 
conscious about privacy setting and they created they own 
private friends lists. Those results are quite similar to the boyd 
and Hargittai survey research on Facebook privacy setting [11]. 
Table I reports the descriptive statistics and correlations 
between variables. The average number of friends is 263. The 
largest correlation coefficient between two independent 
variables is .205 (between Friends number and Other posts. 
The reason that those two variables are relatively highly 
correlated is that in bigger social networks there is higher 
probability of  receiving a post from others. It is worth 
mentioning the significant (at the .01 level) correlation between 
the Sex and Other Posts variables, that interpretation is that 
 women are receiving posts their Wall from others in opposite 
to men. There is a very intriguing negative correlation 
(significant on the .05 level) between Self Posts and Other 
Posts variables. It means that an intensive activity of the 
specific subject is not influencing directly others activity on the 
subject Wall. It should be underline clearly the Other Posts 
variable is not representing other comments to posts.

The main goal of this empirical study is to determine the 
impact of using privacy controls have on the users’ posting 
activity. We were able to established a user privacy awareness 
by monitoring usage of the Facebook privacy settings. As it 
was mentioned by means of a dropdown menu it is possible to 
choose who an user want to share a post with: Public, Friends 
of Friends, Friends, and Custom (includes specific groups, 
friend lists or people an user specified to include or exclude). 
Table II contains the results from regression analysis in which 
the dependent variable is Self posts. We tested the dependency 
between user activity (Self posts) and the grow of the social 
network (Friends number) in the context of privacy concern in 
the three models. The first model (column 1 in the table II) was 
established for the 54 non privacy aware users. The second 
model (column 2 in the table II) was created for the 160 users 
which were concern about privacy proving that by using 
privacy settings. The third model (column 3 in the table II) was 
established for the whole group. In contrary to the first model, 
the second one is a significant. The coefficient of Friends 
number is positive and highly statistically significant at .001 
level. This exactly means that increase in the number of friends 
will increase the likelihood of posting status updates where the 
users are using privacy settings. 
 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
The conducted empirical studies are of preliminary 
character, but give an insight into the phenomenon. The 
participants of the study showed a relatively high awareness of 
the use of privacy controls. The research proved that conscious 
use of privacy controls is influenced by the level of users’ 
activity, which in this case stays in positive relationship with 
the number of friends on the website. Contrarily to common 
belief, even group of students, exercise their right to privacy 
whenever it is possible. Based on the obtained results, it may 
be supposed that the impossibility to control privacy settings 
could reduce or even terminate users activity. These 
conclusions find confirmation in the policy of  Facebook, 
which in Fall 2011 introduced pre-defined users and groups. 
As it has been shown, information privacy is a particularly 
important issue that may be subject to conscious management. 
In a broader perspective, the phenomenon has much greater 
implications for all the business use of big data analysis. It may 
be expected that in the near future, customers will demand not 
only to control their personal data gathered by the third party, 
but also to be given access to control mechanisms. Moreover, 
they might also demand the right to delete given information. 
This means that ethical development of business models based 
on a wide repertoire of customers’ behavioural data cannot 
proceed without taking into consideration the active role played 
by customers and their consciousness of such revolutionary 
changes.
