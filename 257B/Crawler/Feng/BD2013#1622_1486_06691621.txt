 Abstract—This information about our GSM calls is stored by
 the TelCo operator in large volumes and with strict privacy con-
 straints making it challenging the analysis of these fingerprints
 for inferring mobility behavior. This paper proposes a strategy
 for mobility behavior identification based on aggregated calling
 profiles of mobile phone users. This compact representation of
 the user call profiles is the input of the mining algorithm for
 automatically classifying various kinds of mobility behavior. A
 further advantage of having defined the call profiles is that
 the analysis phase is based on summarized privacy-preserving
 representation of the original data. We show how these call
 profiles permit to design a two step process - implemented into
 a system - based on a bootstrap phase and a running phase
 for classifying users into behavior categories. We evaluated the
 system in two case studies where individuals are classified into
 residents, commuters and visitors. We conclude the paper with a
 discussion which emphasizes the role of the call profiles for the
 design of a new collaboration model between data provider and
 data analyst.
 I. INTRODUCTION
 The cellular phones based on the GSM protocol are prob-
 ably the most popular devices we carry almost everywhere
 during our life. Since GSM is based on the communication to
 an antenna covering a local area, the active connection - e.g. a
 call - to a certain antenna represents a spatio-temporal position
 information for the user. This information, as collected by the
 telecom provider, thus provides a spatio-temporal fingerprint
 of the users moving in a GSM covered area. For example,
 a user calling only in the weekdays and during the working
 hours in a given area can be considered as a commuter since
 we observe his presence in the monitored area only during
 working temporal slots. The observation above raises three
 considerations: the first one is that GSM data embeds a great
 deal of information about the user habits and behavior; the
 second one is that GSM data, when collected from the provider
 side, comes in large volume thus posing new challenges, not
 only from the collection and storage point of view, but also
 from the analysis and mining side; thirdly, the analysis of this
 large volume of personal data poses several privacy issues.
 This paper is a proposal for facing these three issues with
 an approach for mining large volumes of GSM call data with
 the purpose of identifying the user behavior from his/her
 call habits. An important aspect of our method is that we
 propose a strategy for behavior identification, based on the
 calling profiles of phone users. These call profiles represent
 an aggregate pre-processed data on which to run mining
 algorithm for discovering various kinds of user behavior.
 The advantage of having defined the call profiles is that the
 analysis phase is no more based on the original GSM raw
 (big and privacy sensitive) data, but on an aggregated privacy-
 preserving summary of the original data. We show how these
 call profiles permit to design a two step process based on a
 bootstrap phase and a running phase for classifying users into
 behavior categories based on their call habits.
 More in detail, we present a user behavior inference system
 where an improved inductive learning phase and automatic
 classification replaces the two-phase learning steps adopted
 in [1]. Furthermore, the structure of the analysis process into
 a bootstrap and a running phase leads to another interesting
 result: the call profiles represent a quantifiable model to
 measure the amount of information transferred from the TelCo
 operator to the data analyst. The call profiles therefore can be
 seen as a common interchange model allowing both parties to
 implement a collaboration protocol based on the production
 and analysis of well-defined pieces of information. This brings
 two important advantages for the two parties: the volume of
 data transferred using pre-aggregated data like the call profiles
 is considerably lower, and the privacy is better preserved since
 no original raw data is moved to the data analyst. We present a
 large experimentation conduced in two italian cities from calls
 data provided by an Italian mobile phone operator. In these
 experiments we classified users call habits into three mobility
 behavior categories: Residents, Commuters, and Visitors. This
 may enable several innovative applications like mobility ob-
 servatories where monitoring systems periodically receive call
 profiles from the TelCo operator and then infer the mobility
 behavior of users.
 The paper is organized as follows: after discussing some
 related works in Section II, Section III describes the analysis
 process to discover user behaviors from GSM data. In Section
 IV the method is experimented in two case studies, while
 Section V discusses some important observations about the
 advantages of this method both for a new business model for
 the TelCo operator and for solving the privacy issues. Finally,
 section VI draws the conclusions and future works.
 II. RELATED WORKS
 A previous work of the authors of the present paper is
 [1] where an approach for profiling users based on GMS
 calls is presented. The novel contribution of the present paper
 compared to the previous one is manyfold. First of all, the
 previous paper approach is only experimented in the city of
 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data
 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 550
Pisa, while the present paper adds another city. Secondly, the
 software we have developed here has been improved with an
 automatic classification of call profiles into user categories.
 Thirdly, we envisage a new cooperation protocol between the
 TelCo operator and the data analyst where the data to be
 transferred for analysis are the pre-aggregated call profiles
 instead of the raw GSM data.
 Among the literature on the analysis of GSM data we
 can recall a famous experiment on analysing GSM data for
 studying people movement that have been run in Rome [2]
 and Graz [3]. They use GSM data to realize a real-time urban
 monitoring system. The final objective is to realize a wide
 range of services for the city such as traffic monitoring and
 tourists movement analysis. A different approach comes from
 Schlaich et al. [4] where the authors exploit the GSM handover
 data - the aggregated number of users flowing between cells -
 to perform the reconstruction of vehicles trajectories to study
 the route-choice-behavior of car drivers.
 Another use of GSM data is the identification of interesting
 users places as in [5], where the authors propose a method
 for the identification of meaningful places relative to mobile
 telephone users, such as home and work points. They use
 GSM data (both calls and handovers) collected by the phone
 operator. They distinguish between personal anchor points like
 home, work and other person-related places as the locations
 each user visits regularly, as for example a gym.
 In Pereira et al. [6], the authors exploit cellular phone
 signaling data1, focusing on the prediction of travel demand
 for special events. Since mobility data are dependent on mobile
 phone usage, they proposed to integrate the GSM dataset with
 external data to increase the quantity and the quality of the
 data. Quercia et al. [7] uses GSM data for recommending
 social events to city dwellers. They combine the locations
 estimated by mobile phone data of users in the Greater Boston
 area and the list of social events in the same area. Trajectories
 are extracted from GSM calls and combined with events from
 the web. By crossing the events and the stops, they identify a
 set of potential users participating to events.
 Mobile phone records are analysed also in [8] where the
 authors propose a visual analytics framework to explore spatio-
 temporal data by means of SOM (Self-Organizing Map) anal-
 ysis. They propose a method to cluster the dataset by either of
 the two dimension and evaluate the resulting aggregation on
 the other one. Although they show the potentialities of using
 SOM for analysing mobile phone records, they do not focus
 on identifying user profiles.
 Differently from the above approaches, the aspect we want
 to study in this paper is to characterize the user behavior based
 on the call habits of the tracked users.
 III. THE SYSTEM
 The availability of huge quantity of mobile phone data
 stimulates more and more challenging questions that go
 1These data consist of location estimations which are generated each time
 when a mobile device is connected to the cellular network for calls, messages
 and Internet connections.
 beyond the observation of people movements through the
 territories. What is interesting is to infer some “mobility
 behaviors” starting from the footprints left by the users during
 their mobile phone calls. Knowing where they make a call
 and when, how many times they call from a certain location
 are aspects implicitly stored in the GSM data and can be a
 valid indicator to draw user profiles.
 In this section we introduce an inductive analysis method
 based on Self Organizing Maps [9], to infer user behaviors.
 These behaviors can identify people categories characterizing
 the mobility of the monitored individuals. In this paper we
 focus on three specific examples of these mobility behaviors
 distinguishing people who are resident in the monitored
 area from the commuters and the visitors. According to the
 instructions given by the domain experts, we can formally
 define these categories relative to a selected area A as follows:
 • A person is Resident in an area A when his/her home
 is inside the A. Therefore the presence in A tend to be
 spread to any week day and any hour.
 • A person is a Commuter between an area B and an area
 A if his/her home is in B while the work/school place
 is in A. Therefore the presence of this person is mainly
 inside A during working days/hours.
 • A person is a Visitor in an area A if his/her home and
 work/school places are outside A, and the presence inside
 the area is limited to a certain period of time that can
 allow him/her to perform some activities in A.
 The GSM data used in our analysis method are of two kinds:
 spatio-temporal position of the calls - the Call Data Records
 (CDRs) [10] - and the corresponding spatial coverage of the
 GSM cells.
 The user categories can be obtained from the data by the
 analysis process shown in Figure 1.
 Fig. 1. The analysis process to infer the user categories from GSM data
 To an abstract level, the process foresees two phases: a
 bootstrap (shown at the top of the figure) and a running
 phase (shown at the bottom). The bootstrap phase is aimed at
 finding a temporal profile of the calls for the users, and is based
 on the analysis of the raw GSM data. The running phase starts
 with the temporal calls profiles and performs inferences to
 extract the user categories. The distinction between bootstrap
 551
and running phase is particularly important since we can
 decouple the analysis of GSM raw data - a large dataset of
 limited use due to privacy and storage issues - with the calls
 profiles needed to infer the user categories. In other words,
 the bootstrap phase can be done only once to establish the
 calls profiles needed to infer the user categories. Once the
 format of these aggregated data has been chosen and tested
 in the bootstrap phase, the running phase iterates the process,
 but starting from these temporal calling profiles instead of the
 GSM raw data. The importance of having established the calls
 temporal profiles is that in the running phase the data provider
 limit the data supply to these aggregated profiles, thus avoiding
 the transfer to the analyst of raw data. The running phase can
 therefore be started with new call profiles every time we need
 to refresh the dataset for a continuing monitoring of the area.
 During the bootstrap phase we have a first computation step
 called Spatio-temporal selection and aggregation. Here, the
 CDRs are first analyzed and some statistics are calculated to
 learn about the data and get some aggregate information. These
 statistics are useful for the choice of parameters and thresholds
 in the following steps.
 Each CDR represents an activity of a user with references
 to space (i.e the cells where the call was performed) and time
 (i.e. when the user called). From this information, it is possible
 to reconstruct the call habits of each user. The spatial aspect
 is used when we select the area to be analysed, e.g. where the
 call has been issued. Depending on the application, the area
 selection may help in defining the different user profiles.
 Using only the temporal information, we can derive a
 Temporal Calling Profile (TCP). Formally, given a user u and a
 time granularity (i.e. minute, hour, day, week, etc), a Temporal
 Calling Profile is a sequence T CPu = [a1, a2, . . . , an], where
 ai is the frequency of calls done by u in time unit i. From the
 TCP of a user is is possible to infer his/her typical patterns of
 calls. According to the temporal granularity chosen, it is also
 possible to project a TCP on a time period cycle. For example,
 given a TCP based on day granularity, it is possible to project
 it on a weekly interval. Figure 2, shows an example of the
 extraction of a Weekly TP. The number of calls of each day
 of the month (in the example February 2012) of two users are
 shown in the top part: User 1 (a) and User 2 (b). The Weekly
 TCPs are obtained by projecting their respective TCPs on a
 single week, as shown in parts (c) and (d). The users calls
 over the same day through the 4 weeks are summed up in the
 representative weekly TCPs.
 A TCP does not take into account the space dimension, i.e.
 where the user performed the calls. The spatial information of
 the CDRs is represented by the cell identifier used by the user
 to transmit. When referring to relevant places on the territory
 it is useful grouping different adjacent cells in one group. For
 example, a stadium is a large area that usually is covered
 by several cells: the group of this cells may be referenced
 as stadium. In this work, we aggregate adjacent cells by
 covering the urban area of a city. In general, given a partition
 of the cellular network in group of cells each representing
 an area, for each group A (i.e. for each area covered by
 Fig. 2. Example of temporal profiles computed starting from the GSM calls.
 G), we extract a Space-Constrained Temporal Calling Profile
 (SCTCP). Formally, given an area A as a group of cells, an
 user u and a time granularity, a Space-Constrained Temporal
 Calling Profile is a TCP extracted only from the call activities
 performed by u in the cells in A.
 Both TCP and SCTCP use a single time granularity. Indeed,
 it can useful to distinguish different time intervals within
 the same time unit. For example, given a TCP by day, it
 is interesting for an analyst to split the daily activities by
 time of the day, i.e during the working hours or during the
 night. In this case, we can extend the two profiles above by
 considering a multilevel time granularity. Given a user u, and
 two time granularities T G1 and T G2 (where T G2 is contained
 in T G1), a Multilevel Temporal Calling Profile (MLTCP) is
 a matrix T CP = {Pij}, where the entry Pij represents the
 number of calls performed by u in the time unit i during the
 time interval j. As before, it is possible to define a space
 constrained MLTCP by considering only the activities in a
 specific area A. When T G1 is day and T G2 is hour, a MLTCP
 of a month contains 31 columns and 24 rows: the entry P4,13
 gives the number of calls of the user on 4th of the month
 between 13 and 14.
 For the objective of our analysis, the information of a
 MLTCP can still be aggregated by losing some redundant
 details. In particular, for the objective of this work, we are
 interested only on the presence of a user in a given area during
 a time interval, not on his/her actual volume of calls. Thus,
 we can consider only a predicate to state if user u was present
 in the observation area during a specific time interval. From
 the previous example, the entry P4,13 will yields true if the
 user performed at least one call in that time interval, false
 otherwise.
 We can still aggregate the MLTCP profile, based on days
 and hour of day, by aggregating both temporal granularities
 with conceptual intervals. We call this specific aggregation
 Multi-Dimensional Call Profile (MDCP). A MDCP is a profile
 that captures the user’s presence during the whole period of
 observation, splitted into specific temporal slots. In particular,
 two operations are performed on the two time granularities:
 1) Aggregation of the days in weekday and weekend, and
 2) definition of time intervals within the day, representing the
 interesting time windows during the day. For instance, we have
 used the following intervals:
 • t1 = [00:00:00 - 07:59:59], Early in the morning when
 552
people are usually at home;
 • t2 = [08:00:00 - 18:59:59], Mid day when people are out
 for work/school or other activities;
 • t3 = [19:00:00 - 23:59:59], Late in the evening and night
 when people are typically back home.
 The choice of the daily time intervals is not trivial and it
 strongly depends on the application and on the categories of
 users we want to identify. For instance, to distinguish between
 the two categories of Residents and Commuters, we need
 to concentrate the analysis on a discriminating factor. An
 example is to compare the presence of people in the area of
 observation when they are at home and outside home (work,
 education, leisure) joint with the typical time windows used
 for home and work activities. Therefore, when a user shows
 a temporal profile where (1) during a home time window
 he/she is always outside the monitoring area, and (2) during
 the work time slot and in the weekdays he/she is always inside
 the monitoring area, then we can conclude that this user is
 potentially a commuter. On the contrary, a resident is expected
 to show a call profile where his/her presence is inside the
 monitoring area at both the time slots (home and work) and
 during both weekdays and weekends.
 From this example we can see that we need to analyse
 several dimensions at the same time: the daily temporal slots
 dimension, the day-of-the-week dimension, the spatial dimen-
 sion. Therefore a Multi-Dimensional call profile represents all
 these aspects in one structure, as shown in Figure 3. The figure
 exemplifies the construction process: starting from the calls
 along the days, the presences over the time intervals t1, t2, t3
 are computed, then these presences are aggregated over the
 weekdays and the weekend summing up all of them. The result
 is a sort of compact representation of the global call profile
 for a given user.
 Fig. 3. Example of Multi-Dimensional Call Profile computed from the GSM
 data and representing the user’s presence in the monitored area.
 The Inductive step takes as input the call profiles (which can
 be simply Temporal, or Spatio-constrained Temporal, Multi-
 Level or Multi-Dimensional depending of the kind of user
 behavior we want to define) and, according to their relative
 similarities, group them into homogeneous groups of similar
 call profiles. Here we use an implementation of the Self
 Organizing Map (SOM) [9]. A SOM is a neural network based
 on unsupervised learning that produces a one/two-dimensional
 representation of the input space using a neighborhood func-
 tion to preserve the topological properties of the input space.
 The SOM forms a sort of semantic map where similar samples
 are mapped close together and dissimilar apart are mapped
 far away. This produces a set of nodes, where each node
 represents a group of users with similar profile. We call each
 node the General User Profile.
 The automatic classification of the General User Profiles
 in categories like Residents, Commuters and Visitors is done
 by using a K-Nearest neighbors algorithm where the training
 examples are a set of prototypes, defined by the domain
 experts. In the classification phase, each General User Profile
 is assigned to the label corresponding to the most similar
 prototype. This phase returns a first attempt of automatic
 classification that can be later modified by the expert by using
 the system interface. The quantification step concludes the
 analysis evaluating the percentage of users for each category
 and computing a general statistics. The visualization of the
 results allows the analyst to discover new profiles that were
 not considered in the extraction of the profiles. For example,
 we were able to distinguish in Pisa the nightly visitors from
 the daily visitors.
 This inference process has been implemented in a running
 system written in Java and including a state of the art SOM
 algorithm [9]. The data are stored in a PostgreSQL relational
 database with geo-spatial extension (PostGis).
 IV. CASE STUDY
 The method has been tested with several datasets coming
 from different geographical areas [1], [11]. In this paper we
 focus on the analysis on two Italian cities: Pisa (in the Center
 of Italy) and Cosenza (in the South). The final objective is
 the deployment of a permanent monitoring system for people
 moving in the cities. The two GSM datasets are provided by
 one of the Italian mobile phone operators and consist of one
 month of CDRs of users having an Italian phone contract (no
 roaming users are included in the datasets)2.
 We are interested in understanding the behavior of people
 “using” the city and their locations. Therefore, for the ex-
 periments we selected only the calls performed in the urban
 areas, thus discarding the calls performed outside the selected
 area. Furthermore, we discard the People in Transit, thus
 individuals who only transit through the urban area without
 performing relevant activities. We identify People in Transit as
 the users who make their calls only inside a (short) temporal
 interval of k hours in whole observation period. The value of
 k is estimated based on the minimum time needed to cross
 the urban area without performing any significant activity.
 For both Pisa and Cosenza, k is set to 1 hour according to
 the indication given by the experts in the domain. For both
 experiments we use the same temporal constraints and the

 term cooperation with severe data and privacy constraints. As a consequence
 the data cannot be publicly released and we can only disclose the research
 results.
 553
same settings for the SOM algorithm. In particular: (i) for
 each user we build a temporal profile that captures the weekly
 presence as described in Section III; (ii) for the SOM, we set
 the dimension of the output map to 10x10. These values have
 been empirically identified as the good trade-off to guarantee
 a sufficient number of General Profiles to analyze.
 a) Profiling people in Cosenza: The whole dataset con-
 tains around 25 millions of CDRs collected from October
 14th to November 15th, 2012 in the italian region Calabria.
 The calls are of about 352.600 users. After applying the
 spatial filter, the users calling only in the urban area are
 about 104.600. For each of these users we computed the
 Multidimensional profiles and then we applied the the SOM
 algorithm to groups these profiles into General profiles. The
 quantification step returns the statistics depicted in Figure 4
 (left), that shows the percentages of people for each category.
 b) Profiling people in Pisa: The dataset contains around
 7.8 million of CDRs collected from January 9th to February
 8th 2012 in the Province of Pisa. The calls are relative
 to about 232.200 users. After the spatial filter, the users
 making calls in the urban area of Pisa are about 103.000.
 Similarly to the Cosenza case, we first computed the Multi-
 Dimensional profiles (MDTP), then apply the inductive step
 (SOM algorithm) to obtain the corresponding similarity map.
 It is worth noticing that among the General Profiles some
 interesting new cases can be identified. For example, we can
 identify new general profiles belonging to two new categories:
 Night Visitors and Occasional Visitors. The Night Visitors are
 people calling only during the night and can be interpreted as
 persons who visit Pisa only for the “nightlife”. We know that
 Pisa offers several entertainment and it attracts young people
 for its nightclubs and pubs, while more mature persons may
 be attracted by shows and cultural events. Occasional Visitors
 are, instead, people who visit Pisa only few occasional times
 during the month. The two statistics in Figure 4 are a good
 indicator to describe a sort of “dynamics” of the two cities.
 The categories of people that are present in a city can be in
 fact considered an indicators on how the presences may change
 over time. Indeed, according to the definitions given above, the
 Commuters are not present during the weekends and during
 the nights while People in Transit cross the city but they don’t
 stop for performing some activity.
 Looking at the statistics, we can see that Pisa counts many
 more People in Transit compared to Cosenza. This is because
 the urban area of Pisa is crossed by 2 high traffic roads (an
 important Municipal road and a motorway), a railway with an
 important rail station and an Airport. Particularly the Airport
 generates high flows of people arriving and departing from
 the city and this data has been confirmed by their managers
 since the Airport generates a monthly average of 100.000
 arrivals during the winter. This trend is also confirmed by
 the Pisa Tourist Office observing the fact that many incoming
 visitors actually use the city as a ”hub” to reach Florence or
 other nearby touristic attractions. By studying the density of
 the People in Transit we have another confirmation of this
 behavior. The percentage of Residents and Commuters are
 similar for both the towns, while the percentage of Unknown
 (individuals unclassified due to the few phone calls) is higher
 in Cosenza than in Pisa.
 Fig. 4. Results of the quantification for Cosenza and Pisa.
 These experiments shows some examples of user behavior
 inference using the system we have proposed. These are real
 case studies where we use the inference process to establish
 a kind of monitoring of the city: the call profiles are feeded
 by the mobile operator and the ”running phase” of the system
 computes the user categories and their statistics. When this
 process is iterated periodically (on a weekly or monthly basis)
 it realizes the core component of a more complex infrasture
 like a urban mobility observatory. Naturally, this can be
 enabled only if we can ensure (1) that the data to be transferred
 is reduced to an aggregated summary and (2) the data to
 be transferred for the analysis preserves the privacy of the
 monitored individuals.
 V. BUSINESS MODEL & PRIVACY
 The proposed system provides a quantification of social
 behaviors on a territory that are extremely valuable for local
 governments. At city level, it became crucial to evaluate the
 incidence of distinct groups of user that exploit the resources
 of the city, like water, energy, wastes, etc. A real breakthrough
 of this profiling activity may come from the foundation of a
 continuous observatory capable of sensing these population
 along time, giving the possibility of observing the seasonal
 changes along the year or, more in general, in the long term
 history. One of the main obstacles for the implementation of
 a continuous monitoring is, usually, the availability of GSM
 data. In fact, these data are usually protected by laws on
 individual privacy preservation and it may become difficult
 for the TelCo operator to easily distribute such information.
 Moreover, TelCo operators consider these data as an asset of
 the company and they tend to adopt a conservative approach
 towards their disclosure.
 The analytical phase of our system assumes that the only
 data available are represented as a set of individual temporal
 profile. This assumption is important for two main aspects: 1)
 the temporal profiles represent a quantifiable model to measure
 the amount of information transferred from the TelCo operator
 to the data analyst; 2) the agreement on a common interchange
 model structure allows both parties to implement a protocol
 of collaboration based on the production and analysis of well-
 defined pieces of information.
 When it comes to find an economic agreement with a data
 consumer, it is difficult to give objective criteria for estimating
 554
the cost of the data. To clarify this point, let us consider the
 basic granularity of GSM data, i.e. the CDR format. A single
 CDR log contains the information about a single event on
 the cellular network. Per se, this information may be of little
 utility, and it depends on other activities performed by the
 same user. Thus, the pricing criteria may be influenced by
 this observation and the unit cost of each CDR log depends on
 the behavior of the corresponding user. Our approach tries to
 overcome this problem, by aggregating the behavior of a user
 in a single model. The system we propose serves as connection
 between the data provider and the data analyst, providing
 an objective quantifiable set of models that can be used by
 both parties also for an economic agreement. For example,
 the data analyst may correspond to the TelCo operator a
 monthly fee based on the number of distinct temporal profiles
 received. Note that such agreement may not be possible when
 considering the raw CDR logs.
 On the basis of this common protocol of data exchange,
 the TelCo operator is protected against leakage of important
 corporate information, since the transmitted data is in an
 aggregated form and it provides the minimum set of informa-
 tion needed to enable the sociometer service. Moreover, the
 TelCo is free to rearrange internally the organization of the
 information and it is constrained only on the requirements of
 the models to be produced. In the bootstrap phase, both parties
 have to agree on a set of procedures to produce the aggregates,
 i.e. both define the methods and technologies needed to extract
 the temporal profiles from CDR data. Once this phase is
 concluded, the extraction method may be automated in order
 to produce a set of profiles periodically, for example on a
 monthly basis. One of the most relevant advantages of this
 approach is the possibility of measuring and handle the privacy
 risks involved in the distribution of individual habits. Since
 the Multi-Dimensional temporal profile is a spatio-temporal
 generalization of individual CDR logs, this transformation
 brings in the system a protection against user re-identification.
 We consider, in particular, a linking attack where a malicious
 party knows part of the activities of a user, and his objective is
 to look in the set of the MDT profiles to infer new information
 about other activities of the same user. We set up a series of
 experiments to measure the probability of re-identification on
 the GSM datasets we used for the experiments. We generated
 a series of basic knowledge configurations for the attacker,
 i.e. a combination of observations for a user, ranging from
 few observations to the 99% of the user’s activities. From this
 empirical evaluation we found out that the highest probability
 of re-identification is 0,21% for the 5% of the users in
 the dataset, i.e. each combination of observation we have
 generated selects at least 3,6k candidates among the available
 MDT profiles. This indeed is a valuable protection to ensure
 that the individual information is not at risk.
 VI. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORKS
 This paper proposes a process to analyse the big GSM
 calls data collected by the mobile operators to understand
 the mobility behavior of people. This is done by aggregating
 and summarizing the calls records, then applying data mining
 algorithms to automatically label the different calling profiles
 into user behaviors. The method has been implemented into a
 running system and experimented in two case studies where
 data has been provided by an Italian mobile operators for two
 cities. We also discussed a strategic feature of the method: we
 base our analysis on the aggregation of the raw GSM data
 into calls profiles, thus giving both a new cooperation model
 between TelCo operator and data analyst, and, at the same
 time, providing a good trade off between analysis outcomes
 and privacy preservation.
 Possible improvements include replace the SOM with a
 more sophisticated clustering algorithm and to design a more
 efficient strategy for the automatic classification of the General
 profiles to reduce the percentage of “Unknown”. More in
 general we intend to test the new cooperation protocol with the
 local municipality and the TelCo operator to better understand
 which is the economical impact of this new paradigm in the
 business model of the operator.
