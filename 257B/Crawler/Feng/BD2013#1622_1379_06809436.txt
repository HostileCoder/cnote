 Abstract—ICT is becoming increasingly pervasive to urban
 environments and providing the necessary basis for sustainability
 and resilience of the smart future cities. Often ICT tools for a
 smart city deal with different application domains e.g. land use,
 transport, energy, and rarely provide an integrated information
 perspective to deal with sustainability and socioeconomic growth
 of the city. Smart cities can benefit from such information using
 Big, and often real-time cross-thematic, data collection, pro-
 cessing, integration and sharing through inter-operable services
 deployed in a Cloud environment. However, such information
 utilisation requires appropriate software tools, services and tech-
 nologies to collect, store, analyse and visualise large amounts of
 data from the city environment, citizens and various departments
 and agencies at city scale. This paper presents a theoretical
 perspective on the smart cities focused Big data processing and
 analysis by proposing a Cloud-based analysis service that can
 be further developed to generate information intelligence and
 support decision-making in smart future cities context.
 I. INTRODUCTION
 With the rapid increase in the presence of Internet of
 Things (IoT) and future internet [1][2] technologies in the
 smart cities context [3][4][5], a large amount of data (a.k.a.
 Big data) is generated, which needs to be properly managed
 and analysed for various applications using a structured and
 integrated ICT approach. The structured approach can be based
 on a generic process identifying the necessary steps to be
 followed by using different techniques, tools and services.
 These steps may consist of collection, storage, harmonisation,
 processing, visualisation, analysis and generation of smart city
 application specific information and knowledge for decision
 making using Cloud-based storage and analysis services.
 Today, approximately 75% of the European population
 lives in urban areas and the urbanisation of the European popu-
 lation is expected to increase over 80% by 2020 [6]. A contin-
 uous increase in urban population strains the limited resources
 of a city, affects its resilience to the increasing demands on
 resources and urban governance faces ever increasing chal-
 lenges. Furthermore, sustainable urban development, economic
 growth and management of natural resources such as energy
 and water require better planning and collaborative decision
 making at the local level. In this regard, the innovation in
 ICT can provide integrated information intelligence for better
 urban management and governance, sustainable socioeconomic
 growth and policy development using participatory processes.
 In order to mitigate the above challenges, a shift from classical
 models of top-down governance to new bottom-up approach
 using ICT support is needed to capture multi-dimensional
 expert opinions. Such an ICT driven urban management can
 be considered as a step towards transforming cities into smart
 cities, which are defined as [3]:
 . . . a city which invests in ICT enhanced governance
 and participatory processes to define appropriate
 public service and transportation investments, that
 can ensure sustainable socio-economic development,
 enhanced quality-of-life and intelligent management
 of natural resources.
 .
 ICT brings a significant change in smart cities’ governance,
 particularly in terms of improved communication and infor-
 mation services, as well as offering the potential to provide
 citizens with the necessary information to better manage
 and utilise their surroundings and city resources. Similarly,
 these innovative tools provide the urban planners with the
 necessary intelligence for decision making needed to actively
 manage the urban environment. However, the realisation of the
 requisite knowledge and tools depends on the availability of
 the underlying data and facilities to process such data. Ap-
 propriate mechanisms are needed to manage data acquisition
 using different methods such as remote sensing, RFIDs, sensor
 networks, smart phones, city databases, satellite imagery, open
 data from governments initiatives [7]. Furthermore, processing
 and integration of cross-disciplinary data is needed to get
 knowledge and intelligence for the sustainability, resilience
 and governance of a city. This would also provide the nec-
 essary context-aware information services for general public
 such as public transport services, air quality of surrounding
 environment, etc. In addition, citizens can also participate in
 information collection such as pertaining to traffic gridlock de-
 tection (i.e. via crowd sourcing), building or household energy
 usage and environmental sensing related to bio-diversity and
 green infrastructures. Such public participation empowers the
 general public and raises awareness about their environment
 and health, which can result in behavioural changes for green
 and sustainable healthy city-wide initiatives.
 Smart cities [4] use a variety of ICT solutions to deal with
 real life urban challenges. Some of these challenges include
 environmental sustainability, socioeconomic innovation, partic-
 ipatory governance, better public services, planning and collab-
 orative decision-making. In addition to creating a sustainable
 futuristic smart infrastructure, overcoming these challenges can
 empower the citizens in terms of having a personal stake in the
 well-being and betterment of their civic life. Consequently, city
 administrations can provide better urban governance and man-
 agement by applying these ICT solutions. Such ICT enabled

solutions thus enable efficient transport planning, better water
 management, improved waste management, new constructions
 and structural methods for health of buildings and effective
 environment and risk management policies for the citizens.
 Moreover, other important aspects of the urban life such as
 public security, air quality and pollution, public health, urban
 sprawl and bio-diversity loss and energy efficiency can also
 benefit from these ICT solutions.
 ICT as prime enabler for smart cities transforms application
 specific data into a useful information and knowledge. From
 the ICT perspective, the possibility of realisation of smart cities
 is being enabled by smarter hardware (smart phones, sensor
 nets, smart household appliances, etc.), which can organise in
 an ‘Internet of Things’ (IoT) and thus become a major source
 of user and environment specific data. With the passage of
 time, the volume of data generated from these IoTs is bound
 to increase exponentially and classified as Big data [8]. In
 addition, cities already possess land use, transport, census and
 environmental monitoring data which is collected from various
 local, often not interconnected, sources and used by application
 specific systems but is rarely used as collective source of
 information (i.e. system of systems [9]) for urban governance
 and planning decisions. Many local governments are making
 such data available for public use as ‘open data’ [7]. Man-
 aging such large amount of data and analysing for various
 applications e.g. future city models, visualisation, simulations,
 provision of quality public services and information to citizens
 and decision making becomes challenging without applying
 appropriate tools and techniques.

 city applications in Cloud environment
 In the above context, recent emergence of Cloud computing
 promises solutions to such challenges by facilitating Big data
 storage and delivering the capacity to process, visualise and
 analyse city data. Such an infrastructure level solution can also
 facilitate the decision makers in meeting the QoS requirements
 by providing an integrated information processing infrastruc-
 ture for variety of smart cities applications to support decision
 making and urban governance.
 Figure 1 depicts our view of the main thematic pillars of
 smart cities: smart people, smart economy, smart environment,
 smart governance and smart mobility which contribute towards
 the sustainability of resources and resilience against increasing
 urban demands. The main motive towards developing such a
 view is to consider a holistic approach for smart cities by
 providing data acquisition, integration, processing and analysis
 mechanisms to synthesize the needed information that can help
 in enhancing resilience and sustainability of a city. Managing
 data for these thematic domains in a Cloud environment pro-
 vides the opportunity to integrate data acquired from various
 sources and process it in acceptable time-frames. However, it
 is not straightforward to adopt Cloud computing to deal with
 smart city applications due to a number of challenges and
 requirements [10]. Our aim here is to discuss a theoretical
 perspective on how these challenges can be addressed in
 part by using ICT tools and software services to intelligently
 analyse and manage the complex Big data of smart cities, and
 by incorporating a suitable Cloud architecture such as the one
 proposed by [4], [11], [12].
 The remainder of this paper is structured as: Section II
 provides a simple use case of smart cities identifying needs of
 information processing and knowledge generation. A service
 architecture and design for analytical processing of Big data
 for smart cities in Cloud environment is presented in Section
 III. In Section IV, we conclude our discussion and present
 future research directions.
 II. AN EXAMPLE USE CASE: SMART TOWN CENTRE
 Consider the use case of a city that decides to transform
 its urban environment by interrelating peoples, processes,
 places and technologies. There can be number of different
 scenarios in this context e.g. related to urban management,
 water management, waste management, public administration,
 urban planning, policy development, citizens engagement, en-
 vironmental sustainability, business development and economy,
 energy efficiency, transport management, public security and
 health. Naphade et al. [9] highlight the need of innovation
 in planning, management and operation to transform a smart
 city. They argued for a ‘system of systems’ based approach
 using a unified information model that makes it possible to
 acquire a complete picture of urban complexity and processes.
 They also present several smart cities application examples
 and opportunities of using innovative ICT solutions and as-
 sociated development challenges. Similarly, Libelium [13]
 lists 50 sensors-based applications for a smarter world which
 contribute towards development of a smart future city. We will
 build upon such use cases and briefly present one hypothetical
 smart future city use case.
 In most urban settings, the town centre can be considered as
 the core of major socio-economic activities including tourism,
 social, business, shopping, work, travelling hubs (bus or train
 stations), education (colleges/universities) and often has resi-
 dential places as well. Typically, a number of people commute
 to the town centre at different times on weekdays (mostly for
 work) and over weekends (shopping, work, leisure etc.) and
 act as a stimulus to the socioeconomic development. These
 activities also create an environmental footprint that requires
 enhanced information intelligence to manage and mitigate any
 negative effects on these town centres. For such an urban
 382
setting to be transformed into a smart town centre, there is
 a core requirement of pervasive, interconnected communica-
 tion infrastructure and access to contextual information of its
 citizens and physical spaces by data sensing, processing and
 generating useful information for different stakeholders for
 consumption and decision making.
 Amongst many other technologies, environmental sensors
 and smart phones are major source of Big data points in a
 city environment as these technologies assist in determining
 presence and location of the objects and, in case of smart
 phones, provide a means of information dissemination and
 consumption as well. In order to utilise sensor based in-
 formation in a more effective way, additional digital data
 including that of city maps, road networks, pedestrian/cycling
 tracks, cadastre, buildings, populations census, utility services,
 digital elevation model, etc. are often needed from various
 city databases to process and utilise the needed information.
 For instance, a common scenario can be locating empty
 parking spaces during peak hours using smart phones. For
 example, Libelium smart parking sensors for parking man-
 agement system (http://www.libelium.com/smart parking/) can
 provide real time information to motorists in town centres,
 thus saving fuel costs and reduced CO2 emissions. Another
 scenario can be based on a smart phone application with an
 interactive and navigable map of the town centre that allows
 end users (e.g. citizens or tourists) to find the nearest attraction,
 bank or pharmacy etc. Such a smart phone application can
 also support a feedback mechanism allowing end users to
 leave comments/annotations (e.g. complaint, fault reporting,
 experience details, appreciation, etc.) by clicking on a specific
 point of a map (or auto-detected current location using GPS),
 which can be dealt by city government staff. A new scenario
 relies on the information about number of vehicles available on
 specific roads of town centre which can be detected by specific
 counting sensors and/or vehicle fitted with GPS devices. This
 information helps in route optimisation by providing a traffic
 congestion map in real-time to the citizens who are planning to
 visit/leave town centre and assist their decision making towards
 their mode of transport (private, public) and route planning. In
 an alternative scenario, a similar kind of information can be
 collected by processing mobile phone activity data available to
 mobile service providers to determine sojourn population dis-
 tribution and mobility patterns [14], which can help transport
 agencies to tune the frequency of public transport dynamically
 on specific routes of the town centre. City councils can also
 use this information for public consultation by visualising
 overall socio-economic and environmental impact using web
 and/or smart phone platforms and engage the public on the
 development of new policies e.g. regarding restricted traffic
 zones, congestion charges, etc. and collaborative decision
 making.
 All the above scenarios indicate that there are numer-
 ous possibilities for the development of smart solutions for
 the smart town centre use case. The Cloud-based Big data
 collection, processing and visualisation play a major role in
 dealing with the scalability issues of data, processing power
 and increasing number of users i.e. new scenarios, novel use
 cases, size and population of the city, etc., which can ultimately
 contribute towards better management, decision making and
 governance. In the following section, we propose an architec-
 ture for Cloud-based Big data analytics focused towards the
 smart city use cases.
 III. DEVELOPING AN ANALYTICAL PROCESSING SERVICE
 This section discusses two elements pertinent to the devel-
 opment of a generic Cloud service for smart city related Big
 data analysis: i) design of the Cloud service, and ii) reusability
 of existing tools and techniques. Such a Cloud-based analysis
 service can be exploited as Analytics as a Service model.
 A. Architectural Design of the Cloud Based Big Data Analysis
 Our guiding design principle for the Cloud-based analysis
 service is to reuse existing, well-tested tools and techniques.
 Therefore, we use some architectural concepts from our pre-
 vious work on Cloud architecture for information intelligence
 in urban systems [11], [4],

 Fig. 2. Proposed Architectural Design
 The system architecture, as shown in Figure 2, is divided
 into three tiers to enable the development of a unified knowl-
 edge base. Each layer represents the potential functionality
 that we need to meet our objectives. The first requirement
 in the bottom-up approach of our design is data collection,
 however it is likely that collected data will be in a number of
 different formats due to heterogeneous data sources. Data from
 heterogeneous sources can be exposed through unified service
 interfaces if its meta-data is known and processed. The lowest
 layer in our architecture deals with this requirement.
 The lowest layer in the architecture consists of distributed
 and heterogeneous repositories that are subscribed to the
 system. There are two ways data can be retrieved from these
 repositories. First, if APIs and services have been implemented
 by these data providers, then data access and retrieval process
 becomes simple because either an API or a web service can be
 invoked to retrieve the meta-data and populate the meta-data
 repository e.g. Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) compliant
 web services. Alternatively, if an API or web service has
 not been provided by a data provider, suitable extractors can
 be implemented to extract meta-data from these distributed
 repositories to access the databases when this is needed. Apart
 from these data repositories, a major source of data will be
 ‘connected things’ (or sensor networks) that will sense city
 environment in real-time and provide large data volumes,
 which would also need to be analysed, filtered and processed
 into meaningful information. In this respect, Nathalie et al.
 383
[12] introduce the concept of ‘Cloud of things’ by combining
 sensor networks in a Cloud environment. They abstract the
 heterogeneity of variety of sensors using semantics and OGC
 standards such as Sensor Web Enablement (SWE), Sensor
 Observation Service (SOS), SensorML etc. and provide useful
 insights to integrate sensor data in a smart city context.
 Once the meta-data of heterogeneous data sources has
 been populated into meta-data stores, mappings are established
 between the resources, links are generated and the data is
 made semantically relevant and browse-able. The data is then
 mapped using standardised resource description semantics, e.g.
 via an RDF store which has all the necessary links established
 between artefacts and resources. In case of linked services,
 higher level services and mashups can be composed to browse
 and make use of this data for interesting scenarios. The smart
 links layer finds new scenarios and supports workflows to
 develop relations that were not possible in the isolated data
 repositories. In the case of linked data, databases can be
 browsed to serve queries and find events of interest that were
 not possible without the availability of linked data.
 An intelligent engine (top layer) will process the data
 returned from Open APIs available in the linked data and ser-
 vices layers. The engine unifies the data that is available in the
 linked data and services stores and helps users in submitting
 queries, algorithms and workflows to find information from
 the repositories. The analysis engine will process the data that
 is retrieved through the respective Open API implementations
 once these are invoked by the Explorer. Users, or third-party
 services, will be able to apply stochastic rules and criteria to
 generate non-obvious relations and associations based on the
 content of the linked databases.
 The third layer in the architecture is an interactive Explorer.
 The Explorer will provide a scalable and semantics-aware
 browsing platform to the meta-data and distributed databases.
 This provides the interactivity and interfaces that users need
 to browse the information based on their topics of interest,
 submit queries and get access to unified resources. User can
 refine their queries after interpreting the results so that query
 and analysis algorithm evolution and execution become an
 interactive process. The Explorer will also interact with the
 intelligent engine to support users in their stochastic analysis
 and data mining operations to derive and produce new links
 and relations.
 The system architecture is also based on the following
 design principles:
 • System scalability: The information linking, browsing,
 and analytics processes will be scalable. The aim is to
 use technologies such as Hadoop MapReduce to scale
 the analytics engine. Machine learning algorithms will
 be transformed as MapReduce scripts to parallelize
 the analysis and search processes. Similarly, stochastic
 aspects will be converted into MapReduce scripts to
 scale and optimize the processing activity. The system
 will be capable of both batch and stream mode of data
 processing to cater for real-time data streams being
 made available by environment sensor networks and
 other data services [15]
 • Low latency: The architecture will support the low
 latency and better quality of service goals to give users
 a great browsing and analysis experience. To enable
 this, in-memory storage and analytics approaches will
 be exploited. A high level in-memory storage and
 Cloud-based processing cluster will be created that
 will exploit the low latency resources in clustered
 memories to cut down latencies, provide quick results
 and increase user experience on a distributed system
 of heterogeneous repositories. From system hardware
 point of view, GPU based scheduling, resource allo-
 cation and optimisation approaches will be used to
 optimise the data interrogation, stochastic processing
 and browsing operations. Overall aim here is not to
 rely on a particular hardware and to make the system
 hardware independent.
 • Open system principle: The architecture will exploit
 open APIs and standards-based technologies. First
 of all, this will avoid lock-ins. The use of open
 standards will make the system open so that new tools
 and technologies which have better functionality and
 performance can be integrated on demand provided
 they are standards compliant. Secondly, the system can
 be extended to link and integrate new databases. The
 use of open standards will encourage data providers
 and user communities to join the system resulting in
 an ecosystem of repositories and planners, leading to
 unprecedented discoveries and interesting scenarios.
 • Data acquisition and management: The system will
 implement two data acquisition mechanisms depend-
 ing on whether both an open data schema and its
 associated API are available from the data provider
 or not. If both data schema and API are accessible,
 deterministic queries can be made to the provider
 for data acquisition purposes. In addition to this, a
 stochastic engine will also play an important role in
 extracting data from sources by helping the users to
 find data sets that may add value to the analysis
 process. This may lead planners (or end users) to
 come up with ad-hoc or stochastic queries that are
 sent to the data sources for a batch like data querying
 process to assist planners in their quest for knowledge
 production.
 • Processing, Analysis and Use: The system will pro-
 cess raw data to establish both casual associations
 and semantic links amongst multiple data sources.
 Analyses will be performed both in batch mode and
 based on interactive input. The latter will be accessed
 through the Explorer which will be implemented as
 an open, publicly-available web tool. The batch mode
 will be realised by implementing stochastic operations
 on a Hadoop-based analytic platform. A number of
 data mining and machine learning algorithms will be
 experimented to produce the stochastic functionality
 in order to find events of interests to planners.
 B. Existing Tools and techniques
 There exists several tools and approaches for large scale
 data management [16], [17], [18], [19] and analytics [20], [21]
 in Cloud environment [22], [23], [24], [25], [26] and number of
 issues in this domain have been identified [27], [28]. Below we
 384
represent some well-known tools and techniques which provide
 necessary foundation for the above architecture.
 • System and Database Management
 ? OpenStack (http://www.openstack.org) will be
 used to create a scalable and standards com-
 pliant cloud infrastructure. This will lead to
 a standard and scalable open source Cloud
 operating system enabling the system to create
 and offer Cloud computing services running on
 standard hardware.
 ? Apache Cassandra (NoSQL Database) will
 be used as a datastore to elastically organise
 linked meta-data in the system. Linear scal-
 ability and proven fault-tolerance on Cloud
 infrastructure makes Cassandra a viable plat-
 form for organising critical data. Cassandra’s
 data model offers column oriented schema
 and powerful built-in caching that will help
 planners (end users) in getting the quality of
 service in exploiting the data in the system.
 • Web Resources Extraction
 ? Apache Solr (http://lucene.apache.org/solr)
 will be used for searching the databases.
 Solr is a standalone enterprise search server
 with a REST-like API. The operations such
 as full-text search, faceted search, near real-
 time indexing, dynamic clustering, database
 integration, rich document handling, and
 geo-spatial search can be supported through
 Apache Solr.
 ? Configurable browsers Lynx (http://lynx.isc.
 org) or w3m (w3m.sourceforge.net) can be
 used to support the stochastic search engine
 of the system
 ? REST base web service interfaces will be
 provided to access the meta-data, applications
 (interactive and batch) as well as the source
 repositories.
 • Data Analysis Tools
 ? RapidMiner: Open source data mining toolkit
 supporting both analytics and visualisation and
 R, which is a functional language adopted
 by the statistics research community, will be
 exploited for analysis. To scale the analyses
 process, Hadoop MapReduce (http://hadoop.
 apache.org) will be integrated with R and
 RapidMiner to interrogate and mine the data
 at scale.
 • Data and Meta-data Formats: Existing metadata for-
 mats (such as the European Data Model, Talis Aspire,
 the Open Library and DBLP as Linked Data) will
 be used to describe and store meta-data extracted
 from different sources. Similar to Ontologies, common
 meta-data format will be defined using eXtensible
 Markup Language (XML) conforming to the Re-
 source Description Framework (RDF) specification.
 The extensible nature of mark-up language allows new
 vocabularies to be added as newly discovered asso-
 ciations emerge. SPARQL, an RDF query language,
 will be used to retrieve and manipulate data stored in
 Resource Description Framework format.
 • Processing Objects: REST, XML and JSON will
 form the foundation of the access and interac-
 tion APIs. API’s will return data in the follow-
 ing formats: i) Extensible Markup Language (XML),
 and ii) JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). XML
 and JSON representations of Open API’s will
 be exploited to make available the data, meta-
 data as well the tools for interrogating and vi-
 sualising the data. Open API’s initiatives such as
 mingle (https://mingle.io), Bloomberg’s open mar-
 ket data initiative (http://www.openbloomberg.com/
 2013/02/06/open-api-blpapi-v3-6-x-released), and the
 Guardian Open Platform (http://www.theguardian.
 com/open-platform) will be evaluated for reuse.
 IV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
 Smart cities provide an opportunity to connect people
 and places using innovative technologies that helps in better
 city planning and management. At the core of smart cities
 is the collection, management, analysis and visualisation of
 huge amount of data that is generated every minute in an
 urban environment due to socioeconomic or other activities.
 Smart cities data can be collected directly from variety of
 sensors, smart phones, citizens and integrated (or linked) with
 city data repositories to perform analytical reasoning and
 generate required information for decision-making for better
 urban governance. However, this requires carefully prepared
 uniform and integrated information model of cross thematic
 data in a Cloud environment that will provide the benefit of
 developing variety of information services for different city
 applications. Cloud computing provides a great opportunity
 to manage, analyse and process the Big data generated by
 cities but needs new tools and services to process and analyse
 city data effectively. Our future research work is to develop
 a prototype in order to identify technical implications and
 limitations and suggest viable solutions.
