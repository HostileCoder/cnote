In this work, we analyze a historical archive of single event upsets 
(SEUs) maintained by Inmarsat, one of the world’s leading 
providers of global mobile satellite communications services. 
Inmarsat has operated its geostationary communication satellites 
and collected extensive satellite anomaly and telemetry data since 
1990. Over the course of the past twenty years, the satellites have 
experienced more than 226 single event upsets (SEUs), a catch-all 
term for anomalies that occur in a satellite’s electronics such as 
bit-flips, trips in power supplies, and memory changes in attitude 
control systems. While SEUs are seemingly random and difficult 
to predict, we correlate their occurrences to space weather 
phenomena, and specifically show correlations between SEUs and 
solar proton events (SPEs). SPEs are highly energetic protons 
that originate from solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs). It is 
thought that when these particles impact geostationary (GEO) 
satellites they can cause SEUs as well as solar array degradation. 
We calculate the associated statistical correlations that each SEU 
occurs within one day, one week, two weeks, and one month of 10 
MeV SPEs between 10 – 10,000 particle flux units (pfu). 
However, we find that SPEs are most prevalent at solar 
maximum and that the SEUs on Inmarsat’s satellites occur out of 
phase with the solar maximum. Ultimately, this suggests that 
SPEs are not the primary cause of the Inmarsat SEUs.  A better 
understanding of the causal relationship between SPEs and SEUs 
will help the satellite communications industry develop 
component and operational space weather mitigation techniques 
as well as help the space weather community to refine radiation 
models.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The UK satellite telecommunications company, Inmarsat, 
currently operates ten satellites that provide global coverage for 
its mobile services. These satellites consist of three different 
generations. Inmarsat maintains an archive containing more 
than twenty years’ worth of telemetry and satellite anomaly 
data from these three satellite generations.  
 
The contents of Inmarsat’s telemetry database include 
component health data such as total bus power and solar array 
current. The database also contains records of various 
anomalies including solid-state power amplifier (SSPA) 
failures, telemetry corruption, and single event upsets (SEUs). 
In this work, SEUs are categorized as seemingly random 
anomalies that occur in a satellite’s electronics; for example: 
bit-flips, trips in power supplies, and memory changes in 
attitude control systems (ACS). For the two generations 
spanning from 1996 to 2012, there were 226 SEUs combined. 
The satellite fleets are referred to in this paper as A and B. Of 
these, fleet A experienced 28 SEUs, an average of 5.6 SEUs 
per satellite, and fleet B experienced 198, an average of 66 
SEUs per satellite. SEUs are particularly interesting types of 
anomalies because they are hard to predict and, as our results 
show, dependent on hardware. As hardware technological 
capabilities grow and component form factors shrink, satellites 
are becoming increasingly more susceptible to radiation effects 
such as charging, radiation damage, and SEUs [1].   
 
SEUs occur when highly energetic particles penetrate the 
surface and deposit charge into the electronics of a satellite [2]. 
Protons with energies greater than 10 MeV are capable of 
penetrating the surface of a satellite, and can produce damage 
equivalent to years of normal on-orbit operation [1].  In severe 
cases, SEUs can cause satellites to lose control and tumble, 
potentially leading to satellite failure.  
 
High-energy solar protons originate from coronal mass 
ejections (CMEs). The Sun emits CMEs at speeds of 1000 
  
 
km/s. These particles take only 1.5 to 2 days to reach Earth [1] 
[3], and when the particles reach satellites at geostationary orbit 
they can cause SEUs and significantly contribute to solar array 
degradation [4]. 
 
High-energy protons can penetrate the Earth's magnetic field at 
the poles, crash into neutral atmospheric particles, and produce 
ion and electron pairs that temporarily increase the plasma 
density in the lowest regions of the ionosphere. This causes 
absorption of short-wave radio signals and widespread blackout 
of communications, sometimes called a polar cap absorption 
event. In addition, hazardous levels of high-energy particle 
radiation build up in the magnetosphere; this radiation can 
damage spacecraft microelectronics and pose a serious threat to 
the safety of astronauts. Energetic proton events can cause 
increased noise in photonics, total radiation dose problems, 
power panel damage, and single event upsets. 
 
Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) consist mostly of protons (84% 
hydrogen) along with alpha particles (15% Helium) and less 
than 1% of heavier nuclei [5] [1]. GCRs have energies up to 
1014 MeV and occur out of phase with the eleven year solar 
cycle; the radiation from GCRs peaks at solar minimum and 
reaches a minimum at solar maximum [5] [6]. At solar 
minimum, the solar wind speeds are low, which allow GCRs to 
reach the magnetosphere. This does not usually occur at solar 
maximum because the solar winds inhibit the GCRs from 
entering a trajectory towards the magnetosphere and the 
geostationary satellites. We do not assess GCR data in this 
study, but plan to address GCRs in future work, as strong 
GCRs can also cause significant SEUs [7]. 
 
The two main sources of particles that cause SEUs are solar 
energetic protons (SEP) and galactic cosmic rays (GCRs); the 
particles trapped within the magnetosphere do not possess 
sufficient energy to cause SEUs for GEO communication 
satellites [5]. While it is clear that both high-energy solar 
protons and GCRs are capable of causing SEUs, our analysis of 
Inmarsat’s SEU data shows that sensitivity to SEUs is also a 
function of different types of hardware. Although the satellite 
fleets under consideration here have consistent designs within a 
fleet, it is important to also recognize that multiple copies of a 
single hardware device produced from a single manufacturer 
have been found to vary by as much as 15% [8]. 
 
To date, Inmarsat has not had any extended service 
interruptions, permanent equipment failures or suffered any 
reduction in satellite lifetime directly attributable to SEUs. 
While SEUs are challenging to predict, the Inmarsat satellites 
make use of automatic on-board error detection and correction 
functions, coupled with the use of automated ground system 
monitoring. 
 
In Section 2 we analyze solar proton events and their 
occurrence rates throughout the 11-year solar cycle. In Section 
3 we assess the SEUs on satellite fleet A and satellite fleet B, 
and statistically correlate them to the solar proton events 
discussed in Section 2. We summarize our results and discuss 
our conclusions in Section 4. 
II. SOLAR PROTON EVENTS 
Large solar proton events (SPEs), while fairly uncommon, can 
cause severe radiation damage to spacecraft, because they 
excite protons and heavy ions to high energy levels capable of 
penetrating surrounding structures and shielding of satellite 
electronics. The energy levels required for this form of 
penetration are approximately 50–100 MeV/nucleon [8], 
however particles at 10 MeV can also contribute to surface 
charging and SEUs [1].   
 
For this study, the solar proton event data comes from the 
NOAA Space Weather Prediction Center 
(http://www.swpc.noaa.gov/ftpdir/indices/SPE.txt). For each 
event, the proton fluxes are integrated five-minute averages 
recorded from Geostationary Operational Environmental 
Satellites (GOES), which have monitored and reliably collected 
space environment data since 1976. The start of a proton event 
is defined when three consecutive proton fluxes are recorded at 
a rate greater than or equal to ten particle flux units (pfu), 
where one pfu is a rate of one particle per square centimeter of 
detector area per steradian of solid angle scanned per second of 
time. The end of a proton event is the last instance the rate is 
above ten pfu. This definition accounts for multiple proton 
flares or interplanetary shock increases within one proton 
event.  
 
In this section, we compare the occurrence of solar proton 
events to the solar cycle. Figure 1 shows the smoothed sunspot 
number and the 10 MeV solar proton events from 10-10,000 
pfu between 1996 and 2012. The sunspot number is a metric 
used to assess the overall strength and fluctuation of solar 
activity, such as solar flares and CMEs. The increase and 
decrease in sunspot number defines the solar maximum and 
solar minimum. While at solar maximum there is an increased 
chance of solar flares and coronal mass ejections, yet even at 
solar minimum the Sun can produce damaging storms [9]. The 
solar magnetic activity cycle has a period of approximately 
eleven years.  
 
 
Figure 1: The distribution of 10 MeV SPEs from 10 – 
10,000 pfu throughout the solar cycle. 
  
 
 
Solar proton events that involve 10 MeV particles with arrival 
rates greater than 10 pfu are considered dangerous for SEU 
events [10]. A list of 10 MeV solar proton events for between 
10 and 10,000 pfu were recorded and can be found in 
Appendices A—D. The strongest and most frequent SPEs 
occur when the sunspot number is at a maximum; which is 
known as solar maximum, and occurs between 1998 and 2002.  
 
In 2001 there were 22 SPEs and in 2002 there were 19 SPEs; 
these two years had the highest number of SPEs between 1996 
and 2012. In 2001 and 2002, five of the six most severe SPEs, 
measuring 12,900 to 31,700 pfu, occurred during solar 
maximum. Significantly fewer SPEs occurred at solar 
minimum: from 2007 to 2009 there were zero SPEs.  
 
For a seasonal perspective, the distribution of SPEs per month 
is shown in Figure 2. The highest number of SPEs occurred in 
November with sixteen SPEs. Interestingly for SEUs (instead 
of SPEs), the season around northern hemisphere winter 
solstice is the period of time with the fewest SEUs [4]. The 
months with the second highest number of SPEs were April 
and July, which both had twelve SPEs. For the northern 
hemisphere, April is just after vernal equinox, and July is just 
after summer solstice.

GOES, between 1996 and 2012. Dates of SPE events are in 
Appendix A – Appendix D 
 
Figure 3 shows the distribution of SPEs during the Bartels 
cycle.  The Bartels cycle, similar to the Carrington cycle, is the 
27-day cycle of the Sun’s rotation [11]. There is no obvious 
trend for this distribution. The day with the highest number of 
SPEs occurred on the third and 26th day of the Bartels cycle, 
and the day with the fewest number of SPEs occurs on the 22nd 
day of the cycle.

III. SINGLE EVENT UPSETS 
The causal relationship between high-energy protons and single 
event upsets has been studied since 1979, when two separate 
papers, Guenzer et al. and McNulty et al., presented evidence 
that high-energy protons were capable of causing SEUs [2]. A 
follow-up study analyzed the correlation between SEUs and the 
space environment that occurred on the NASA’s Tracking and 
Delay Relay Satellite System (TDRS-1) from 1984 to 1990 [5].  
Similar to Inmarsat, TDRS-1 was designed to provide 
communications and high-data rate transmission services. 
Wilkinson [5] finds that protons with energies greater than 10 
MeV—40 MeV tend to induce SEUs, and that SEUs are most 
likely to occur when protons with energies >50 MeV exceed a 
rate of 10 pfu [13]. However, Tylka et al. [8] states that in order 
to do a thorough correlation analysis of SEUs, both solar 
protons and heavy ions must be investigated.  
 
The composition of the solar wind is a mixture of materials 
found in the solar plasma, ionized hydrogen (electrons and 
protons) with an 8% component of helium (alpha particles) and 
trace amounts of heavy ions and atomic nuclei: C, N, O, Ne, 
Mg, Si, S, and Fe that were ripped apart by heating of the Sun's 
outer atmosphere, the corona [12]. This study attempts to 
correlate only solar protons to SEUs; analysis of alpha particles 
and heavy ions are planned in future work.  
 
Figure 4 shows the distribution of SEUs per month. The 
highest number of SEUs occurs in April, followed by May. As 
shown in Figure 2, April was the month with the second 
highest number of SPEs, after November, which had the 
highest number of SPEs. For SEUs, November had the fourth 
lowest number of SEUs, followed by December, June, and 
February, which had the fewest number of SEUs.  
  
 
 
Figure 4: The number of SEUs per month measured from 
GOES, dates attached in Appendix A – Appendix D. 
 
Choi et al. (2012) found that the majority of satellite anomalies 
occurred in spring (March-May) and fall (September – 
October). While we cannot state that all types of anomalies 
follow this trend, the occurrence of the majority of SEUs on 
Inmarsat’s satellite fleets are consistent with the results in Choi 
et al., and occur in the spring and fall [13]. 
 
Figure 5 shows the distribution of SEUs during the Bartels 27-
 day solar cycle. Similar to Figure 3, there does not seem to be 
any clear and consistent trends for SEUs during the Bartels 
solar cycle. The day with the highest number of SEUs occurs 
on the 21st day of the cycle, and the day with the fewest number 
of SEUs occurs on the 20th day of the cycle.  
 
 
Figure 5: The number of SEUs per day of Bartels cycle 
measured from GOES, dates attached in Appendix A – 
Appendix D 
 
SEUs can occur at any time during the solar cycle, but tend to 
occur nearer to solar minimum, as shown in Figure 6, which is 
consistent with previous investigations [14] [15].  
 
As discussed in Section II, Figure 1 shows that more solar 
proton events occur at solar maximum than at solar minimum. 
Figure 6 shows the SEUs that occurred on Fleet A between 
1996 and 2012; the different colors represent the five different 
satellites in fleet A. The SEUs tend to occur most often at solar 
minimum. Specifically, the largest number of SEUs per year 
occurred in 1997, 2005 and 2009. However, between 1998 and 
2000, the years leading up to solar maximum, there were also 
high levels of SEUs, and there were no SEUs in both 2001 near 
solar maximum as well as in 2008, near solar minimum.  
 
 
Figure 6: The solar cycle and the annual number of SEUs 
per satellite for satellite fleet A. The different colors 
represent the five different satellites in fleet A. 
 
One possible explanation why there are zero SEUs at the 2008 
solar minimum is the fact that there are only a few SEU events 
for satellite fleet A. Satellite fleet A only experienced 28 total 
SEUs, in comparison with fleet B, which experienced 198 
SEUs. Figure 7 is a scatter plot of the twenty-eight SEUs that 
occurred on fleet A. The SEUs are shown as a black asterisk 
for 10 MeV solar proton events ranging from 10–10,000 pfu. 
There were zero SPEs between 2006 and 2010, which is 
approximately solar minimum.   
 
As shown in Figure 1, a high concentration of SPEs occurs 
during solar maximum, or between 1998 and 2002. During this 
time, ten of the twenty-eight SEUs on fleet A occur. The other 
eighteen SEUs occur during the solar minimum of Cycle 23 
and Cycle 24.  
 
Table 1 shows the SEUs on Satellite fleet A that occur one day, 
one week, two weeks, and one month before 10 MeV solar 
proton events with rates between 10-10,000 pfu.

Fleet A encountered 28 SEUs, and eleven of these occurred up 
to one month before an SPE. Of these eleven, four SEUs 
occurred two weeks before an SPE and three occurred one 
week before an SPE. No events occurred one day before an 
SPE. Should a single SEU occur within one month of both a 
10 MeV SPE and within one month of a later 100 MeV SPE it 
is counted twice, once for each of the different energy levels.  
 
Table 2 shows the number of SEUs on fleet A that occur after 
an SPE for the same periods of time in Table 1.

Of the 28 SEUs encountered by fleet A, nine SEUs occurred 
one month after a solar proton event. Out of these nine SEUs, 
five occurred two weeks and five occurred one week after an 
SPE, and one SEU occurred one day after an SPE. 
  
The number of SEUs that occurred within the specified periods 
of an SPE does not necessarily suggest that a significant 
relationship exists between the occurrence of an SEU and 
SPEs. While coronal mass ejections take approximately 1.5—2 
days to reach Earth, the amount of time between interactions of 
energetic particles with components that may eventually lead to 
a SEU is not well understood. The data shown here look at 
these statistics to get a sense for the general occurrence rates.  
 
Figure 8 shows the smoothed sunspot number and the annual 
number of SEUs for satellite fleet B. Fleet B experienced 198

2005, at a period near solar maximum. 
 
Figure 8: The solar cycle and the annual number of SEUs 
per satellite for satellite fleet B. The six different colors 
represent the local and remote computers on each of the 
three satellites in fleet B. An inverse correlation exists 
between the solar cycle and SEUs. 
 
For fleet B, it is clear that more SEUs occur during solar 
minimum, compared with solar maximum. This inverse 
relationship strongly suggests that the single event upsets were 
not primarily caused by solar energetic protons, as we have 
shown in Figure 1 that more solar proton events occur at solar 
maximum. Thus, a more likely source of these SEUs could be 
GCRs, which primarily occur at solar minimum [1].   
 
Similar to Figure 7, Figure 9 is a scatter plot of the SEUs, 
shown with a black asterisk, and the 10 MeV SPEs with rates 
between 10 – 10,000 pfu for fleet B.  
 
The highest concentration of SEUs for fleet B occurs between 
2006 and 2012, and coincides with more than four years of 
zero severe SPE activity. The years 2006 to 2012 also span 
across the solar minimum.

Out of the total 198 SEUs, fifty-four SEUs occurred within one 
month of an SPE. Twenty-three of the fifty-four occur two 
weeks after an SPE, eleven SEUs occurred one week after an 
SPE, and two SEUs occurred one day after an SPE.  
 
Figure 10 shows the age of the satellite at the time of the SEU 
from 1996 to 2012. There are eight total satellites but the 
eleven different colors portray the five satellites of fleet A and 
separately track the local and remote computers on the three 
satellites of fleet B. Throughout this time the total number of 
satellites increases from one to eight and therefore the age of 
the satellites in 2012 ranges from five to fifteen years old. 
Aside from an overall bifurcation between fleet A and fleet B, 
and the influence of the 11-year solar cycle, there does not 
appear to be an obvious correlation between SEUs and the age 
of the satellite. It has been suggested that satellite anomalies are 
more prevalent in the first two years of operation due to “burn-
 in” and transients from the launch and orbital positioning 
activities. However, this does not appear to be a substantial 
contributor to the SEUs on these two satellite fleets.  
 
Figure 10: The age (years) of the five satellites in fleet A 
and the three satellites in fleet B at the time of the SEU. For 
fleet B the SEUs on the local and remote computers are 
plotted separately, which creates 11 separate categories, 
rather than eight. 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
Inmarsat has maintained nominal system operations through 
more than 226 single event upsets on two of its satellite fleets 
since 1996. Satellite fleet A experienced 28 SEUs, and satellite 
fleet B experienced 198 SEUs. The occurrence of these SEUs 
was compared to the occurrence of solar proton events. Ten 
MeV SPEs with rates between 10 – 10,000 pfu are considered 
significant and this level was used as the reference for defining 
an event in this study. 
 
At solar maximum we show there are fewer SEUs than at solar 
minimum, which is when the largest number of SEUs occur. 
We also show that the largest number of SPEs occurred at solar 
maximum, and fewest at solar minimum. Therefore, SEUs on 
the Inmarsat fleet were not found to correlate to solar proton 
events. 
 
There is not a clear correlation between SPEs or SEUs and the 
Bartels solar cycle or the month in which either of these 
phenomena occur.  
  
For fleet A, eleven of the total twenty-eight SEUs occurred one 
month before an SPE. Of these eleven, four SEUs occurred two 
weeks before an SPE and three occurred one week before an 
SPE. No events occurred one day before an SPE. Nine SEUs 
occurred one month after an SPE. Five of these occurred two 
weeks after an SPE, five occurred one week after an SPE, and 
one occurred one day after an SPE. Although fleet A only 
experienced a total of 28 SEUs or 5.6 SEUs per satellite, from 
fleet A we conclude that SEUs do not appear to have a direct 
correlation with energetic proton events.  
 
Adding to our analysis the data from fleet B, which had 198 
SEUs, an average of 66 per satellite, we find a clear inverse 
relationship between SEUs and SPEs. This finding suggests 
that solar energetic protons did not primarily cause the SEUs. 
Thirty-three of the 198 SEUs occurred one month before an 
SPE. Twelve of the 33 SEUs occurred two weeks before an 
SPE, and six occurred one week before an SPE. Zero SEUs 
occurred one day before an SPE. Fifty-four SEUs occurred 
within one month after an SPE. Twenty-three of these occurred 
two weeks after an SPE, eleven occurred one week after an 
SPE, and two SEUs occurred one day after an SPE. 
  
We also note that there is not a clear correlation between SEUs 
and the age of the satellite.   
 
The next step in this work is to investigate the correlation 
between SEUs and GCRs as a function of the 11-year solar 
cycle, as well as to consider correlations between SEUs and 
heavier elements. Further, the results appear to show a notable 
difference in the susceptibility of fleet A and fleet B to SEUs. 
Closer analysis and attention paid to the particular subsystems 
and components most susceptible to SEUs would be valuable 
in explaining this difference and providing information about 
what mitigation methods can be employed, and information 
  
 
about which materials are susceptible to which types and 
energies of particles.
