 Abstract— Big Data is an emerging paradigm covering 
production, collection, processing, analysis, access and 
presentation of huge data-sets: Big Data infrastructures 
represent an opportunity to approach this paradigm on an 
organizational level. We describe challenges and 
opportunities of big data infrastructures for the 
pharmaceutical industry. Pharmaceutical research and 
product development are huge investments and require 
intense exploration and analysis of data. Future trends show 
that pharmaceutical companies need to develop new 
methods of data and information processing to quicker and 
more precisely respond to changing markets and the need of 
patients and providers. The individual case and patients will 
become more influential in healthcare delivery and in 
consequence for the rationale behind these decisions. Our 
approach of a platform for semantic exploitation of BIG 
DATA supports a knowledge based infrastructure for deep 
analysis of clinical information from structured sources and 
clinical narratives. This infrastructure is able to pave the 
way towards the necessary big data-management 
possibilities. Example applications for cancer research will 
be given.

I. INTRODUCTION
 The pharmaceutical industry faces deep challenges [1].
 R&D efforts that lead to successful products 
(“blockbusters”) are unlikely to repeat in the future. Many 
of the successful drugs will run out of patent protection in 
the next few years. Pharma has to re-invent itself and work 
on new therapeutic strategies and improve the existing 
ones. Comparative trials are much more difficult and 
costly than just proving an effect initially.  
Mainly it is the economic perspective that drives new 
inventions. Clinical cancer research for example is 
required to be very specific and targeted on individual 
characteristics. Sometimes the differential information is 
just not available or known. It is a huge effort to identify 
exact genetic conditions or biomarkers that characterize 
the sub-class of tumors successfully. 
Pharmaceutical companies are desperately looking for 
innovation and new business models. It is fairly probable 
that the pharmaceutical industry will not survive based on 
the same strategy to produce drugs that target a symptom 
or illness that is accompanied by a low probability for 
success. There is a tendency to personalize therapies or to 
follow outcome oriented strategies. 
II. OUTCOME ORIENTED MEDICINE
 We define outcome as the final result of all medical 
interventions, procedures and collaborations in medicine. 
Outcome has indeed always been the main driver behind 
medical science. However it has been measured in a very 
coarse scale. Medical science applies statistics and 
scientific procedures like randomized controlled trials to 
produce and describe outcome measures. The notion to 
understand medicine in terms of a population is not wrong 
but implies that experience with many patients tells a story 
about individual patients too.  
This notion is changing and picks up possibilities, 
inventions and models from a broad scale of sciences. 
Looking at the individual in a more precise and 
straightforward way is an approach that is included in 
approaches like personalized and/or patient-centered 
medicine. The level of detail needed to perform individual 
or personalized medicine is much higher. The results are 
not measured in terms of large groups but for any 
individual patient. For example the result of a therapy may 
be to extend the life of a patient for some month on 
average. This may not be relevant for an individual patient. 
Identifying the goals and characteristics of individual 
patients requires much more analysis and collaboration 
between healthcare providers and patients.  
On the other hand more data and information is needed 
to identify individual traits of patients in order to separate 
them from a population. Outcome oriented approaches 
consider genetic information they may be linked to the 
health record of the patients in order to stratify a 
population for a therapy [2]. 
III. FROM BIG DATA TO BIG INFORMATION IN THE FIELD 
OF CANCER RESEARCH
 According to the data management criteria listed below 
not every medical discipline delivers the needed precision 
or detail to perform deep personalization. The other crucial 
dimension is diversity and origin of data. The human 
capability to integrate huge amount of diverse information 
is incomparable. It is difficult to do this integration with 
2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data
 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 59
computerized information systems. The example of cancer 
research shows that diagnostics and procedures are already 
available to produce a greater level of detail to power 
personalized medicine. 
A. State of the art of oncological research data 
administration  
The amount of data acquired during patient’s medical 
treatments is immense. For example, data of tissue 
analyses, medical imaging, and haemograms, etc. add up 
to terabytes of medical data depending on the specific 
diagnostic approach. On top of that the often very long 
medical history of cancer patients adds additional volume 
and complexity. Especially in large hospitals and 
university medical centers lots of additional data is 
generated by the scientific staff.  
These data become more and more relevant as it is 
often generated from patient specific tumor tissue. The big 
challenge today is an “iron curtain” separating clinical 
from scientific data. Scientific data is usually administered 
within individual, separate working groups, eventually 
uploaded to project specific servers and private clouds.  
In smaller projects, data management is often realized 
using wikis or similar content management systems - 
systems managing arbitrary contents of web pages. For 
large-scale projects, more professional solutions are 
needed. In cases where pharmaceutical companies 
participate in these projects their proprietary in-house 
solutions are commonly used. 
B. Current topics and their relationship to data 
management  
All of the following topics are influencing the 
requirements on management of big data. We mention a 
few of them to document that there is no generic way to 
understand big data management. Origin, structure and 
processes are influencing the way how big data 
management should be analyzed and understood. 
‚ High throughput of sequencing data. Within the 
next 10 years sequencing cancer genomes will 
become clinical routine in Germany and large 
parts of Europe. Today these technologies are 
mainly applied within a scientific environment, 
meaning that the processes and data management 
procedures are largely established by the needs of 
scientist and not by medical practitioners and/or 
patients. 
‚ International collaborations. Large, multinational 
research projects have been shown to be way more 
effective than smaller initiatives. Yet, their full 
potential has still to be unleashed by cross-national 
unified, data management and data protection 
strategies. 
‚ Data protection and security. Data protection is a 
challenge in many ways. Indeed there are so many 
diverse aspects regarding data security that this 
justifies a separate discussion. To mention just a 
few that show the influence of data security aspect 
on big data management. These aspects strike 
process, quality and intention of big data usage 
and management: 
1. Incidental finding must not be reported to the 
treating physician or the patient directly. 
2. Different countries have dissenting laws of 
the degree of data protection.  
3. In Germany there is no opt-out for this. 
Again there is no generic way to handle access and 
management of big data-sets for data security. The 
requirements need to be analyzed for particular 
applications in the big data domain. 
C. Future goals of oncological research 
Genomics is surely one of the most important 
influences on the outcome oriented and personalized 
clinical research. The tendency to understand and integrate 
clinical records with information from the patient’s own 
genome sequence together with the transfer of innovation 
back to medical services will lead to a stratified medicine 
[2][3]. Stratification breaks down a population into distinct 
subpopulations where each population may receive 
different treatments for the same diagnosis. It is not very 
improbable that today’s notion of diagnosis based on the 
population as a whole may have to be revisited too. 
IV. BIG DATA 
All these influences from clinical medicine, 
pharmaceutical drug development and medical research 
require huge quantities of data and information from 
heterogeneous sources. BIG DATA is a term that describes 
data-sets that are too big to be managed with common 
tools and procedures used for smaller data-sets. Not only 
origin but also processing may include spatial distribution 
of data and of course different data formats. Based on the 
above description of practices the goal of management 
strategies should always be defined according to the use 
case supported. Big data management inherits more 
generic tasks from general data management like 
‚ Collection 
‚ Storage 
‚ Integration, Curation 
‚ Access, Retrieval 
‚ Scalability, Distribution 
of data.  
However in order to deliver the value proposition of 
innovation and improvement for the pharmaceutical 
industry or cancer research the data-management alone is 
not enough. The value delivered by big-data sets comes 
from in depth comprehensive and value generating 
processing cycles with constant exchange and update of 
the informational value extracted from big data-sets [4] 
60
‚ automatic data collection e.g. harvesting data from 
distributed repositories 
‚ support for conversion to standard formats. E.g. 
special markup languages used in a particular 
domain 
‚ upload to public repositories 
‚ data organization and modeling  like data 
warehouses and semantic web. E.g. support for 
tagging and annotation of data in RDF [5] or OWL 
[6] 
‚ Access control. E.g. controlling and auditing  
access across organizations 
‚ Possibility for extension of functionality to access 
and process more data-sources. E.g. text-mining to 
access information from unstructured texts 
‚ Support for collaboration across organizations 
Figure 1. BIG DATA Process 
We document such s cycle in Figure 1. It shows the 
iteration on data collection in a structured way.  
‚ collect data from various sources based on 
domain models 
‚ extract information based on the application 
or research question according to the domain 
model  
‚ associate or link the information with the 
already existing fact base 
‚ optionally update domain models or 
ontologies if there is new information 
contained in the data that has not been 
recognized so far 
‚ discover new information according to model 
change 
‚ integrate and update information in fact base 
and prepare new iteration 
Being able to collect and process big data-sets in a 
value-oriented process supports a continuous cycle of 
discovery of new information. This is mainly what drives 
technological development behind the big data paradigm. 
Among the many aspects of the big data revolution in 
healthcare the value-oriented processing and seamless  
integration of data and  information generated by machine 
with those authored by human beings has the biggest 
impact on innovation in healthcare [7].  
Human contribution is independent of its intention, e.g. 
text, speech, collaboration. Everything may be processed 
according to the contributing value it contains. 
It is necessary to rethink organizational models and 
governance structures of all organizations participating in 
healthcare and scientific research in order to maximize the 
value. The separation of clinical and scientific data (‘iron 
curtain’) is just one example of a barrier to innovation.
 Another one is the traditional exclusion of patients from 
shared decisions or participation in healthcare delivery. 
Patient participation and empowerment together with the 
improvement of health literacy in healthcare delivery will 
boost outcomes [8].      
V. A PLATFORM FOR SEMANTIC EXPLOITATION OF BIG
 DATA 
Our approach for a platform that integrates and 
processes big data-sets is based on the semantic 
exploitation of clinical data collected from various 
resources like hospital information systems, clinical 
narratives, scientific literature and collaboration platforms.  
This platform is developed within a joint project with 
Charité and Vivantes, - Europe’s leading healthcare 
providers - and ORTEC medical GmbH. Main driver for 
development is the support for cohort identification in 
clinical trials for recruitment and feasibility studies but is 
not limited to specific use cases. It supports the flexible 
and just-in-time exploitation of clinical data from various 
sources, including clinical texts, to leverage unlimited 
clinical or patient-centered use cases. Knowledge is 
represented by ontologies and engineered by the domain 
experts themselves in a straightforward manner in a 
semantic workbench. Semantically enriched facts are 
processed by domain-specific applications that support 
specific use cases. Semantic exploitation of clinical data 
from structured HIS records and clinical texts provides an 
up-to-date evidence base for medical research and 
healthcare delivery.  
61
Figure 2. Platform architecture 
Physicians and medical experts are able to engineer 
ontologies and adapt the knowledge needed by an 
application or use case. For example, patient recruitment 
scenarios require knowledge that represents study criteria 
for case selection. The knowledge engineering process 
itself is always done by validating data and ontologies in 
an iterative fashion supporting a round-trip engineering. 
Ontologies can always be validated and tested against the 
real data flowing into the system from structured sources 
or clinical texts. E.g. experts identify ontological concepts 
in texts by just scraping and annotating them. 
Cross-cut concerns like collaboration on individual 
facts, semantic patients records or ontologies support the 
required flexible administration and collaboration across 
organizations.  
The data integration and annotation possibilities of this 
platform address lots of the requirements for the 
management of big data. 
Platform and applications are currently piloted in 
various departments of  Charité and Vivantes [9]. 
VI. CONSEQUENCES FOR PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH
 Given that scientific progress in oncology is a good 
candidate for improvement of medical procedures on a 
more detailed level the results provide a powerful force to 
drive change regarding the challenges for pharma. The 
tendency to support individual aspects in clinical research 
and drug development is reforming the way healthcare is 
delivered and the pharmaceutical industry may focus on 
their core competencies to drive that change. The technical 
possibilities are available however the intelligent 
application and iterative deployment in changing 
disciplines is an ongoing challenge.  
Achieving conditional licenses based on trials 
performed on small cohorts [10][11] is only the beginning  
of a tendency to  
Figure 3. Ontology Engineering Process 
close the information gap between scientific reasoning and 
the methods that help to approve and market the products 
of these efforts. We believe the possibilities to digest and 
enrich information is a crucial step in rightsizing clinical 
research and healthcare delivery. The technical 
requirements for that is the possibility to manage big data-
 sets with the aspects listed above. However innovation can 
only be successful if it picks up the necessary culture and 
promotes innovative people and mind-sets. For the 
pharmaceutical industry this might imply 
‚ Rethink the provision for the pharmaceutical 
industry away from drug delivery alone [12] 
‚ Promote collaboration and value-oriented research 
between all stake-holders in healthcare 
‚ Cooperate to establish new regulatory models and 
procedures that follow the proposition of value-
 oriented and personalized medicine 
‚ Educate and perceive patients as partners in 
healthcare and research 
There are already some examples that adopt models of 
shared innovation [13][14]. One important aspects of these 
models is also the collaboration with patients. Patient-
 Centered-Infrastructures [16] are technological perspective 
for patient-oriented and outcome-oriented services in 
research and healthcare delivery. Information as a first 
level resource in healthcare reaches the significance of 
therapies as it directly influences outcomes. The tendency 
to break down the risky model of information silos which 
are based on the false and dangerous understanding of 
values and markets is under way. To appreciate patients as 
a partner and a valuable source of information at least in 
chronic conditions influences outcomes [8] and is a way to 
change the economic situation of the healthcare system 
too[15].
 VII. CONCLUSION
 Establish big data strategies for the pharmaceutical 
industry may unlock a multitude of possibilities. The goal 
of outcome-oriented research and medicine directly 
applies these possibilities to improve outcomes and the 
62
economic impact of research and healthcare in general. 
However the transition from a drug research oriented 
market approach and clinical trials culture that addresses 
big markets to a fine grained and personalized 
development of market offers is not easy. The required 
technology is available. We propose a platform for 
semantic exploitation of big data which may contribute to 
a large-scale integration of data from various sources in 
the healthcare domain. Finding the right way to apply 
these technological possibilities in order to drive 
innovation is still to be done. Patients should perceived as 
a partner and collaborate in research, innovation and 
healthcare delivery. Breaking down the informational 
barriers of information is a necessary step to learn about 
the possibilities for applying big data strategies for 
innovation.
