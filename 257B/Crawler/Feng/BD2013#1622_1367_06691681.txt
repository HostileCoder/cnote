Abstract—Financial statements of all listed and over the 
counter (OTC) companies collected by stock exchange 
represent valuable big open data. Therefore, automatic 
processing and analyzing such big data would create 
tremendous added value economically. In this paper, we design 
and implement a cloud service for evaluating company's 
financial health using XBRL-based financial statements 
collected by Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TWSE). 
The XBRL-based financial statements are parsed and stored as 
key-value pairs into MongoDB, which is a kind of NoSQL 
database. The proposed system is designed using three-tier 
architecture for flexibility and maintainability. It also provides 
user-friendly interface with various charts. The proposed 
system indeed demonstrates powerful benefits of implementing 
interactive data using XBRL for financial disclosure 
documents in big data era. 
Keywords-XBRL, Financial statements, Financial health 
evaluation, MongoDB, NoSQL 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
The convergence of cloud computing and big data is 
changing the world and will have far-reaching implications 
on technological area. When large amounts of data are 
collected in the cloud data center for processing, a standard 
machine-readable format for data representation is one of the 
critical requirements. As a result, XML (eXtensible Markup 
Language) is widely accepted as a standard for exchange of 
information over the Internet, and it has grown into a big 
family of specifications. For instance, XBRL (eXtensible 
Business Reporting Language), which is a global standard 
for exchanging business information, is an XML-based 
language. Since the hierarchical structure of XML and the 
relational data models are not fully compatible, the NoSQL 
database, which provides a mechanism for storage and 
retrieval of "unstructured data", are developed to address that 
issue. NoSQL is often used for storing big data and 
designing real-time web applications. There are many 
NoSQL databases, such as MongoDB [1], CouchDB [2], 
RethinkDB [3], Cassandra [4], and so on. 
As data grows at an astonishing rate, data analytics need 
to be developed to produce valuable insights of business data. 
Before the introduction of XBRL, most of the financial 
statements are reported in the formats of HTML, PDF, Word, 
or EXCEL that are not suitable for automatic processing. 
Therefore, XBRL was developed in 1998 as a business 
reporting language. Since then, a growing list of government 
agencies and other entities have also begun to incorporate 
XBRL into their disclosure systems, including US SEC, 
Australia, Committee of European Banking Supervisors 
(CEBS), United Kingdom, Japan, Taiwan, etc.  
 The development of the proposed system is a result of 
2013 XBRL Software Design Competition hosted by TWSE 
in which our team won the national championship. The 
characteristics of the proposed systems can be described as 
follows: 
‚ It is a Web-based service system which allows users 
to use services through browser without installing 
any other application. It can also be deployed as 
SaaS service supporting different kinds of user 
devices including smart phones. 
‚ Taking into account of big data problem, a NoSQL 
database, MongoDB, is used for data storage. 
‚ It adopts three-tier system architecture with newly 
developed API for flexibility and maintainability. 
‚ The results of financial health evaluation are 
presented using five different light bulbs for easy 
understanding. 
‚ It provides user-friendly interface with various charts, 
such as bar, radar, and trends, for users to interact in 
a natural and intuitive way. 
II. RELATED WORK 
In this section, we will describe the development of 
XBRL and the concept of NoSQL, including MongoDB.  
A. The development of XBRL 
XBRL was first developed by a consortium created by 
AICPA (American Institute of CPAs) in 1998, and in recent 
years, it is accepted as a standard business reporting 
language worldwide. The first recommendation, version 1.0 , 
was published in 2000. The version 2.0 was published in 
2001. The current recommended specification is version 2.1 
[5]. The well-defined format of XBRL provides machine-
 readable tags to exchange and transfer business information 
across individual computation platforms [6]. The XBRL 
taxonomies are the reporting-area specific hierarchical 
dictionaries used by the XBRL community [7]. Different 
taxonomies or taxonomy extensions will be required for 
different business reporting purposes. For example, some 
4235"KGGG"Kpvgtpcvkqpcn"Eqphgtgpeg"qp"Dki"Fcvc"
 32978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013  IEEE 
national jurisdictions define their taxonomies to reflect local 
accounting and other reporting regulations. With the 
development of XBRL, it has increased the financial report 
transparency across companies and achieves the important 
financial disclosures. Currently, XBRL is being used across 
a wide range of sectors, including securities regulation, 
banking, insurance, data aggregators and taxation, as well as 
for non-financial reporting such as carbon disclosure, 
sustainability efforts and risk reporting. [5]
 Although the development of best practices in the use of 
XBRL is still in the early stages, there are many researches
 that have been published to analyze the concept, benefits,
 and applications of XBRL from different perspectives [8-14].
 For example, Callaghan et al. [11] presents a framework for 
augmenting the XBRL documents through the use of UML 
constructs to increase utilization of XBRL documents in 
financial analysis and decision-making.  Murthy and 
Groomer [12] present a continuous auditing web services 
(CAWS) model that uses the emerging XML Web services 
framework to support a "pull model" of continuous auditing 
in a world of XML-enabled accounting systems, such as
 XBRL GL and business process execution language for web 
services (BPEL4WS). Stivason et al. [13] propose a User 
Defined Account Model (UDAM), which allows users to 
determine which measure they would like to employ by 
accessing the primary measures and compiling financial 
statements in any format they desire. O'Riain et al. [14] 
argue that linked data technology can accommodate XBRL 
data and make it easier to combine it with open datasets.
 They proposed a system that provides a middleware for
 offering useful queries by converting XBRL to RDF
 (Resource Description Framework), which is then integrated
 with the other linked open data.
 Some business application systems for XBRL have also 
been developed. Fujitsu has leveraged XBRL in its own 
financial reporting and built the XBRL's Global Ledger 
(XBRL-GL) framework [15] with a standardized view of the 
ERP system data. Altova has extended the reach of its XML 
development tools with support for XBRL [16]. SAP 
delivers the BusinessObjects XBRL Publishing [17] to 
enable easier communication of financial and business data.
 Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TWSE) adopted 
XBRL in 2008 by announcing a demonstration platform [18] 
at the end of that year, and then requested all listed 
companies to report their financial statements in XBRL 
format starting from 2010. 
B. NoSQL and MongoDB
 "Big Data" relates to data creation, storage, retrieval and 
analysis that are impractical or impossible to manage with 
traditional software tools. New technologies like NoSQL,
 referred to as "Not only SQL", databases are frequently used 
to store big data. They are suitable for dynamic data 
structures and are highly scalable without categorizing and 
parsing the data into a fixed schema [19]. The NoSQL 
database aims to address the shortcomings of relational 
databases and the demands of modern software development. 
One of the leading NoSQL database is MongoDB [1],
 which is a document database. A database of MongoDB 
contains collections, which hold a set of documents. A 
document is represented as a BSON (Binary JSON) structure, 
i.e., a list of key-value pairs. The value can be of three types: 
a primitive value, an array of documents or again a list of 
key-value pairs. It is why the MongoDB can work with 
dynamic schemas. MongoDB provides four basic database 
operations (i.e. Core MongoDB Operations, CRUD), which
 stands for create, read, update, and delete, for application 
development. To query these documents, the client can set 
filters on the collections expressed as a list of key-value pairs.
 The queries are also JSON structured and it is possible for 
query nested fields. 
III. METHODOLOGY OF PROPOSED SYSTEM
 A. System Architecture
 The workflow of the proposed system is shown in Figure 
1. We designed a Web crawler to collect the original XBRL 
documents from the Market Observation Post System in 
Taiwan (http://mops.twse.com.tw/server-java/t147sb02).  
Then, the XBRL documents are parsed and stored in 
MongoDB. The financial health evaluation system is 
deployed in Microsoft Azure and provides the service as a 
SaaS.  
Figure 1. Workflow of the proposed system. 
B. Data processing
 An example of XBRL document is shown in Figure 2.
 An XBRL taxonomy is an industry-specific categorization
 scheme. We use XBRL Java API [20] to parse XBRL 
documents. In order to speed up query processing and 
support scalability, we choose MongoDB to manage the 
financial data. Since the value of a key-value pair can be  
another list of key-value pairs, it is compatible with the 
hierarchical structure of the xml-based document. A 
snapshot of XBRL in MogoDB is shown in Figure 3.  
C. System Development
 Since the financial data are constantly increased and the 
functional modules are also potentially changeable, a three-
 tier architecture is adopted as our system’s fundamental 
architecture. As shown in Figure 4, the system provides 
abstraction among the presentation layer, logic layer, and the 
data layer, which makes our system more flexible and
 maintainable in the lifetime of the system.

D. Financial Health Lights and Indicators
 The financial health of a company is comprised of six
 dimensions: capital structure, repayment ability, ability to 
benefit, operation efficiency, ability to growth, and cash-flow.
 Each dimension involves several financial ratios, which are 
listed in Table I. The financial ratios can help to make sense 
of the overwhelming amount of information that can be 
found in a company's financial statements, and the formulas
 of all financial ratios can be found in most of the finance 
books. The performance of financial ratio and the six 
dimensions of financial health are finally represented by five 
different light bulbs. The derivation steps are performed as 
follows. 
1) Calculate the scale of performance for each financial 
ratio: The scale of a ratio depends on the industry average 
over the same period and the value of year-over-year. The 
scale of the financial ratio rp is calculated by Equation (1),
 where ry,i denotes the value of a financial ratio r over i-th 
quarter of the year y, and I(r)y,i indicates the the industry 
average of r over i-th quarter of the year y. 
" rp =[(ry,i – ry-1,i)/ ry-1,i +( ry,i – I(r)y,i )/ I(r)y,i ]/2" *3+"
 2) Translate the scales to financial health light bulbs: 
Five different light bulbs are used to represent the "financial 
health", i.e., red, yellow-red, green, yellow-blue, and blue. 
We grades five indicators from one to five points, and each 
light bulb has its grade-point scale. Table II lists the
 mapping between scale and grade, as well as the meanings 
of light bulbs. 
3) Aggregate financial ratios to six dimensions:
 According to the classification in Table I, we can express 
the financial health in each dimension by averaging the 
scales of the corresponding financial ratios. The results are 
also represented by light bulbs as shown in Table II.

 IV. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION
 For system implementation, we adopt three-tier system 
architecture to simplify the application development process.
 A web crawler is developed to collect the XBRL instance 
documents, including the financial statements of all listed 
and OTC companies from the first quarter of 2010 to the 
fourth quarter of 2012, from the Market Observation Post 
System in Taiwan. The XBRL instance documents are 
parsed and stored in MongoDB. All the development tools 
are listed in Figure 5, including some newly developed APIs 
for flexibility and maintainability. This system had been 
deployed in Microsoft Windows Azure cloud platform for 
testing. It is now maintained at
 http://xbrl.dmlab.cs.nchu.edu.tw.
 Figure 5. Development tools for three-tier architecture.
 Because the system is intended to be used by Taiwanese 
users, the user interface uses Chinese characters. Figure 6 is
 one snapshot of the proposed system. The area numbered "1" 
shows three ways to display financial information: for single 
company, for multi-company comparison, and for user-
 defined filters, from top to down. For example, when we 
chose to view the financial health of a company and pressed 
the top button in area "1", all we need to do is setting 
required entries in area "2", i.e., the target industry, company, 
year, and quarter. Then press the "submit" button.  The 
results will be shown in area "3". The evaluation of 
company’s financial health is represented in terms of six 
dimensions and one overall performance. Each one is 
presented using five different light bulbs based on the 
calculation described in Section III-D, steps 2-3). The grades
 and the meanings of light bulbs are also listed on the left side 
of the web page to assist users’ understanding. The button 
numbered "4" can be clicked to show the corresponding 
radar chart. The buttons in area "5" provides detailed 
information for each dimension. 
As an example, Figure 7 shows the evaluation results of 
the "Capital Structure" dimension. The detailed information
 of six financial ratios is in the area "6". The calculation of the 
scale of performance for each financial ratio is described in 
Section III-D, step 1). The system also provides bar chart and 
trend chart for each ratio as in numbered "7" and "8", 
respectively. 
V. CONCLUSION
 In this paper, a cloud service for evaluation of company’s 
financial health based on XBRL-tagged financial statements
 is designed and developed with emphasis on three-tier 
system architecture and NoSQL database. The proposed 
system provides user-friendly interface that makes 
complicated financial data easy to understand. It indeed 
demonstrates tremendous benefits of implementing 
interactive data using XBRL for financial information in big 
data era.
