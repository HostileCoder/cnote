CTS 2013 PREFACE 
 
Welcome to the 2013 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS 2013).  During 
the conference, attendees will see and interact with a broad spectrum of methodologies and technologies that 
relate to cooperation, coordination, communication, and collaboration at both the client and backend (cloud) 
levels.  This year’s conference presents a wide array of papers, posters, workshops, panels, demonstrations, 
exhibits, presentations, and tutorials addressing a broad range of topics including sensors, robots, people, and 
social networks, big data, biology knowledgebase, groupware, citizen science, crowd sourcing, human-computer 
interaction, visualization, virtual environments, user interfaces, gaming, e-learning, e-business, e-health, 
emergency response, knowledge management, decision making using clouds, global grids, P2P, multi-agent 
systems, mobile clients, wearable devices, Web 2.0, with resilience, trust and security, and related human and 
socio-technical collaboration issues.  
 
Today’s computer and information technologies see dramatic progress in both lightweight clients and megascale 
backend systems (clouds) supporting them. This supports seamless and borderless information delivery and 
services for anyone, anywhere, and anytime. The international free flow of information is having huge socio-
 political impacts on countries where strict censorship and limits on information and news exchange had been 
traditionally and culturally accepted. World-wide, people expect unlimited access to information within and 
across cultures.  Social networking continues to expand, even at the enterprise level, and businesses are struggling 
to devise policies on the appropriate use of applications such as Facebook, Twitter, blogs, and texting. The desire 
for mobile and pervasive connectivity is pushing expansion of an ever growing wired and wireless high speed 
backbone that globally combines computing, sensing, and communication technologies. Annually, new classes of 
mobile devices are added to the traditional desktop, notebook computers, tablet PCs, and netbooks.  Most recently 
multi-modal touch screen devices, pioneered by Apple’s iPhone ™ and iPad ™ with comparable importance of 
Android-based systems, have significantly improved the ease of use of personal collaboration instruments.  The 
new mobile devices provide immediate access to people, email, entertainment and knowledge and have created a 
marketplace for hundreds of thousands of new applications.  The Internet of Things captures the growing 
importance of sensor swarms; often attached to one’s smartphone or wristwatch. These applications are enabled 
by backend clouds but their utility depends on their value to people. 
 
Underlying infrastructure such as cloud computing, service oriented architectures, and smart networks and grids 
offer the vision of resources (networks, computational servers, storage, etc.) as a service with greater ease to 
collaborate and while also lowering cost. At the same time, there are increasing challenges for privacy and 
security as we attempt to understand how to handle trust in complex systems and how to measure trustworthiness 
in human to human, human to machine, machine to human, and machine to machine collaboration.   
 
CTS is the premier international research conference in the major areas related to collaboration, communication 
and their underlying technologies.  It offers an exceptional opportunity to interact with world class researchers in 
collaboration and related arenas and discuss the results of the best research in the domain.  The conference gives 
us insight into what collaboration is today and what 21st century collaboration will be based on technologies now 
in research and development.  We hope you enjoy and learn from the tremendous exchange of ideas and concepts 
that will be presented in this year’s conference sessions.

CTS 2013 PROGRAM MESSAGE 
 
 
On behalf of the Organizing and International Technical Program Committees, we are delighted to present these 
proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Collaboration Technologies and Systems (CTS 2013) and its 
program.  This year is the 14th anniversary of the CTS conferences.  We are pleased to have this milestone and 
look forward to continuous contributions to the community and bringing the state-of-the-art in research and 
development in this domain.   
 
The conference this year is held May 20-24, in San Diego, California, USA.  The meeting provides a dynamic 
forum to address, explore, and exchange information, knowledge, and experiences in the state-of-the-art 
collaborative enterprises, their modeling and simulation, design and use, and impact.  The goal of CTS meetings 
is to bring together researchers, scientists, engineers, practitioners, educators, and students from many nations and 
backgrounds to share and exchange their insights, breakthroughs, and research results about various aspects of 
collaboration systems and technologies; to discuss challenges encountered in government, industry, and academe; 
and to seek new and innovative solutions.  Additionally, we hope that the Conference will provide opportunities 
for many open technical interchanges in individual and group settings on key technology issues.  It is our hope 
that the Conference will provide opportunities for future collaborations among the participants.  
 
This year, and despite the continuation of the challenging times, the CTS Conference is run with parallel sessions 
over a period of four days, including one full day of parallel tutorials.  For the fifth year, we have full day parallel 
sessions on all days of the conference to accommodate the number of presentations we have this year.  As in 
previous years’ successful meetings, the Conference continues to enjoy excellent growth and a diverse program.  
The Proceedings contains papers on many timely and emerging topics.  We received a good number of 
submissions and the quality of the overall manuscripts pool was excellent.  There was a total of 153 paper 
submissions to main and all other tracks from 37 countries.  The top five countries with most submissions were: 
the USA with about 36%, followed by Italy (9.6%) France (7.4%), Germany (4.8%), and Saudi Arabia (4%).  In 
the main track, each manuscript underwent a minimum of four rigorous reviews plus two independent 
evaluations.  It was a challenge to select papers for inclusion in the proceedings.  The acceptance rate this year 
was about 34.21% (26 papers were accepted in the main track out of 76 submitted).  Sixty-one manuscripts were 
accepted in the symposia, workshops and special sessions, 8 invited talks, 4 poster papers, 3 doctoral dissertation 
colloquium abstracts, and 6 research posters abstracts.  The Conference had ten symposia, workshops and special 
sessions, all with rigorously reviewed papers (a minimum of three reviews per manuscript).  Each of the 
symposia, workshops and special sessions handled their papers separately but maintained similar standards for 
paper evaluation and acceptance as much as possible.  These proceedings include a total of 104 contributions 
(regular papers, short papers, poster papers, extended abstracts, etc.), both invited and accepted from the 
submissions.  The program’s technical papers represent works from academia, research laboratories, government, 
practitioners, and industry.   
 
The five-day final program is strong and diverse.  It consists of an opening remarks session, four keynote 
speeches, a plenary session, four tutorial sessions, three demo sessions, twenty-five technical sessions, a posters 
session, three panel sessions, a Doctoral Dissertation Colloquium (DDC) session, a conference reception, a 
luncheon and a banquet dinner, three meet & greet sessions, nine short breaks, exhibits, and three other social 
events, including full-day excursions to Balboa Park, the San Diego Zoo, and the San Diego Safari Park.  For the 
fourth time, we have three doctoral dissertation presentations as part of the DD Colloquium.  We hope that the 
DDC will provide a useful mentoring opportunity to our future researchers and leaders. Throughout the program, 
students continue to be involved in various activities.

submissions.  We also recognize the contribution and support of the CTS 2013 exhibitors and sponsors who made 
many of the Conference’s activities possible.  Last but not least, we wish to thank all members of the Organizing 
Committee and student assistants without whom this conference would not have been possible.   
 
On behalf of the organizers, the ITPC and all those who made CTS 2013 a reality, we hope you find this volume
