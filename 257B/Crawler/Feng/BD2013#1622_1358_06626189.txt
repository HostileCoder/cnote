Abstract—In recent years, cities in China have achieved 
unprecedented development. Up to 2011, there have been an 
urban population of 691 million, and emerged several mega-city 
regions, such as Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong - Shenzhen - 
Guangzhou etc. For the significant, large-scale economy and 
population cluster effect, mega-city regions have become 
important engines for promoting economic growth and social 
development. With the hyperactive urban construction, 
overwhelming urban scale and rapid population growth, there 
occurs more and more urban geological problems in land 
utilization, resource supply, environmental protection, hazards 
prevention and cure in many cities, which become big threats to 
urban geological safety and constraints on the urban sustainable 
development. For all cities are constructed on geological objects, 
the support of Urban Geology is necessary for urban 
development, and urban geological information has irreplaceable 
basic role for rapid development of mega-city regions. There is 
an increasing requirement for the intellectualized, integrated, 
multi-dimensional and quick-response geological safety 
supporting system for mega-city regions (GSSSMR) based on the 
technologies of large spatial databases, GIS, virtual reality and 
networks, etc., meeting the need of guaranteeing geological 
resources and geological environment safety, and urban planning, 
construction, management, mitigating and preventing disasters, 
etc. After analyzing the requirements of geological information 
and GSSSMR, we introduce the architecture of GSSSMR. At last, 
based on the research in this paper, the development and 
applications of GSSSMR in Beijing, China are presented.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Cities in China have achieved an unprecedented 
development in recent years. Up to 2011, the urban population 
and urbanization rate have reached 691 million and 51.27%, 
respectively [1]. It is the first time that the urbanization broke 
through 50% line. And this has formed several mega-city 
regions with the population of 120 million such as Hong Kong 
– Shenzhen – Guangzhou region [2]. 
For the impacts of information technology, communication 
technology, and capital flows, there is more essential element 
and economic centralization in mega-city regions compared 
with other small cities. And China has approved a development 
plan of 14 regions such as Pearl River Delta, Beibu Gulf, 
Hainan International Travel Island, etc. According to the 
predication of McKinsey Global Institute [3], urban population 
in China will reach 1 billion, and more than 221 cities will have 
a population of over a million by 2025.  
Although mega-city regions have become important 
engines for promoting economic growth and social 
development with the significant large-scale economy and 
population cluster effect, there occur more and more geological 
problems in utilization of urban land, resource development, 
waste disposal, environment protection and natural disaster 
prevention. 
The fact that cities are built on geological objects 
determines that urban development is closely connected with 
the basic support of Urban Geological Survey (UGS). Up to 
now, lots of cities in China have carried out UGS, and 
accumulated lots of data in basic geology, engineering geology, 
hydrogeology, geochemistry and geological disaster, etc. 
However, the huge potential value of geological data has not 
been fully exploited. In this case, the quick response GSSSMR, 
taking advantage of the latest achievements of modern 
information technology such as huge spatial database, GIS, 3D 
visualization and internet, is extremely urgent for guaranteeing 
geological resources and geological environment safety and 
realizing sustainable development. 
II. THE REQUIREMENT ANALYSIS OF GSSSMR FOR MEGA-
 CITY REGIONS  
Mega-city regions are the new urban models emerged in the 
early 21st century. Specifically, Mega-city regions are 
comprised of a series of 20 to 50 cities, which are separated 
from themselves and connected with their function [4]. They 
gather around the one or more large central cities, and show 
great economic power by the new division of labor function.  
Cites is the most active regions of economic activity. Urban 
geological data, as the important achievement of UGS, are the 
necessary basic information for urban planning, construction, 
management, mitigating and preventing disasters. They have 
the following characteristics:  
Supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant 
No. 41202238/40742015), China Postdoctoral Foundation (No. 20060400348). 
? Multi-element. This characteristic can be divided into 
three subtypes. Multi-resources: Compared with other 
geological investigations, UGS may mostly have a 
higher degree of exploration and accumulate more 
geological data. These data include both original data, 
such as drill data, geophysical exploration data, 
geochemical exploration data, and interpreted data, 
such as cross-sections, geological maps. Multi-format: 
Considering the data storage formats, there are 
numeric data, maps, documents, pictures, images, etc. 
in the modeling. Multi-type: 3DUGMS include spatial 
data, property data and textures etc. They are located 
aboveground or underground. Natural and man-made 
models are all included.  
? Multi-thematic: The data in 3DUGM are collected 
from diverse thematic areas, such as bedrock, 
hydrogeology, engineering geology, geochemistry, 
geophysics, geological disasters, stratigraphy, etc. The 
independent and integrated representation and analysis 
of each thematic data are all needed.  
? Multi-dimensional: The 2.5D DEM data, 3D 
geological structure models, 3D geological property 
models and even the 4D dynamic models, for example, 
dynamic representation of underground water level 
change, all occur here.  
? Multi-scale: For different applications with different 
data accuracy, UGS is concerned with different scale 
data. For example, large scale models are necessary in 
the construction engineering, while small scale models 
may be enough in urban planning.  
? Massive Data: For the storage of 3D information, data 
quantity here, often up to TB, is often more than that 
in 2D GIS. The ability of managing and operating 
massive data is needed.  
? Complex data association: Complex data association 
is common in urban geological investigation data, for 
example, several samples or tests may be referred to 
one field investigation point. 
The rapid development of the mega-city regions has led to 
more serious resources and environment problems with the 
following features compared to the small cities:  
? As construction projects become extremely active in 
mega-city regions, the forward-looking geological 
information are urgently required for set selection, 
construction, management of some major projects 
such as new regions, subways and intercity high-
 speed rail, etc.  
? Some related issues in mega-city regions are more 
prominent. Firstly, the more dense population leads 
to more severe effect of the geological disasters and 
environmental pollution. As a result,  the additional 
geological work are required, such as the geological 
hazard risk assessment, dynamic monitoring and 
real-time forecasting and warning of land subsidence, 
active fault, landslide and groundwater, etc. The 
second is the solid waste disposal site section. For 
example, domestic wastes in Beijing in 2009 have 
reached 6.69 million tons. The amount is so much 
that the landfill site has to be chosen carefully for the 
worry of water, soil, and air pollution. Thirdly, the 
evaluation of groundwater resources and the 
emergency water source selection should be 
strengthened. Lastly, as land resources are becoming 
scarcer, it will be inevitable of the exploitation and 
utilization of underground space in the mega-city 
regions. 
? In mega-city regions, more effective and refining 
management is needed. And scientific and 
technological means, such as IT, will be utilized to 
achieve the quick response of the geological 
information services and sharing.  
? For there are more qualified personnel in mega-city 
regions, public will have more requirements for the 
geological information sharing, such as the periodic 
bulletins of urban geological environmental quality. 
? Urban geological data center, which is responsible 
for the collection, integration and management of the 
multi-element, heterogeneous and mass geological 
data, are required more urgently. 
In summary, GSSSMR, an organic part of Digital City, 
aims to build an intellectualized, integrated, multi-dimensional 
and quick response urban geological safety supporting 
information system for satisfying urban planning, construction, 
management, mitigating and preventing disasters, etc. These 
features can be summarized as follows: 
? An efficient management platform for the gathering, 
searching, compiling and updating of multi-themes, 
multi-elements, heterogeneous and mass urban 
geological data.  
? An intelligent, visualization and quick response 
decision platform for urban planning, construction, 
management, disaster prevention and reduction.  
? A geological data publishing and sharing platform for 
the enterprises and public.  
? A comprehensive research platform for professional 
geologists. 
III. THE ARCHITECTURE OF GSSSMR 
GSSSMR is to build a “One Urban Geological Map” 
platform, in which all the diverse urban geological data can be 
displayed and analyzed in a unified virtual view regardless of 
their themes, data formats and storage positions, etc. And in 
this platform, urban geological data can be transformed into 
urban geological information, and then urban geological 
knowledge, and finally the great value for urban development. 
The development of GSSSMR is a systematic engineering 
with the concern with hardware, software, talent, standards etc. 
There are six main parts in the architecture of GSSSMR (Fig. 
1). 
? Support system: Support system includes the 
infrastructure of networks, hardware, support software 
(Operating System, databases, GIS, anti-virus 
software), etc. 
? Guarantee system: This system, the guarantee 
condition for the development and applications of 
GSSSMR, includes talent, coordinating department, 
system mechanism, standards, policies and rules, etc.  
? Technology system: This refers to some key 
technologies in the development of GSSSMR, such as 
data integration, massive data management, 3D 
geological modeling, information security, distributed 
technologies. 
? Mega-city Geological Data Center. For the geological 
data in mega-city regions have wide range source, 
several types, large volume, and complex 
relationships, it is necessary to establish the special 
geological data center, for the collection, integration, 
sharing and deep development of the basic 
geographical data, field survey data and dynamic 
monitoring data, etc.

Figure 1. System Framework of GSSSMR 
For there are many different applications and decision 
support subsystems in GSSSMR, it is necessary to 
extract the common functions in the various 
subsystems to build the basic support platform. And 
data management, geological thematic map 
production, 3D geological modeling and visualization, 
geological data processing and output, etc. are all 
included in this platform, based on the integration of 
the 2D GIS and 3D GIS. 
? Mega-city geological safety application systems. The 
application systems provide fast intelligent decision 
support and sharing services functions based on the 
basic platform, professional evaluation model and 3D 
geological models. What’s more, for the wide 
applications, the application systems can be divided 
into several thematic subsystems, for example 
significant engineering project geological safety 
system. And comprehensive analysis system can be 
conducted based on these thematic subsystems. In 
addition, different sharing services are provided for 
enterprises, institutes and public with the concern of 
information access right. 
The construction of GSSSMR is a huge systematic 
engineering, overall and step-by-step plans are all needed.  
A. Mega-city Geological Data Center 
Due to the geological complexity and multiplicity of the 
mega-city regions, the investigation content includes many 
subjects such as hydrogeology, engineering geology, 
geochemistry, geological disasters, stratigraphy, and 
geomorphology, etc. And the investigation methods include 
geology, drilling, geophysical exploration, geochemical 
exploration, remote sensing, test and computer, etc. In addition, 
the range of data includes ground, underground and 
aboveground. A special data center is needed for manage and 
analyze these complex big data, which is the data base for 
GSSSMR. What’s more, it is necessary to make standard and 
divide these data into basic geographic data, field investigation 
data, dynamic monitoring data, result data and metadata in 
order to manage them effectively. 
Mega-city geological data have obvious thematic 
classification and subordinate relationships, and can be divided 
into spatial data and property data. Spatial data are used for 
describing the location, geometry and topologic relationships 
of geological objects and phenomena, while property data are 
used for describing the quality or character of geological 
objects and phenomena. For the long geological processes, 
geological objects and phenomena have complex shape and 
spatial relationships. Property data, important results from the 
tough filed investigation and laboratory tests, have the same 
significance with spatial data. Urban geological data are 
obviously different from geographic data for the complicated 
relationships between spatial data and the existence of massive 
property data. Integrated storage and management of spatial 
data and property data can be achieved by the object oriented 
method, in which the association relationships are established 
by defining the primary key fields [5, 6]. In addition, it’s better 
to develop a data access middleware between mega-city 
geological databases and software. This can provide users with 
a transparent data access mode, in which they needn’t care 
about the data location, storage modes and data structures, etc.  
3D geological models data also need to be stored into 
databases. However, at present, databases which support 3D 
spatial data, especially 3D geological model data, are quite 
limited, and specific data structure and data engine are needed 
to be developed [5, 6]. 3D spatial data organization and spatial 
index should also be fully considered [5, 6]. 
B. Mega-city Geological Safety Supporting Basic Platform  
Mega-city geological safety supporting basic platform 
provides the basic software functions for GSSSMR. It includes 
the following modules. 
? Data acquisition and collection: All the acquired and 
collected urban geological data can be classified, 
arranged and collected in digital way and standardized. 
Data importation and transformation functions are 
also included in this module. 
? Data storage and management: It provides a unified 
software environment for the editing, centralized 
management, and search for different kinds of data, 
such as, maps, tables, and documents. Timely, 
accurate and dynamic data updating is assured in this 
module. 
? Thematic map compilation: Thematic maps, such as 
cross-sections, stratum histograms, isoline maps, 
statistical charts, can be created, edited and outputted 
conveniently. 
? 3D modeling and analysis: This module provides 
quick construction, convenient editing and clear 
visualization of 3D urban geological models in a 3D 
scene. And the common spatial analyzing, assessing 
and assistant decision-making tools, such as model 
splitting from any position, directions and angles, 
excavation simulation, isoplane creating are all 
included. 
? Information publishing: It provides a unified internet 
portal for the sharing and online web services of urban 
geological data and information. 
? Platform maintenance: User management, authority 
management, operation monitoring and fault recovery, 
etc. are included in this module. 
Mega-city geological safety supporting basic platform can 
be developed based on the integration of 2D GIS and 3D GIS, 
with the consideration of table processing, virtual reality, 
information security technologies etc. There are strong spatial 
correlations in mega-city geological data. GIS is suitable for 
organizing, managing and visualizing these massive, multi-
 thematic and dynamic data, and provides strong spatial 
analyzing functions with the saved topological relationships. 
2D GIS widely applied in many fields has relatively strong 
versatility, while 3D GIS is not so common and is 
independently used in different fields for the complicated 3D 
data models, building methods and analysis. Therefore, the 
integration of 2D GIS and 3D GIS is one available choice in 
the development of urban geological information management 
and service basic platform. In addition, to conform to the habits 
of geologists, graphical guide interface will be used when the 
related data and system functions are accessed. 
C. Mega-city Geological Safety Supporting Application 
Systems 
The application systems, which include professional 
analysis and assessment models, 3D geological models and 
application subsystems, are based on the basic platform. It is 
also a software system that can provide information sharing 
and decision-making assistance for governments.  
1) Professional analysis and assessment models 
One important objective of GSSSMR is to provide 
geological evidence for assessing the urban comprehensive 
bearing capacity of resources and environment. This can be 
achieved by analyzing and mining the investigation data and 
their characteristics, creating the assessment factors system, 
choosing quantitative or semi-quantitative assessment methods, 
and assessing the geological resources safeguard and 
geological environment quality with cutting-edge technologies 
and systematic knowledge. 
These analysis’ and assessment models include the models 
for geological hazard risk assessment, underground space 
development and utilization, groundwater environmental 
quality assessment, surface water environmental quality 
assessment, soil environmental quality assessment, land 
suitability evaluation, geothermal resource assessment, and the 
comprehensive assessment of mega-city geological 
environment and urban ecological environment, etc. At the 
same time, the dynamic monitoring models of groundwater, 
land subsidence, active fault and landslide, etc. should also be 
included for the mega-city resource and environment safety 
assessment and warming. 
All these models could be effectively stored and managed 
by creating a mega-city geological analysis and assessment 
model database, in which the modes can be conveniently 
modified and updated. Furthermore, third-party assessment 
software interfaces should also be provided in the system for 
the better opening.  
2) 3D mega-city geological models 
3D mega-city geological models, including 3D geological 
structure models, 3D geological property models, 3D 
underground buildings and structures, DOM (Digital 
Orthophoto Map) and DEM (Digital Elevation Model), etc., are 
used for describing the terrain, underground geological stratum 
and structures, human engineering activities in urban areas. 
These models can give a clear and integrated 3D display of 
aboveground and underground natural and man-made objects, 
and reduce the blindness in geological cognition and the risk in 
mega-city planning, design and construction.  
One of the important features and complexities of 
GSSSMR is to build links with mega-city 3D geological 
models such as 3D structural model of bedrock geology, 
Quaternary Geology, the 3D structure of the model, the 
engineering geological 3D structural model, 3D attribute model 
of engineering geology, hydrogeology 3D structural model, 
hydrogeological 3D attribute model. The further 3D 
visualization, spatial analysis and application needs to create a 
suitable geological model with appropriate precise. In addition, 
due to the complexity of the relationship of geometry and 
topology, uncertainty, and information incompleteness and 
complex processing algorithms features of geological data, 3D 
mega-city geological models is a bottleneck for the 
development and applications of the system [7-10]. During the 
construction of urban 3D geological model, researchers have to 
focus on multi-element data, multi-method integration and 
automatic-semi-automatic modeling, etc [11]. 
3) Multi-thematic application subsystems 
Based on the needs of mega-city geology safety, the related 
application subsystems is to be created, such as the subsystems 
for dynamic monitoring of geological hazards, major 
engineering geological safety assessment, underground space 
development and utilization, and comprehensive analysis of 
mega-city geology safety, etc. And the related application 
subsystems should be firstly constructed for solving the urgent 
problems facing in mega-city regions. 
D. Beijing Geological Safety Supporting System (Bgsss) 
As the rapid increase of the population (more than 20 
million now) and accumulation of varies functions in Beijing, 
there are many geological problems, such as groundwater 
resources shortage, land subsidence, dynamic faults, and 
groundwater pollution etc. The safety of geological resources 
and geological environment has increasingly become the 
bottleneck for the sustainable development of Beijing.  
Based on the shortage of energy and strategic resources and 
the active, hidden, unexpected and non-normal natural disasters, 
Beijing Geology and Mineral Exploration and Development 
Department provided the “two-engineering and one-system 
plan” in the Beijing "Eleventh Five-Year" geological 
exploration and development plan. In other words, they include 
the protection engineering of important strategic resources 
(land, groundwater, shallow geothermal energy and 
underground space resources), the urban geology security 
engineering, and BGSSS. And BGSSS is the core of Beijing 
Digital Urban Geology.  
Based on the Beijing 3D Geological Survey Project, the 
first stage project of BGSSS has achieved the construction of 
basic platform, including the functions of massive and multi-
 element geological data collection and management, thematic 
map compilation, 3D geological modeling and visualization, 
information publishing, and platform maintenance, etc. As with 
the professional analysis and assessment model, the monitoring 
of land subsidence, groundwater and shallow hypothermia, as 
well as groundwater flow model and simulation, have been 
initially achieved. There are 55,003 field investigation points, 
25,000 drill data and 200 thematic result maps in the 
constructed Beijing comprehensive geological database. 
Furthermore, 3D geological models of the bedrock strata, 
the Cenozoic strata and engineering construction layer in 
Beijing have been built based on the idea of "point - line - 
surface - solid", with a clear display of spatial structure and 
association relationships of different geological objects. An 
information hall with hundreds of square meters, equipped with 
3D visualization devices, was also put into use. The application 
of the system is shown in Fig. 2. And this system is the first 
one finished in the six pilot cities, and has also won the “Silver 
National Prize for Excellent GIS Projects in 2008”, awarded by 
China Association for Geographic Information System.  
In the first stage, the integrated mode of C/S and B/S was 
applied. Oracle was selected as the basic database. MapGIS 
was selected as the basic 2D GIS platform. GSIS developed by 
the Peking University research group was the basic 3D GIS 
platform. Communication between the 2D and 3D system was 
also implemented. 
In the second stage, the deep collection and integration of 
geological information resources in the institute of Beijing 
Geological Data Center with good updating mechanism will 
get to work. An integrated analysis subsystem of groundwater 
environment and land subsidence will be formed based on the 
groundwater environment monitoring net and the land 
subsidence monitoring net. The multi-disciplinary, cross-
 system and comprehensive analysis and decision-making 
assistance of urban geology will also be achieved. This phase 
of the project is going on smoothly. 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
Along with the increasingly rapid pace of urbanization in 
China, there occurs some mega-city regions with the cluster of 
talent, capital, technology and information. It becomes 
increasingly urgent for the intellectualized, integrated, multi-
 dimensional and quick-response mega-city geological safety 
supporting system in order to guarantee the geological 
resources and geological environment safety and sustainable 
development. However, it may be some difficult to develop 
such a system for that it involves several professional fields 
with complexity, high technical content, and a wide range of 
services. Based on the geological data and application 
characteristics, this paper analyzed the requirements of 
geological safety supporting system for mega-city regions, then 
designed the architecture of the system and carried out the 
construction of Beijing geological safety supporting system. 
This study can be helpful for other mega-city regions for 
different mega-cities may have many common needs for the 
system construction. In addition, this study may also be 
referenced for the system construction in the other scale cities.
