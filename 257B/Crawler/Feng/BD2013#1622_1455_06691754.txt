Abstract— Fetal biometry is considered the keystone in fetal 
well-being assessment. In particular, fetal growth curves built by 
means of ultrasound images and reference charts (defining the 
normal and pathological sizes for each biometric parameter and 
for each gestational age) are extensively adopted to track fetal 
sizes from the early phases of pregnancy up to delivery. In 
literature a large variety of reference charts are reported to 
consider the differences among different ethnic groups, but they 
are up to five decades old and they do not consider 
environmental factors such as foods, lifestyle, smoke, familial 
aspects, physiological and pathological variables, temporal 
parameters etc., which cannot be disregarded in a correct 
diagnosis. Therefore, current reference charts are rapidly 
becoming inadequate to support the melting pot of ethnic groups 
and lifestyles of our society, while customized reference charts 
can provide an accurate fetal assessment for the different fetal 
anthropometrical variables. Starting from a detailed analysis of 
the limits of classical reference charts, the paper presents a new 
method, based on multidimensional analysis for creating 
personalized fetal growth curves. A simple implementation, 
based on Open Source software and simulated data, shows the 
need of Big Data techniques in order to scale up the problem. 
Keywords—Cloud computing; fetal growth; personalized 
diagnosis; multidimensional analysis. 
I.  INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 
In obstetrics and gynecology, data coming for medical 
tests are often used for diagnostic and documentation 
purposes, opening the stage for a systematic data analysis to 
improve patient care and to develop new health-assessment 
techniques. 
For example, throughout pregnancy ultrasound scans of 
the maternal abdomen are routinely used to track fetal growth 
and to assess fetal health. This is pursued by collecting fetal 
parameters such as Biparietal Diameter (BPD), Head 
Circumference (HC), Abdominal Circumference (AC), Femur 
Length (FL), Crown to Rump Length (CRL). To detect 
whether growth parameters lay within normal ranges, 
measured values are compared to statistical data (i.e. reference 
charts with fetal growth curves, showing average values of 
such parameters as a function of the gestational age). 
Abnormal fetal growth parameters often are indicators of 
potential fetal pathologies. 
The importance of this test, proposed by Lubchenco [11], 
Usher and McLean [21] and Babson and Brenda [1] more than 
five decade ago is supported by a huge amount of scientific 
literature and by the clinical evidence, but the same literature 
clearly shows its main constraints: 
• the number of patients considered in the studies (some 
thousandth) is low with respect to the total number of 
newborn per year (about 140 ML in 2012) in the World; 
• the patients considered in the studies are not representative 
of the variety of anthropometrical factors related to 
ethnicity, to familial aspects and to other relevant internal 
and external factors; 
• the commonly used growth curves are up to five decades 
years old, they are not updated for the current population 
and they are not suitable to investigate temporal trends 
and dynamic aspects in fetal growth curves. 
Indeed, fetal growth is influenced by a variety of factors, 
racial, social and economic among others, as well as specific 
medic conditions that may pre-exist or that may develop 
during pregnancy. Hence, it’s not surprising that fetal 
biometric parameters show a degree of variation from country 
to country and from area to area within the same country. 
Beyond ethnicity, others factors affect fetal growth including 
fetus gender, physiological and pathological variables, 
maternal height and weight, drug or tobacco exposure, genetic 
syndromes, congenital anomalies and placental failure ([8], 
[15], [16], [20]). 
Some authors addressed these problems providing an 
increasing number of fetal growth charts for specific groups 
and subgroups of population, but their studies suffer from a 
considerable methodological heterogeneity making them 
difficult to extend them on the large scale. 
Other authors, such as Gardosi [4] in 1992, proposed to 
adjust growth curves for most of the influential factors and 
introduced the idea of individualized fetal growth charts 
according to specific maternal and fetal characteristics. After 
about 20 years the interesting proposal, based on proprietary 
software and on a centralized application, did not produce 
results documented in the scientific literature. 
From a theoretical point of view the creation of 
personalized reference charts for fetal growth curves can be 
formulated as a multidimensional analysis problem on the 
biometric dataset, routinely collected by doctors for fetal 
health assessment during pregnancy. Parameters (ethnicity,

maternal sizes, familial aspects etc.) impacting the fetal 
growth can be modeled as cubes dimensions and each 
homogeneous group of patients (with respect to a given set of 
dimensions) can be considered as a subcube of the above 
mentioned biometric dataset. In the multidimensional analysis 
the requirement of personalized chart can be also expressed in 
the form: “which is the normal range associated to the X 
biometric parameter of a Y-weeks old fetus belonging to the 
subcube defined by the Z dimensional parameters?”. 
An important constraint, in order to design a system able to 
dynamically answer to these questions, comes from the 
problem size, which is a function of the number of newborns 
per year. In this case, considering the storage space needed for 
the biometric dataset and for the other related data (order of 
magnitude of some PB), the distributed nature of the system 
and the number of operations per newborn (order of 
magnitude of millions or more) we will demonstrate that Big 
Data techniques  must be adopted to satisfy its requirements. 
The paper is organized as follows: after the presentation of 
the background and of the problem (Section II and III), we 
will show how a conventional open source data warehouse 
(DW) system can be effectively used to compute the 
personalized fetal growth curves (Section IV). Then, we will 
show why DW systems are insufficient to effectively manage 
the whole dataset needed to supply the “Personalized Fetal 
Growth Curves” service on global scale, and how the problem 
can be overcome using Big Data techniques (Section V). 
Section VI is for conclusions and future works. 
II. BACKGROUND 
After the pioneering works of Lubchenco [11], Usher and 
McLean [21] and Babson and Brenda [1], more than five 
decades ago, fetal growth assessment is a well established and 
mature research field in obstetrics and gynecology ([2], [3], 
[5], [6]). 
The proliferation of studies on specific subgroups of 
patients ([23], [24], [25], [26], [27]) and the related proposals 
of an ever increasing number of reference charts was 
characterized by a considerable methodological heterogeneity 
making difficult to normalize them and generally reuse for 
diagnostic purposes. As a consequence in clinical practice 
generic reference charts are preferred to specific ones, or to 
more complex approaches based on suitable mathematic 
models [26], because of their simplicity. 
To preserve the simplicity of the approach without loss of 
diagnostic power, some authors proposed the adoption of 
purposely developed software tools (Web Applications, 
Mobile Application, …) to create customized growth charts 
([4], [5], [9]) based on a regression model fitted to a very large 
group of newborns. GROW software [9] by Gardosi can be 
used as a web application or stand alone. Once inserted 
parameters such as weight, height, gender and ethnicity, it 
produces an ideal fetal growth curves using the GROW 
(Gestation Related Optimal Weight) method. Another widely 
used software is EcoPlus by Thesis Imaging1, an information 
system which allows comprehensive management of medical

records by typing fetal biometric parameters, which are 
directly compared with the reference values for gestational 
age, with the display of the growth curve percentile. 
X-Report OstGyn2 processes ultrasound parameters in real 
time, displaying graphics of the acquired data, and comparing 
them with those of previous scans. The software offers the 
possibility of adopting different references for the growth 
curves.  
Since the reference values are often based on tables and 
formulas not easy-to-interpret, patients are increasingly 
making use of web applications or even mobile applications 
(Apps) preferring the simplicity and immediacy of reading 
rather than the scientific and methodological correctness. 
Among the best known applications there are iFetus3 uses the 
most recent and updated biometric tables of the Caucasian 
race (valid for both European and North American 
populations); Fetal Ultrasound Calculator24 and Percentile 
Growth Charts5 that let patient know the percentiles based on 
World Health Organization (WHO) standards and to design 
custom charts. 
These applications address the problem of positioning data 
on chart used as reference standard for the construction of 
growth curves, but WHO standards are dated, they are still 
based on generic reference charts and don’t differentiate by 
ethnic origin, so they are unsuitable to assess the biometric 
parameters in several cases of practical interest. 
Despite the widespread adoption of cloud-based solutions 
by most industries, cloud computing has been slowly 
embraced by healthcare and the biggest impeding factors are 
concerns about security and performance of cloud services 
causing their low rate usage (this is the official reason for the 
closure of Google Health and Revolution Health for example) 
and the skepticism of institutions. Despite all oppositions, 
several institutions have moved to cloud infrastructure to 
lower their storage costs and facilitate the exchange of images 
and medical record. Examples are Microsoft Health Vault 
[14], the Merge Healthcare’s Project Honeycomb [13] and the 
Accenture Medical Imaging Solution [22]. 
To our knowledge big data techniques for approaching the 
problem of personalized growth chart are still not explored, 
even if it is clear that potential benefits can come.  
Some authors have already proved the benefits of some 
techniques in dealing with large volumes of data ([28]). In the 
following of the paper we will disclose these reasons. 
III. THE USE OF MULTIDIMENSIONAL MODELLING FOR 
PRODUCING PERSONALIZED CHARTS 
The detailed analysis of the fetal intrauterine growth 
monitoring is out of the scope of this paper but, in summary, 
the underlying idea is that:

- fetuses at the same gestational age, with similar genetic 
make-up (ethnicity, familial aspects, ...) and in similar 
environmental conditions (food, smoke, drugs, ...) are 
subject to similar growth curves. This kind of fetuses will 
be referred, in the following of the paper, as 
Homogeneous Fetal Groups (HFG); 
- a fetus with growth parameters different from those of its 
HFG is potentially pathologic. 
 
Figure 1: Fetal-Infant Growth Chart as presented by Fenton TR 
in Pediatrics, 2003 Dec 16; 3(1) 
 
Monitoring is performed by measuring the length or the 
circumference of specific parts of the fetal skeleton (the above 
cited BPD, HC, AC, FL and CRL) by means of maternal 
trans-abdominal ultrasound pictures (Figure 1). For the 
purposes of this paper, for each given HFG at each gestational 
age (in weeks) the probability to find a given length can be 
approximated by a Gaussian distribution. This is justified by 
the natural anthropometric variability we can observe in 
normal fetuses and by the errors associated to the 
measurement procedure. 
For diagnostic purposes we assume that fetuses are healthy 
if their sizes are between the 10th and the 90th percentile of 
the cumulative distribution function. They are pathologic if 
their sizes are out of the interval 3rd – 97th., otherwise they 
are borderline. 
 
Figure 2: Gaussian curve generated with 100 samples, given a 
predefined parameter (head circumference) and a fixed 
gestational age 
The Gaussian curves are effective for diagnosis purposes if 
their variance is small and the Gaussian bell is strict around 
the average. It is evident that if the sample for calculating the 
curve is small it is not representative of the whole population, 
while if they sample is too large it can present considerable 
anthropometric variability, which will be represented with a 
wide variance, and the corresponding Gaussian curve will be 
little effective for diagnostic purposes. 
Therefore the right statistic sample with the smallest 
possible variance is the HGF we can obtain with the largest 
sample of patients. Moreover, it’s easy to see that all HGFs 
can be dynamically extracted from the whole dataset by means 
of multidimensional queries where fetal sizes are the measures 
[7], while the dimensions are the parameters (ethnicity, 
maternal weight and height, familial aspects, foods etc.) 
impacting the fetal growth. 
 
 
Figure 3: Dimensional fact model of an ultrasound monitoring 
visit 
As shown in Figure 3, in collaboration with a research 
group on obstetrics and gynecology we identified 9 main 
dimensions of analysis and 6 measures for the biometric fetal 
sizes. This lead to more than 10.000 Homogeneous Fetal 
Subgroups that the system must be able to identify and 
continuously update by adding the new fetal sizes when they

arrive from the hospitals or from the patients (20 ML per year, 
about 2 every 3 seconds). It means that this problem largely 
exceeds the computation capabilities of a classic 
multidimensional analysis system, such as the one included in 
the Pentaho suite. In order to produce updated HFG in a 
reasonable time, specific techniques must be investigated. For 
example Pentaho community has developed a specific project 
for high-performance, scalable and distributed memory 
clustering cache, called Community Distributed Cache (CDC). 
The project allows to clear the cache of only specific 
Mondrian cubes. This feature allows to update each single 
HFG without impacting on the other cubes. Another approach 
can explore advanced clustering techniques for 
multidimensional datasets based on MapReduce Framework, 
as in [28], which demonstrated the be very effective to solve 
the problem at a reasonable price by means of Big Data 
techniques running on cloud infrastructure. 
IV. DATA LAYER DESIGN 
For the purposes of this paper, fetal biometric data and 
maternal data are created by means of a simulator, but in a real 
scenario, for a fully functional system, we should consider that 
medical data comes from a number of heterogeneous sources 
(hospitals, EHR repositories, patients etc.) through different 
channels (web services, web applications, mobile applications 
etc.) in different format (HL7 or proprietary formats). 
 
Figure 4: Data model of Data4GO 
This aspect brings to design a data layer made up of a 
distributed data architecture (Figure 4) which hierarchically 
integrates transactional data coming from the sources and 
normalized against a shared reference model (DB4GO – 
DataBase for Gynecology and Obstetrics). The distributed 
DB4GO is transformed in the DW4GO, which is the 
repository for the multidimensional datamarts of HFG. 
 
A. The DB4GO layer 
For modeling the maternal and fetal data we started from 
the HL7 Reference Information Model [10] and from the 
Universal Data Model [18] which represents two good starting 
point in healthcare. Moreover, we analyzed the HL7 Common 
Data Model based on the Data Model Harmonization Process 
for the integration phase [10]. 
Two fragments of the adopted model, used to prepare data 
for the multidimensional analysis phase, are shown in Figure 5 
and Figure 6. The fragment in Figure 5 represents a model 
more suitable for the initial phase in which doctors collect all 
the data by means of anamnesis interviews. The fragment in 
Figure 6 represents a part of the Entity-Relationship diagram 
used for the multidimensional analysis phase. 
 
Figure 5: A fragment of the ER patient-oriented diagram 
 
Figure 6: A fragment of the ER report-oriented diagram 
 
B. DB4GO data partitioning 
The partitioning is due to the fact that each country is 
regulated by specific laws on health data management 
(privacy, security, accountability etc.) so that the granularity 
of data sources cannot be greater than that of the countries 
involved in the experiment. In general we can expect e much 
lower granularity, from the hospital size to the single user (via 
web application or mobile) size. Moreover, in several 
countries data protection laws require knowledge of where 
data are stored. For example this limits the adoption of the 
cloud in countries like Spain, France or Italy until cloud 
providers allowed obligatory data storage in a specific 
geographic location [12]. 
This aspect is important because, for further developments, 
we can imagine to exploit the distributed query capabilities 
typical of several modern clouds to index the ultrasound 
images and the other data and metadata produced for the fetal 
growth test and to retrieve it, according to specific criteria.

This has the potential to improve the diagnostic process 
included in the fetal growth test and to support the inductive 
statistic approach which is typical of Big Data research. 
C. Problem  size 
Each year 140 millions of newborn come to the World (4.4 
from US and 5.5 from Europe). Considering a Fetal Growth 
Tracking (FGT) online-service able to follow 50% of 
newborns from Europe and US, a record size of 10 KB for 
each pregnant woman plus 2 KB for each fetus and a running 
window of 6 year to track mothers with 2 or more children, the 
global storage space sum up to about 360 GB of online 
multidimensional data (and about 1.5 PB including also 
ultrasound images). 
From the computational point of view, to generate the 
custom growth charts, the FGT system should run about 20 
millions (5 millions pregnant women x 4 tests) 
multidimensional queries per year, i.e. about 2 queries each 3 
seconds, which largely exceed the capabilities of a standard 
business intelligence suite (normally adopted for 
multidimensional analysis) such as Pentaho. 
Existing Big Data solutions focus on addressing the 
Volume aspect of the 3-V’s of Big Data [29]. Specialized 
technologies including distributed databases [30], Hadoop [31] 
and NoSQL ([32], [19]) have been developed to support 
scalable data storage and on-demand querying over large 
volumes of data. These systems usually provide high read 
performance for data that has been persisted and properly 
indexed.  
V. TEST ARCHITECTURE 
To have a first indication about the resources consumed by 
the FGT service and about how they scale with the problem 
size we created two dataset representative of the Italian 
demographic population (60 million inhabitants, 21 main 
ethnic groups). The two datasets, including respectively, 
100.000 and 1.000.000 records, were produced by using the 
inverse Gaussian distribution function, generating respectively 
500 and 5.000 Homogeneous Fetal Groups. 
The 2 dataset were loaded on a Pentium 5 machine running 
at 2.5 GHz with 8 GB of RAM and 2 TB of storage space 
(SATA Disks). Then, they were processed with Pentaho 4.8 
Community Edition, running 500 random queries to generate 
500 different Personalized Fetal Growth Charts. The average 
elapsed times are shown in Fig. 3. They clearly demonstrate 
that even with a small fraction (about 3%) of the records to be 
processed in the fully working system, a single machine is far 
from satisfying the temporal constraints of processing 2 
queries each 3 seconds defined in the previous section. 
As a second option we considered a recent evolution of the 
commercial version of Pentaho, called “Pentaho Business 
Analytics for Big Data”, which interfaces with Hadoop and 
other NoSQL and Analytic databases, permitting to create 
MapReduce functions and to visualize the results in Pentaho. 
 
Figure 7: Processing time with respect to the patients’number 
The detailed comparison between the results are shown in 
Figure 7 and they show a significant performance 
improvement, sufficient to meet the previously defined 
temporal constraint at a reasonable price. 
Two more options are under evaluations: 
- the adoption of a different processing strategy, based on 
the clustering of multidimensional dataset with Hadoop, 
as described in [28]; 
- the adoption of tensor-based computation, which is a very 
effective way to manage multidimensional datasets on 
distributed and parallel machines. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORKS 
The fetal growth assessment is a relevant problem since it 
concerns about 140 ML of newborns per year. Due to the 
population and “ethnicity reshufflement”, it’s by nature a 
global phenomena which can benefit from the adoption of Big 
data techniques and cloud infrastructures. The goal is to obtain 
personalized Fetal Growth Curves’ computation within a 
given timeframe (< 1.5 s) over a given dataset (about 360 GB) 
of multidimensional data. 
In order to have some preliminary figures about the 
resources consumed by FGT service we performed 2 different 
experiment based on Pentaho and Hadoop. 
The first results show that the problem can be solved at a 
reasonable cost and in an acceptable time. More promising 
results came from the adoption of 2 advanced approaches 
based parallel clustering algorithm and on tensor-based 
computation. 
In the future we plan to deeper explore these solutions 
comparing them with the Pentaho-Hadoop approach.
