 Abstract—The incredible growth of the internet use for all
 kinds of businesses has generated at the same time an increase
 of fraudulent activities, which calls for developing new methods
 and tools for detecting fraud and other crimes against banks
 and customers. Fraud detection needs to analyze and link
 data, which are gathered from heterogeneous data reposito-
 ries, and to address problem solving algorithms optimization
 and parallelization, new knowledge representation paradigms,
 association mechanisms for linking data, and graph analysis
 for clustering and partitioning. We present in this paper the
 motivation of our study and the first steps of the work. We
 will focus on the emergence of new coding models based on
 MapReduce and SQL extensions, and on graphs paths issues.

 clustering; parallel processing; fraud detection
 I. INTRODUCTION
 The incredible growth of the internet use for all sort of
 applications such as data production and storage, business
 transactions, professional, cultural and personal informa-
 tion management, etc. are pushing back the frontiers of
 traditional computer and digital data management. This
 overwhelming activity allows all kinds of players to propose
 new services and offers. Unfortunately, some did not hesitate
 to take advantage of this space to be engaged in fraudulent
 activities, such as Identity Theft Fraud. The objective of
 this study is to work on a new way to address large
 scale social network fraud detection by combining real-
 time processing and batch processing in data warehouse and
 Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS).
 Fraud is often characterized by irregular concentration of
 activities on subsets of nodes in subnetworks of the internet,
 particularly on online social networks (OSN). This calls for
 linking data, which were not likely to be linked, because they
 do not belong to the same networks. Linking social networks
 data, spread upon different heterogeneous data repositories,
 calls for addressing several challenging problems such as
 algorithms optimization and parallelization, new knowledge
 representation paradigms for heterogeneous, redundant, non-
 certified or false information, association mechanisms, graph
 analysis for clustering and partitioning.
 To address this multi-dimensional problem, we will adopt
 the following approach: 1) identify community subnetworks
 by using community detection algorithms running in a
 parallel environment, 2) represent data and knowledge stored
 in these networks in a common knowledge scheme, 3) apply
 iterative algorithms for clustering and partitioning.
 The paper is organized as follows. We present in the
 second section, some of the main characteristics of OSN
 data, specially in the case of fraudulent activity. Then,
 we describe some recent works in different areas such as
 community detection in social networks, the analysis of large
 graphs, the clustering and partitioning of bi-partite graph
 and fraud detection. Then we introduce the basis of our
 approach. In the third section, we present how we intend to
 develop our study, and how we are going to test the proposed
 solutions through experiments. In the last part, we will give
 some preliminary conclusions.
 II. SOCIAL MEDIA, SOCIAL NETWORK AND BIG DATA
 The volume of data recorded and exchanged on networks
 requires developing new management approaches for data
 storage, update, search, visualization and analysis. In addi-
 tion, these data are not stored in a unique digital format, but
 are heterogeneous, structured or not, and multimedia.
 In that project, we will focus more precisely on these
 networks formed by potentially linked data, due to the fact
 that they share the same fraudulent activity. The objective is
 to be able to give traits to theses nodes and links, to show
 how they are grouping, forming interest communities or even
 emerging structures. The links are built based on certain
 information exchanges between individuals, organisms or
 entities. There are communication links representing the
 messages exchanged between people , membership links
 representing structures (companies, social or professional
 groups, services, product categories, etc.) and association
 links between entities. A first distinction can be done at this
 level between static links representative of structures and
 dynamic links representative of actions.
 In the field of social network analysis many approaches
 are based on networks decomposition into subnetworks, such
 as in the case of community detection in social networks [1].
 An agglomerative technique allows identifying all maximal
 cliques representing relationships. The kernels of eligible
 communities are formed by iteratively adding the left ver-
 tices to their closest kernels to obtain a fractional community

that represent the fractional subnetwork.
 Bipartite graph partitioning and data clustering are par-
 ticularly promising approaches for graph analysis [2].
 The problem is formulated as a bi-partite graph to clus-
 ter/partition nodes by minimizing an edge density function
 using Singular Value Decomposition. A framework com-
 posed of model and MR functions that include several graph
 analysis functions can be used for large graph processing [3].
 Different types of fraud measurement and detection tech-
 niques have already been proposed, some of which are using
 community construction based on indirect links between
 individuals [4]–[6].
 For working on these massively distributed petabytes of
 social network data, we will use the Teradata Aster Data
 SQL/MapReduce framework that is a practical approach to
 self-describing, polymorphic, and parallelizable user defined
 functions. SQL MapReduce (SQL/MR) features enhance
 large data sets through parallelized execution and makes it
 possible to test the algorithm with massive volumes of data
 about users, devices, and activities. Thus, the exploration and
 investigation of data to identify relationships indicative of
 likely fraud becomes easier with custom MR functions using
 programing language such as Java, C or C++. SQL/MR
 allows the use of standard library data structures and open-
 source 3rd party libraries.
 III. RESEARCH PLAN
 In this work, we will focus on the emergence of new
 coding modes based on MapReduce and SQL extensions,
 and on graphs paths issues in the case of large scale networks
 architectures. We began studying alternative approaches such
 as the k-NN, and the conditions for finding convergence
 criteria in the case of recursive algorithms.
 A certain number of approaches and algorithms have
 allowed developing efficient indexation and information
 search functions. The HDFS file system linked to Hadoop
 allows to distribute the data storage and to run efficient data
 analyses thanks to the Map/Reduce model, which allows
 distributing one operation on several nodes in order to get
 parallelism for the execution. Model coding based on SQL
 combined with SQL Map-Reduce allows algorithms to run
 on parallel platforms linking several massive data sets i.e.
 structured data stored in a relational database combined with
 unstructured data stored on Hadoop systems. SQLMR also
 allows to implement iterative functions using SQL language
 and Java programming.
 The main steps of the research will be:
 • Select social network dataset or link several social
 networks data together (Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn,
 Google) by defining a large scale social network for
 analysis
 • Use an algorithm for determining community from
 the social network such as in [1]. We will develop
 extensions to this work and show the impact on the
 results based on the specific use case. We will com-
 pare these different approaches and re-combine the
 best into a new algorithm derived on k-partite graph
 clustering/partitioning algorithms that can be applied to
 such graphs. We will use these algorithms iteratively
 on parallel infrastructures like Hadoop according to
 convergence criteria.
 • Once a given community will be identified (with a
 known structure or not), we will apply different fraud
 detection algorithms on clusters/partitions to the iden-
 tified community matrix. We will focus in the first step
 of this study on Identity Theft Fraud detection.
 IV. CONCLUSION
 In this paper we have presented our motivations to study
 large scale social networks for characterizing communities.
 Our study will address the problems of linking informa-
 tion spread over several heterogeneous networks, algorithms
 parallelization and optimization for network analysis, and
 graph partitioning and clustering for structure extraction.
 We expect that this work will provide an answer to fraud
 detection
