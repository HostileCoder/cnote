Air Traffic Analysis
 ?Given descriptive pattern
 discovered using 
historical data, compute 
distinct air traffic within 
an air space volume of

 ?Boeing AATM has been receiving live Aircraft 
Situation Display to Industry (ASDI) data and 
archiving it for three years
 ?There is not an easy mechanism to perform basic 
analysis. The incoming data is large, compressed, 
and requires correlation with other flight data before 
it can be analyzed
 ?Boeing is implementing a service that records, 
retrieves, analyzes and visualizes aviation big data
 –Prototype work in progress
 Problem Statement
Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.
 ?Provided by the Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) to deliver flight plan and track information 
from the NAS to aviation industry in real-time and 
near real-time 
?Product of the Enhanced Traffic Management 
System (ETMS)
 ?A stream of data packets containing Zlib 
compressed XML documents with a binary header
 ?Can be flight plan related, oceanic, or host tracks

 Typical ASDI Data
Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.
 ?Each ASDI message does not always provide 
enough information to identify the flight it is 
associated with. 
?Centers operate independently of each other to 
assign their own Computer Identification (CID) 
code to flight plans. So, using CID alone is not 
sufficient.
 ?Correlator generates a new unique FLIGHT_KEY 
as it identifies a new unique flight plan. 
?FLIGHT_KEY is comprised of aircraft id, flight 
status, departure center, air craft type, destination, 
etc.
 ASDI Correlation

 Architecture 
?Data Warehouse approach implemented
 – IBM Infosphere Data Warehouse for data management
 – Backend DB2 database
 – IBM WebSphere Message Broker and MQ for near real-
 time ASDI feed consumption, message routing and 
transformation 
– SPSS Modeler for predictive analytics
 – IBM Cognos BI for front-end visualization

 Database Modeling
 ?Schemas for correlated ASDI messages translated 
into equivalent relational schemas
 – Database tables generated based on classes created 
from schema definitions 
– Nine main, eleven supporting tables
 – Each main table contains FLIGHT_KEY

 Database Modeling

 Correlation Process
 ?To archive received ASDI data
 –Track messages must be correlated with flight plan 
messages  
? FLIGHT_KEY assigned 
? Uncorrelated data tagged 
? Approx 30 minutes to correlate one day of data
Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.
 Historical Data Processing
 ?To load correlated data
 –Uncompress, unmarshall  
–Create a list of files containing the correlated data
 –Write data to warehouse
Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.
 Live Data Processing 
?Processed using IBM MQ, 
IBM Message Broker and a 
technique called XML 
Shredding 
?Message Broker Compute 
Nodes
 – Uncompress Node 
– Extract correlated messages 
– Shred Node adds to DB
 ? Stored Procedure “shreds” 
XML docs and adds to 
tables

 Issues and Observations 
?Initial load of one day of data ~ 7 hours
 ?Optimizations
 – Write data in batches 
– Use a mutable data structure to create data strings
 – Deploy a higher performance machine
 – Use load instead of insert 
– Use DB2 Range-Partitioned tables
 – Database tunings  
?Time reduced from 7 hours to approx 30 minutes
Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.
 Optimizations 
?Use a mutable data structure to create data strings
 – Original application created the SQL statement by 
appending elements to a Java String
 – It was taking five hours (of the seven hours) to create 
Strings
 – Instead Java StringBuilder used
 – Java Strings immutable
 – Time savings of 71.4%
Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.
 Optimizations 
?Deployed on a higher-performance machine
 – Application ported 
? from IBM Blade Center HS21 (4GB of RAM and 64-bit dual-core 
Xeon 5130 processor)
 ? to Dell M4500 computer (4GB of RAM and 64-bit of quad-core 
Intel Core i7 processor)
 – Reduced the time to thirty minutes
 ?Bulk loading instead of insert
 – Application was modified to write CSV files for each table
 – Entire day worth of data bulk loaded
 – Reduced the time to fifteen minutes
Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.
 Optimizations 
?Range-Partitioned tables (RPT) used
 – To limit the size of tables, the original code created 
multiple tables per table type
 – This puts burden on the application to query multiple 
tables when a range crosses several tables
 – With RPT, user is not required to make multiple queries 
when a range crosses a table boundary
 – Increased the time to thirty minutes
 – Additional fifteen minute cost per day of partitioning 
enabled time savings during queries
Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.
 Optimizations 
?Database tunings
 – Range periods changed from a week to a month
 – Automatic table space resizing changed from 32MB to 
512KB
 – Buffer pool size decreased
 – Decreased the time to twenty minutes
 ?Overall, total time savings of 95.2%

 Initial Analysis Activities
 ? Flights departing or arriving on a date.
 ? Flights departing or arriving within a date and time range.
 ? Flights between city pair A,B
 ? Flights between a list of city pairs
 ? Flights passing through a volume on a date. (sector, center, etc boundary)
 ? Flights passing through a volume within a date and time range
 ? Flights passing through an airspace volume in n-minute intervals
 ? All x-type aircraft departing or arriving on a date
 ? Flights departing or arriving on a date between city pair A,B
 ? Flights departing or arriving on a date between a list of city pairs
 ? Flights passing through a named fix, airway, center, or sector
 ? Filed Flight plans for any of the above
 ? Actual departure, arrival times and actual track reports for any of the above

Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.
 Predictive / Prescriptive Analytics Use-Case 
?For a given Airspace Volume of Interest (AVOI), 
compute distinct traffic volume at some point in the 
future
 – Aim to alert on congestion due to flow control areas or 
weather if certain thresholds are exceeded
 – Prescribe solution (if certain thresholds are exceeded)
 ? Propose alternate flight paths
 – Use pre-built predictive model
 – SPSS Modeler performs data processing
 ? Counts relevant records in the database (pattern discovery)
 ? Computes traffic volume using statistical models on descriptive pattern
 ? Returns prediction with likelihood

 Conclusion and Next Steps 
?Current archive is 50 billion records and growing 
– Approximately 34 million elements per day 
– ~1GB/day
 ?Sheer volume of raw surveillance data makes 
analytics process very difficult
 ?The raw data runs through a series of processes 
before it can be used for analytics
 ?Next Steps 
– Continue application of predictive and prescriptive 
analytics
 – Big data visualization

 Initial Approach 
?Initial Investigations 
– Apache Solr/Lucene
 – Data Warehouse
 ?Evaluate Hadoop in the future 
Copyright © 2009 Boeing. All rights reserved.
 Using SOLR 
?Uncompress Track Information Messages
 ?To use with Solr
 –Transforming track messages from their  original schema 
to Solr required building a “key, value” list using an XSTL
 – Queries made against this list of “key, value” pairs  
?Transformation Process
 –One day of data ~ 4.5 hours
 ?Once transformation complete search/query 
performance very good
 ?Geo spatial queries using  unique query language

 Representation  
?Aviation data is frequently represented in more 
than one form
