AbstractÑIn this paper, a new least square data fusion 
rule in multiple sensor distributed detection system is 
proposed. In the proposed approach, the central 
processor combines the sensors hard decisions through 
least squares criterion to make the global hard decision 
of the central processor. In contrast to the optimum 
Neyman-Pearson fusion, where the distributed detection 
system is optimized at the fusion center level or at the 
sensors level, but not simultaneously, the proposed 
approach achieves global optimization at both the fusion 
center and at the distributed sensors levels. This is done 
without knowing the error probabilities of each 
individual distributed sensor. Thus the proposed least 
squares fusion rule does not rely on any stability of the 
noise environment and of the sensors false alarm and 
detection probabilities. Therefore, the proposed least 
squares fusion rule is robust and achieves better  global 
performance. Furthermore, the proposed method can 
easily be applied to any number of sensors and any type 
of distributed observations. The performance of the 
proposed least squares fusion rule is evaluated and 
compared to the optimum Neyman-Pearson fusion rule. 
The results show that the performance of the proposed 
least squares fusion rule outperforms the performance of 
the Neyman-Pearson fusion rule.1

1. INTRODUCTION 
Multisensor distributed systems  have been receiving a lot of 
attention in recent years and now being employed in a wide 
variety of applications [1-11]. In distributed multiple sensor 
detection systems with data fusion, distributed multiple 
sensors monitor a common volume and send their local hard 
decisions to a data fusion center, which further combines 
them into a final global decision. The distributed sensors 
monitor the same object scene and transmit their information

about a hypothesis to the data fusion center. The data fusion 
center is responsible for combining the individual sensors 
decisions and making a final global decision about the same 
hypothesis. Such systems are expected to improve the 
system performance and be more reliable and immune to 
noise interference and electronic attack than a single sensor 
system [13-18].  
The optimum fusion rule under the assumptions that the a-
 priori probabilities are known, and each sensor uses the 
likelihood ratio test to arrive at its own local decision, is 
derived in [13, 14]. The optimum fusion rule for unknown a-
 priori probabilities in terms of the Neyman-Pearson test at 
the local sensors, as well as at the fusion center, is derived in 
[15, 16]. According to Neyman-Pearson strategy, the global 
detection probability is maximized for a desired global false 
alarm probability. In [14-17], it is shown that the globally 
optimal solution to the combining strategy that maximizes 
the global detection probability for a fixed global false alarm 
probability, when the distributed sensors transmit 
independent binary decisions to the fusion center, consists of 
likelihood ratio tests at all sensors and a Neyman-Pearson 
test at the fusion center. Unfortunately, the optimality in [14-
 17] does not always yield the global optimal solution. The 
reason for this is explained in [13, 16, 18-22]. The concept 
of quasi-convexity is addressed in [16] where it is shown 
that the optimality in [15] yields the optimal solution at the 
fusion center level but the global solution (at both the fusion 
center and the individual sensors) is not achieved. Since the 
global solution is computationally infeasible [3, 15-18], 
most publications assume the optimal solution only at the 
fusion center level, therefore there is a degradation in the 
performance. Performance analysis of distributed sensor 
systems, based on Neyman-Pearson criterion, is discussed in 
many publications [24-32]. 
The optimality of Neyman-Pearson fusion of statistically 
independent sensor decisions has been investigated in many 
previous literatures [14-19]. However, most of them require 
the knowledge of sensorsÕ reliabilities, i.e. the false alarm 
probability and the detection probability of each individual 
sensor, and assume strict stationarity of the noise 
environment. If the sensorsÕ reliabilities are not known, the 
fusion rule can not be implemented. Furthermore, if there is 
any fluctuation in the noise environment or any instability in 
the sensorsÕ thresholds, the system performance decreases 
dramatically [12-18]. In this paper, a non-parametric hard-
 decision fusion rule is proposed. It combines the sensorsÕ 
 2 
local decisions without the knowledge of the false alarm 
probabilities and the detection probabilities of the 
distributed sensors as in the Neyman-Pearson fusion rule. 
Moreover, it does not assume strict stationarity of the 
observed environment. It is a non-parametric and robust to 
variations of the environment under observation and of the 
sensorsÕ characteristics. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Problem formulation according to the Neyman-Pearson 
criterion is presented in Section 2.  The proposed least 
squares fusion rule is presented in Section 3. The  
performance of the proposed least squares fusion rule and 
comparison with the Neyman-Pearson fusion rule are 
presented in Section 4. Section 5 contains summary. 
2. PROBLEM FORMULATION  
We consider n  geographically distributed sensors with 
statistically independent observations nxxx ......,,, 21 , and 
have known probability distributions under both hypotheses; 
)|( 0HxP i and niHxP i ........,,2,1),|( 1 = . The two 
hypotheses are, 0H  (signal absent) and 1H  (signal present). 
The sensors local decisions { is 's} are combined in a central 
processor (fusion center) to derive a global decision 0s . The 
sensor observations are assumed to be statistically 
independent when conditioned to the hypotheses and no 
communication occurs between the local sensors. Because 
of these assumptions, the sensors local decisions { is 's} are 
also statistically independent. Each sensor i  quantizes its 
own observation ix  and makes a local decision. In case of 
binary decision, each sensor decision, is , may take the value 
0 or 1, depending on whether the sensor i  decide 0H or 
1H .  
 
Optimality criteria for the distributed detection systems in 
case of binary decision are known from previous studies 
[27-34]. According to the Neyman-Pearson criterion, it is 
required to maximize the global detection probability of the 
fusion center ( DP ) while keeping its global false alarm 
probability ( FAP ) below a given value, where 
 
)|1Pr( 00 HsFAP == ,                     (1) 
and 
.)|1Pr( 10 HsDP ==                       (2)  
 
When it is required to optimize the structure of the fusion 
rule only (i.e., for given sensors thresholds), quantization at 
the sensors should be performed on the likelihood ratio of 
the observations  [12, 24, 27]. The binary decision at each 
sensor can be described as

It is clear from (5) that optimum fusion rule requires the 
knowledge of fixed sensorsÕ false alarm probability and  
detection probability of each individual sensor; thus strict 
stationarity of the noise environment is required. 
 
When it is required to optimize the structures of both the 
sensors and the fusion center according to Neyman-Pearson 
criterion (which is called global optimization), the results 
are as follow [11, 18, 21-25, 32].

It is clear that the optimum decision strategies of the sensors 
in (13)  depend on }1,0,,...,1,{ == jniLij  which require the 
knowledge of the fusion strategy )(sD  as given in (12). On 
the other hand, the optimum fusion strategy as specified by 
(12) depends on the sensors thresholds. From the previous 
equations, it is clear that the global optimization is 
extremely difficult since the solution of global optimization 
conditions is not straightforward because it has implicit 
strongly coupled analytic forms.  
 
3. PROPOSED LEAST SQUARES FUSION RULE 
Assume that the central processor receives n  decisions from 
n sensors.  The central processor receives the reported 
sensors decisions nisi ,...,2,1, =  and it is required to derive 
a global decision 0s . Let s  be the vector containing all the 
sensors hard decisions, i.e. ]...,,,[ 21 nsss=s . The vector s  
is subject to two hypotheses 
 
,: 00 Nss += cH                           (15-a)   
.: 11 Nss += cH                             (15-b) 
[ 
where cs  is a vector whose elements are all equal to the 
correct decision and N is a random decision error vector 
under each hypothesis.  
  
Equation (15) can be rewritten as 
  
,1,0,: =+= cc ccH ??? Nss                          (16) 
where c?  is the correct decision designating the prevailing 
hypothesis, cs  is a vector whose elements are all equal to 
c?  (correct vector decision)  and c?N  is a random decision 
error vector with elements equal to zero or )21( c?? . From 
the vector s , the fusion center derives a single global 
decision 0s .  
 
Let U   be a )1( ?n  column vector of fusion coefficients 
with sum unity, ?  be a scalar value equal to 0 or 1, and F  
be a )1( ?n column vector of unity components, i.e.

Consider the following fusion equation system

From (16) and (21), (20) can be rewritten as 
 
.cc
 ??? ?=UN                                (22) 
 
If non of the sensors make decision errors, the vector 
c?N is 
a null vector. In this case, the fusion center is able to decide 
correctly the prevailing hypothesis 
c
 H? by selecting any 
vector U  satisfying (21) and determining ?  from (20). In 
case of regular detection; 0N ­
 c? , it is required to find a 
solution of the system equations (20) and (21), and to 
estimate ? . In other word, it is required to determine the 
vector U  which minimizing 2|||| ??Us  under the constraint 
(21). By performing the minimization twice, each time 
assuming a different hypothesis ? , the fusion center will 
adopt the hypothesis corresponding to the smaller sum of 
squares, i.e. the hypothesis better fitting the column vector 
s . In this case, the fusion center will estimate the hypothesis 
( 0ö? ) as follows:

It is clear that when s  is a null vector, the global decision of 
the fusion center will be 0H  and when s  is a vector of 
elements 1, the global decision of the fusion center will be 
1H . The global decision in these two special cases is 
independent of the true hypothesis, i.e. though this need not 
be a correct decision. 
 
Let us define the following function 
 
,)1(||||)( 2 ?+?= UFUsU Tcf ??                (24) 
 
where ?  is a Lagrange multiplier. Equation (24) can be

Since the objective function 2|||| c??Us  is convex and the 
equality constraint (20) is linear, it can easily be proved that 
the function in (25) is convex [33, 34].  To minimize the 
function )(Uf  in (24) with respect to U , we equate

Figures 1-4 compare the global detection probability of the 
fusion center (DP) versus SNR  using the Neyman-Pearson 
fusion rule and the proposed least squares fusion rule for 
different number of identical sensors n and global false 
alarm probability of the fusion center (FAP) assuming 
Rayleigh distributed observations. Fig.1 compares the global 
performance in case of n = 3 and 2.0=FAP , Fig.2 
compares the global performance in case of n = 4 and 
1.0=FAP , Fig.3 compares the global performance in case 
 5 
of n = 6 and 08.0=FAP , and Fig.4 compares the global 
performance in case of n = 8 and 06.0=FAP . It is clear 
from Figures 1-4 that the proposed least squares fusion rule  
has better performance than the Neyman-Pearson fusion rule 
for all considered situations.   
 
Figures 5-10 compare the LSFR and the NPFR in case of 
very small values of FAP s for different number of identical 
sensors n assuming Rayleigh distributed observations. Fig.5 
compares the global performance in case of n = 4 and 
05.0=FAP , Fig.6 compares the global performance in case 
of n = 6 and 01.0=FAP , Fig.7 compares the global 
performance in case of n = 8 and 310?=FAP , Fig.8 
compares the global performance in case of n = 10 and 
410?=FAP , Fig.9 compares the global performance in case 
of n = 13 and 510?=FAP , and Fig.10 compares the global 
performance in case of n = 15 and 610?=FAP . From 
Figures 5-10, it is clear that the proposed least squares 
fusion rule  is very accurate even in case of very small 
global false alarm probabilities. It can easily be extended to 
any number of sensors. 
 
The superiority of the proposed least squares fusion rule  
over the Neyman-Pearson fusion rule is obvious for all 
examples of Figures 1-10. It is clear from Figures 1-10 that 
the proposed least squares fusion rule outperforms the 
Neyman-Pearson fusion rule for the same number of sensors 
and the same global false alarm probability. It is worth 
noting that in most publications the Neyman-Pearson fusion 
rule is optimized either at the sensor level or at the fusion 
center level but not at both levels. When it is required to 
optimize the structures of both the sensors and the fusion 
center according to Neyman-Pearson criterion,  (which is 
called global optimization), the results are very complicated 
and the implementation is infeasible.

5. SUMMARY 
In this paper, a least squares fusion rule for multiple sensor 
distributed detection system with data fusion has been 
proposed. Unlike the Neyman-Pearson fusion rule in which 
it requires the knowledge of the error probabilities of each 
individual sensor and does not achieve the global 
optimization, the proposed least squares fusion rule 
combines the sensors decisions without the knowledge of  
the error probabilities of the distributed sensors to make the 
final global decision and also achieve better performance. 
than the Neyman-Pearson fusion rule. Hence it is non-
 parametric fusion rule. The proposed least squares fusion 
rule can easily be applied to any number of sensors and any 
type of distributed observations. It is very accurate even in 
case of very small global false alarm probability. The 
performance of the proposed least squares fusion rule is 
evaluated using Monte Carlo simulations and compared to 
the Neyman-Pearson fusion rule in case of Rayleigh 
distributed observations. Simulation results showed the 
superiority of the proposed least squares fusion rule over the 
Neyman-Pearson fusion rule for any number of sensor and 
any global false alarm probability.
