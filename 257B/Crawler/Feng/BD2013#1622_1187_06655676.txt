 Abstract—To address the current need of innovative technolo-
 gies that blend rapid data processing capabilities of computers
 with intuitive decision making skills of humans, we have devel-
 oped a prototype of Cloud Enabled Brain Computer Interface
 (CEB) decision making technologies. The implemented archi-
 tecture integrates cloud enabled big data analytics capabilities,
 networked BCI (Brain Computer Interface) devices, and Decision
 Making Engine. The novel CEB technology comprises of 1.
 Cloud-enabled BCI (Brain-Computer Interface) headsets, which
 is developed and networked in a cloud to enable rapid decision
 making and 2. Genetic algorithm based decision making engine,
 to intelligently assist the users in decision making; Advantage
 of our architecture is that when CEB loads the data, it will
 automatically recommend the best applicable Machine Learning
 (ML) algorithms after being evaluated to solve a given problem.
 Hence, with such automated machine learning techniques, CEB
 users workload is significantly reduced. Our experiments on
 DARPA dataset indicate that CEB technologies performed 10
 times faster and about 4 times less false negative rate than
 current computational methods in seeking and understanding
 information. Our results demonstrate that these CEB technolo-
 gies would enable humans to accurately and quickly detect
 meaningful information from a mass amount of data. The novel
 CEB technologies ensure that the reduced manpower does not
 result in reduced performance.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 Computers can process vast amounts of data in a short time
 but programming them to detect patterns is extremely difficult.
 Humans, on the other hand, are adept at extracting patterns
 from large amounts of data, yet are limited by the rate at
 which they can apply these cognitive abilities to large amounts
 of quickly changing information [1]. Consequently, computers
 have low success rates when tasked with detecting relevant
 and important information embedded in complex data streams,
 while humans are unable to effectively process large amounts
 of data that are fast becoming a hallmark of todays decision-
 making environments. Compounding the problem, traditional
 support technologies, like decision aids and visualization tools,
 create an artificial barrier which plays to either the strengths
 of computers or the strengths of their human operators, but
 not both.
 This problem could be addressed by imparting human intu-
 itive skills to the computers. Intuition is the process through
 which humans quickly make sense of partial, incomplete,
 or rapidly presented information. Intuitive decision-making
 processes are associated with rapid recognition of patterns
 among incoming streams of information followed by retrieval
 of associated knowledge without conscious attention [2]. The
 neural processes underlying intuition occur on a very rapid
 timescale and can be captured by non-invasive imaging tech-
 nologies. In parallel to the non-invasive imaging technologies
 discoveries, advances in bio-inspired adaptive data analysis
 techniques like genetic algorithmic modeling are now being
 used to filter and sort information that is presented to humans.
 To achieve this, first “hunches“, are generated around likely
 human responses. Then human behavioral responses are used
 to establish the plausibility of such hunches. Finally the refined
 information is being presented through multiple iterations of
 this process. Also it should be possible to augment the support
 of these bio-inspired data processing techniques by integrating
 into them with the neuro-cognitive measures of intuition.
 Combined with cognitive and behavior-based measures of intu-
 ition, neural measures should provide significant improvement
 in measurement accuracy [2]. This would enable humans to
 accurately and quickly detect meaningful information from a
 mass of data.
 In this paper we present the technologies for intuitive
 decision making to augment the current data processing tech-
 niques. This will enable humans to rapidly analyze large
 amounts of information in complex information environments.
 We have demonstrated that higher the amount of information
 processed per unit time, lesser is the overall decision-making
 time.
 In Section II, we have discussed the related work that is
 ongoing in this area. In Section III, we have explained our
 Cloud Enabled Brain Computer Interface Architecture (CEB-
 CIA) and the decision making engine. Section IV discusses
 our preliminary experimental results. In Section V, we present
 our conclusion and our future direction.
 II. RELATED WORK
 In recent years, a number of data mining algorithms and
 knowledge discovery technologies have been developed and
 applied for finding information from the ever-growing vari-
 ous data sources such as structured, unstructured, relational,
 temporal-geospatial datasets, etc., Hadoop [10] and Cloud Map
 Reduce [11] have been the leading parallel and distributed
 computing technologies that are used in wide variety of

applications and domains. However, these existing technolo-
 gies lack with respect to autonomic intelligent information
 processing operations across multiple modalities of the data
 [3] - [7].
 State-of-the-art MapReduce computing algorithm is imple-
 mented on parallel and distributed real time Hadoop or Storm
 [12] computing platform, which is used to support search
 engines, recommendation engines and big data analytics in
 wide variety of applications. However, Hadoop-MapReduce
 technologies alone are inadequate to perform autonomous data
 discovery and analysis operations across various data sources
 (e.g. Department of Defense Global Information Grid, Human
 Intelligence Collection, Open Source Intelligence Collection
 etc.) and data types (e.g. text, video, audio, images, etc.).
 This is due to the reason that they are incapable of seeking,
 understanding and presenting information and moreover both
 Map and Reduce functions are implemented on fixed nodes.
 Cloud computing technologies have been used for analyzing
 electroencephalograms (EEG) using neural networks [12]. The
 performance of the EEG processing on the cloud is much
 better than these most approaches using single EEG device-
 single user. For instance, 150 users use the cluster of 10
 machines; 1GB of EEG signals is processed every 83 seconds,
 and over 1TB of data is processed in a day [12]. However,
 current cloud approaches has the following limitations:
 1) They not designed to improve human decision making
 techniques.
 2) They need to speed up to process 1TB data in less than
 1 hour (over 24 times faster than current speed).
 Currently, the BCI technologies are in early experimental
 stage. Potential targets are identified by the BCI-human system
 based on the data fusion from the analyst0s brain responses and
 button clicks, when the images are presented to the analyst
 with a rate of around 3 to 10 images per second [3]. In order
 for the BCI technologies to solve real world problems, the
 following new capabilities are needed.
 1) Efficient computing infrastructures such as cloud com-
 puting, to enable real time analysis and big data analyt-
 ics.
 2) Mathematically and biologically precise models of hu-
 man brain functions, in order to capture and reuse human
 brain capabilities such as rapid decision making skills,
 learning, and reasoning.
 3) Better, reliable, economical and practical BCI devices in
 order to quickly and precisely capture and use human
 conscious mind, ideas, and neuro-cognitive measures via
 cross cortical waves and coherences, cognitive indica-
 tors, etc. for individuals and teams of humans.
 To address these limitations, our objective is to create a real
 time Big Data Analytics tools by synergistically integrating our
 innovative Intelligent Agents with real time Hadoop frame-
 work, streaming data processing tools, and proven machine
 learning algorithms (ML). We have utilized the open source
 Mahout, Rapid Miner, and Weka for the machine learning
 algorithms, and leveraged the proven source codes of our
 intelligent agents [8] and Blackboard pattern enabled agents
 [9].
 We also participated in the Department of Defense (DoD)
 Neuro-technology for Intelligence Analysts (NIA) program
 to accelerate Imagery Intelligence (IMINT) analysis [9]. The
 vision for DoD’s NIA program is to revolutionize how an-
 alysts handle intelligence imagery, increasing throughput of
 imagery to an analyst and overall accuracy of assessments.
 NIA seeks to identify robust brain signals that can be recorded
 in an operational environment and process these in real-time
 to select images that merit further review. Investigations of
 visual neuroscience mechanisms indicate that human brains
 are capable of responding visually much more quickly than
 they respond physically. Successful development of a neuro-
 biologically based image triage system can increase speed and
 accuracy of image analysis where the number of acquired
 images is expected to rise significantly.
 III. DISCUSSION OF THE ARCHITECTURE AND
 TECHNOLOGIES
 A. Cloud Enabled Brain Computer Interface Architecture
 Our CEB architecture consists of
 1) Wireless BCI headset devices,
 2) A novel cloud computing infrastructure capable of pro-
 cessing real-time data streams,
 3) A novel Decision Making Engine based on ML tech-
 nologies and
 4) Algorithm Selection Optimizer, to support a large num-
 ber of concurrent users.
 As shown in Figure 1, our Cloud Enabled Brain Computer
 Interface Architecture is designed by creating and integrat-
 ing cloud computing technologies, Brain Computer Interface
 (BCI) headset systems, and Decision Making Engine. By
 moving the analyses of BCI-human data to the cloud, our CEB
 architecture can avoid the limitations of existing mobile BCI
 applications. Instead of having a single computer dedicated
 to a single user, the CEB users can have a private cloud of
 clusters or computers serving many users. This approach has
 the following benefits over existing methods:
 1) By aggregating various datasets and users BCI headset
 signals, CEB users can have much larger datasets that
 can be used in the machine learning (ML) algorithm
 libraries.
 2) A CEB user can leverage a group of experts and multiple
 ML algorithms that are spread across a cloud. This
 would enable users to work together for a collective
 decision and thereby avoiding biases, human errors, or
 knowledge gaps of a single user.
 3) Through more complex analysis with the Cloud MapRe-
 duce paradigm, streams from the Electroencephalogra-
 phy (EEG) to the BCI headset devices can be analyzed
 over both immediate and longer intervals of data with
 respect to trends, patterns and knowledge sets.
 The protocol that an user need to comply with our CEB
 tools to solve a specific problem are as follows:
 61
Fig. 1. Cloud Enabled Brain Computer Interface -Human System Architec-
 ture
 Step 1 : CEB tools are automatically configured and cali-
 brated after the data and problem are entered into
 the tools;
 Step 2 : New users are trained to effectively apply the CEB
 system; CEB users can be trained anywhere and
 anytime via mobile devices (iPhones, etc.), wired and
 wireless computers.
 Step 3 : CEB technologies are used to speed up human
 decision making and automatically provide effective
 human machine interaction, rapid data-processing ca-
 pabilities, and information discovering, while facing
 big data sources and streaming datasets (such as BCI
 signals, etc.)
 Step 4 : CEB integrated cloud-enabled BCI headset systems
 and ML tools are improved by utilizing feedbacks
 from users.
 B. Cloud Enabled BCI Devices
 In order to make our CEB BCI headset devices to have
 the new capabilities, as indicated in Section 2, we have in-
 vestigated current existing Commercial Of The Shelf (COTS)
 and open source tools. We have developed the state-of-the
 art BCI technologies and devices as shown in Figure 2.
 To enhance CEB BCI devices, we have introduced human
 intuition measures (e.g., cognitive, behavioral, and neural
 markers) and neuro-cognitive measures such as emotional
 EEG, Electromyogram (EMG), Electro-Oculogram (EOG) and
 Electrocardiogram (ECG). This would further improve human
 real time decision making by use of brain-derived cognitive
 indicators and neuro-cognitive measures of intuition.
 Per our literature review, following are the benefits of using
 CEB cloud enabled BCI devices and technologies:
 1) Low cost, portability, wireless, ease of use, and many
 users using mobile devices and computers (wired and/or
 wireless networked commodity computers).
 2) Simplified process of executing experiments, anywhere,
 anytime, and virtually any number of users via wired or
 wireless networks.
 3) Real time data processing, expedited experimental de-
 sign, fast development and deployment processes, easy
 and quick training.
 4) Much better decision making due to the use of all users
 skills, expertise and knowledge via cloud-enabled BCI-
 EEG headset systems and machine learning technologies
 and
 5) Faster information throughput in processing large data
 sets by using cloud parallel computing and massive ML
 technologies via Mahout, SciPy, R, SAS and others.
 We have tested widely used COTS and open source EEG
 headsets including Emotiv EPOC headsets, NeuroSky Mind-
 Wave, MindSet, Mindflex, and XWave headsets [14, 16, 17]
 for the BCI performance. Using do-it-yourself tools like
 NeuroSky, developers can make the EEG headsets work with
 mobile phones. As per our survey, the Emotiv Epoc delivers
 far more accurate information, drive brainwave entrainment
 sessions, and adjust the frequency of a session to the most
 dominant brainwave within a set range instantly in real time.
 Candidate EEG headsets can be further developed into our
 cloud-enabled CEB BCI devices, which can be integrated with
 CEB Cloud Hadoop, Mahout and Storm.
 As indicated in Section 2, the current BCIs have many prob-
 lems such as exorbitant costs, inaccuracies, invasive surgeries
 and delays between thought, detection, and action. The Emotiv
 system can be improved as a cost-effective gateway to non-
 invasive portable EEG measurements. This would result in
 building a thought-based BCI system as shown in Figure 2,
 to measure human intuitions and decision making indicators.
 Our vision is that the CEB BCI will be a revolutionary new
 personal interface for human computer interaction, with a
 high resolution, capable of neuro-signal acquisition and the
 processing wireless neuro-headset, which could be weared
 directly without any conductive gels or liquids.
 Cognitiv suite monitors within Emotiv EEG System in-
 terpret the user’s conscious thoughts. Each brainwave EEG
 system primarily consists of a headset, electrodes and Soft-
 ware Development Kit (SDK). It can measure over 12 active
 thoughts including push, pull, lift, drop, disappear, and passive
 neutral state. The Emotiv Software detects these thoughts
 using built-in proprietary software. The Cognitiv suite distin-
 guishes the differences between four separate thoughts on-the-
 fly. However, the user can recognize additional thoughts con-
 currently by having multiple Control Panels open simultane-
 ously, each looking for different thoughts. Emotiv is currently
 considering enhancing the concurrent thought recognition limit
 to beyond four different thoughts. Emotiv offers Software De-
 velopment Kits (SDK), which grant various control to the user

 Technologies in the CEB System
 62
Fig. 3. An application case using the Emotiv tools
 over the EPOC headset API and detection libraries as shown
 in Figure 3. One of the research edition of the SDK, includes
 the Emotiv Control Panel, EmoComposer (an emulator for
 simulating EEG signals), EmoKey (a tool for mapping various
 events detected by the headset into keystrokes), the TestBench,
 and an upgraded Application Programming Interface (API).
 These features enable the capture of raw EEG data from each
 individual sensor. EEG data can be very noisy, which makes
 classifying it correspondingly difficult. However, Emotiv filters
 out frequencies between 50 and 60Hz in an attempt to improve
 the signal quality. A number of machine learning algorithms
 are built in Emotiv tool where the users can configure given
 parameters for their BCI experiments.
 The following are the key algorithms built in the Emotiv
 devices:
 1) K-nearest neighbor algorithm: The configurable param-
 eters of the k-nearest neighbor algorithm include a) K:
 the number of nearest neighbors used in the voting
 process; and b) WeightedVoting: a Boolean value which
 determines whether or not all votes are weighted by the
 voters Euclidian distance to the test example.
 2) Voted Perceptron algorithm: The configurable param-
 eters of the voted perceptron algorithm include: a)
 Epochs: the number of iterations performed over the
 training set; and b) Kernel: the kernel function used by
 the algorithm.
 These parameters such as K and Kernel will be automati-
 cally configured by our CEB BCI devices. CEB BCI headsets
 can be further developed to meet the users needs by (1) em-
 powering collective intelligence via our novel cloud computing
 infrastructure and (2) adding ML capabilities to quickly mine
 actionable information from big raw data sources. Our cloud
 enabled BCI devices are expected to increase the detection
 speed and accuracy precision in target detection compared to
 the existing approaches.
 The wireless BCI-EEG headsets can be applied to many
 areas. For instance, the following cases illustrate their practical
 usages or applications:
 Case 1: The idea of a directed selection of a desirable action
 or object can be motivated by internal likes, dislikes
 and preferences. Such internal processes are in the
 domain of our human physiology. Understanding the
 physiological processes of decision making across
 a variety of contexts is an essential aim in decision
 science. BCI devices have a great potential to further
 progress in the decision sciences research. The nature
 of decision making is explored by examining the
 associated brain activity, EEG signals of people to
 understand how the brain responds while undertaking
 choices designed to elicit the subjects preferences.
 Our networked wireless EEG devices can greatly
 help understand such human decision making pro-
 cess. CEB technologies can improve human decision
 making skills while dealing with time critical mili-
 tary or business mission tasks involving huge and
 complex data sets.
 Case 2: BCI-EEG headsets have become widely used in
 consumer BCI applications. Thus, these BCI devices
 allow one to conducting large-scale EEG experiments
 via Internet or Cloud. Experiments with Emotiv
 EPOC (EPOC) headsets have indicated that the clas-
 sification accuracy significantly exceeded the level
 of random classification. The control experiment
 has shown that utilization of high-quality research
 equipment can enhance classification accuracy (up
 to 68%) and that the accuracy is independent of the
 presence of EEG artifacts related to blinking and
 eye movement [15]. As against the more sophis-
 ticated multi-class common spatial patterns classi-
 fier, computationally-inexpensive Bayesian classifier
 based on covariance matrix analysis yields similar
 classification accuracy. CEB can test and select the
 best ones from many ML algorithms including Ma-
 hout libraries for the purpose of clustering, classifi-
 cation and collaborative filtering. The best ML algo-
 rithms can be applied to effectively solve problems
 in decision making and human training. Using CEB
 BCI headset devices, near real time flickers the users
 brain wave patterns can be detected, whenever the
 user is given a target feature. The target feature could
 be a hidden military facility, a tank and a vehicle in
 one of the briefly flashed images.
 Case 3: To develop high-throughput imagery triage applica-
 tion, a BCI system cortically blends computer visions
 with human robust recognition capabilities. The BCI
 system uses a noninvasive brain-computer interface,
 to intercept signatures of recognition events. The vi-
 sual processor performs perception and recognition,
 while the EEG interface detects the result or decision
 of that processing. The goal of the BCI headset
 system is to detect neural activity associated with
 perceptual and/or cognitive events. Detecting such
 events i.e., a physical target, a high value individual
 or soft target, implies the detection of when an
 event has occurred and identifying its significance.

Fig. 4. Cloud Computing and ML Modules Supporting BCI Devices in the
 CEB Technologies
 Recent advances in high-spatial density EEG, real-
 time signal processing, machine learning and human-
 computer interface have enabled these neuroscience
 findings to be used in the development of BCI
 systems. These advances in BCI systems have been
 proven effective to support high throughput image
 triage. The correlated spatio-temporal structures in
 videos could be identified similarly by humans with
 the improved BCI devices or headsets.
 Experimentation on several BCI devices have demonstrated
 that
 1) Use of human brain signals via the BCI headset systems
 can help analysts to increase the search throughput and
 support rapid target detection;
 2) Over six times increase in search throughput (Sq.
 KM/min) has been achieved across multiple image ana-
 lysts and target types; and
 3) Target detection rate at the rate of 5 to 10 targets per
 second of imagery chips has been reached by viewing
 rapid presentation of the stream images.
 C. CEB Cloud Computing Ecosystem
 We have developed the CEB approach to improve human
 information throughput and rapid decision making. Our CEB
 cloud computing ecosystem is illustrated in Figure 4. In our
 ecosystem, archived datasets from databases and file systems
 are processed by Hadoop and Map- Reduce. For instance,
 images or videos are read into the CEB and the images are
 presented to the analysts. Analysts can then select targets at
 the rate of 2 to 5 seconds per target and their BCI devices
 also send the mobile EEG signals into the CEB. The CEB
 can also detect targets of interest at much higher speed at the
 rate of about 1 target per100 milliseconds compared to human
 beings. Real time streaming datasets are being processed by
 Storm and Cloud MapReduce. For instance, live image and/or
 video streams from the satellite downlinks can be fed into the
 CEB system.
 To effectively process the real time streaming data sets,
 Storm is integrated in the CEB system as illustrated in Figures
 2, and 4. Storm is an open source distributed real time
 computation system [12]. In addition, Storm has many capabil-
 ities: real time analytics, online machine learning, continuous
 computation, distributed remote procedure calls, ETL, and
 more. Storm is also extremely fast with over a million Tuples
 processed per second per node. It is scalable, fault-tolerant,
 guarantees that the input data can be processed, and is easy
 to set up and operate.
 As shown in the Figure 4, data streams consist of many
 Tuples: Spouts read from Kestrel queue, streaming APIs,
 Web Logs, API calls and Event data; Bolts process these
 input streams and create new streams. Bolts provide functions,
 filters, aggregation, joins and database access. Topologies are
 networks or directed graphs of Spouts and Bolts. As shown
 in Figure 4, Storm cluster is integrated into the CEB system,
 which is composed of a master node and worker nodes. The
 master node runs a daemon Nimbus which is responsible for
 distributing code, assigning tasks, and checking for failures.
 Each worker node runs a daemon Supervisor which listens
 for work and starts and stops worker processes. Nimbus and
 Supervisor daemons are fail-fast and stateless, which makes
 them robust. Coordination between the daemons are handled
 by Apache ZooKeeper in the CEB cloud. A code segment
 of the CEB Storm is shown in Listing 1 to count streaming
 words.
 We have developed a novel cloud infrastructure architecture
 for big data analytics. We have leveraged and improved the
 cloud ecosystem using Mahout ML libraries and HBase. This
 enables the cloud based BCI-EEG devices smarter and faster.
 HBase in CEB provides a scalable, distributed database, that
 supports structured data storage for large tables. Rationale for
 utilizing HBase in CEB as it needs a random, real-time read
 and write access to process huge amount of data. HBase will
 be built in the CEB with the following technical components:
 a) Convenient base classes for backing Hadoop MapReduce
 jobs and functions with HBase tables. b) Query predicate
 push down via server side scan and get filters, that will select
 related data for track management systems.
 Listing.1. A Code Segment in Storm to Count words in
 a Data Stream

 Builder.setSpout(sentences, new RandomSentenceSpout(), 5);
 Builder.setBolt(split, new SplitSentence(), 8).shuffleGroup-
 ing(sentences);
 Builder.setBolt(count, new WordCount(), 12).fieldGroup-
 ing(split, new Field(word));
 ...
 Cloud Map Reduce cluster, Storm, and Mahout ML libraries
 used in the CEB will be much faster than using traditional
 technologies such as R package, because the former has been
 proven by their performance in varied applications [11-13, 5].
 64

 D. Innovative Decision Making Engine
 As shown in Figure 4, Algorithm Selection Optimizer
 is designed and developed to make CEB tools smarter and
 better. This is achieved by automatically selecting optimal
 algorithms for CEB users, after the data and tasks are entered
 into the CEB. Specifically, this Algorithm Selection Optimizer
 is based on our cognitive genetic algorithm and collective
 feedback and intelligence. Our cognitive genetic algorithm (its
 code segment is listed in Listing 2) in Algorithm Selection
 Optimizer is used to implement the collective feedback and
 intelligence. The following steps in Figure 5 explain how
 the cognitive genetic algorithm in the Decision Making
 Engine can help CEB users to improve their decision making
 speed and accuracy in effectively processing and analyzing
 ever-growing huge datasets and data streams.

 print();
 ...
 How to make optimal use of cognitive feedbacks in a
 computer-human system is one of the key problem areas
 that our work tries to solve. In a critical decision making
 process, two or more decision makers and their feedbacks,
 as shown in Figure 5 are required to ensure the objectives of
 decision process. In case of the huge data sources and fast data
 streams, cloud enabled CEB tools blend rapid data processing
 capabilities of the cloud with intuitive decision making skills
 of humans to improve human information throughput and
 decision making quality. Our CEB tools including Decision
 Making Engine enable the decision makers to have collective
 cognitive feedbacks and thinking through the wireless BCI
 devices and cloud computing power. Subjective errors, biases,
 and other decision mistakes of individual humans can be
 eliminated by such collective, collaborative and cloud enabled
 CEB systems.
 Technically, the Algorithm Selection Optimizer can use a
 knowledge base to manage what ML algorithms exist in the
 CEB, best solvable problems or tasks that the users provide,
 requirements on the input data such as data types and data
 quality. The following are examples of the CEB machine
 learning (ML) algorithms that can be applied to two areas:
 Classification: predicting a category, e.g., discrete, finite
 values with no ordering; Regression: predicting a numeric
 quantity, e.g., continuous, infinite values with ordering.
 These applicable areas (1) and (2) above can be solved
 by these 10 ML algorithms: Linear regression, Logistic re-
 gression, Linear and Logistic regression with regularization,
 Neural networks, Support Vector Machine, Naive Bayes, Near-
 est Neighbor, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient
 Boosted Trees. Importantly, this Algorithm Selection Opti-
 mizer can be automatically updated whenever a new algorithm
 is successfully applied to a known problem area (e.g., classi-
 fication, prediction, etc.). Therefore, the more ML algorithms
 CEB tools have, the more useful they become to solve new
 problems including various problems in rapid decision making
 in military and commercial applications.
 IV. EXPERIMENTATION AND RESULTS
 One of the key components in our CEB approach is the
 Blackboard patterns. We have designed and tested the Black-
 board patterns for opportunistic reasoning and associative
 memory. In our experiments, Blackboard pattern enabled in-
 telligent agents that have successfully identified the insurgents
 using the HUMINT and OSINT datasets [9]. These agents
 have successfully detected the high value individuals or soft
 targets by automatically searching, analyzing and quantifying
 the multi-INT data. Specifically, for one of the military use
 case, the intelligent agents has effectively identified the ad-
 versary leaders from groups of people based on the collected
 real-world data, and one screenshot is shown in Figure 6.
 Reusing the source code bases from our proven intelli-
 gent agents [8] and Blackboard pattern enabled agents [9],
 mobile CEB Agents were developed to automate tasks of
 seeking, understanding and presenting information. Their ma-
 chine learning capabilities were enabled by using open source
 Rapid Miner and open source Mahout and Weka for scalable
 and cloud computing environment. Mobility of CEB Agents
 Fig. 6. The insurgents are identified by our Blackboard pattern hosted agents
 65
were implemented as mobile Mappers and Reducers by using
 unanchored and/or mobile objects in socket programming and
 object serialization. Thus, machine learning algorithms em-
 powered by mobile Map Reduce functions were implemented
 in Hadoop clusters to enable advanced computational intel-
 ligence and scalable computing algorithms. Our preliminary
 experiments demonstrates that CEB technologies performs
 about 10 times faster and about 4 times less false negative
 rate and positive rate compared to current computational
 methods in seeking and understanding information. This is
 due to the following reasons: (a) Utilizing mobile MapReduce
 functions enables end-to-end parallelism of data processing
 and analytics; and (b) Using our mobile Agents based parallel
 analytics, CEB tools enhance data seeking (where and what),
 information understanding (analysis, association, reasoning,
 etc.) in parallel and intuitively present the actionable informa-
 tion to the users. Additionally, CEB Agents are also observed
 to have the following capabilities:
 1) Providing mobile scalable MapReduce analytics and
 ensuring execution results
 2) Performing the data fusion by summarizing the discov-
 ered information for the users
 3) Generating recommendations on multiple level of details
 for the users
 In order to speed up information discovery, we have built
 indexes such as inverted index, linking commonly searched
 frames to document IDs. These indexes are utilized by CEB
 Agents to construct links (file paths, web URLs, etc.) for
 original document retrieval and further data mining and fusion
 such as confidence ranking based observation summaries.
 After executing the Map functions, the mobile Agents execute
 the Reduce functions and cache most recent results for faster
 responses. When the current host has minimal computing
 resources, the Agents proactively construct Map Reduce func-
 tions and execute them in anticipation of large service requests.
 V. CONCLUSION
 Our CEB architecture and technologies will benefit gov-
 ernment, military, industrial, and business applications, where
 high quality decision making capabilities are required. We plan
 to further improve the CEB architecture, ML development and
 technology integration through the feedbacks from analysts,
 and trainees. Thus the CEB could benefit the user community
 by leveraging the advanced cloud computing technologies and
 the best human intuitive decision making skills across various
 fields. To demonstrate the feasibility of our innovative CEB
 approach, we are planning to conduct the future experiments
 to verify its feasibility, capabilities, and functionalities in
 improving human information throughput and rapid decision
 making. Performance assessment of the CEB prototype can be
 conducted to investigate by what extent the CEB technologies
 will greatly increase decision making speed and precision, as
 well as scalability for the applications it can support.
