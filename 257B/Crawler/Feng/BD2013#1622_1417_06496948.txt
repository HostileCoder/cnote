 Abstract— New SBAS (Satellite Based Augmentation System)
 signals could include the provision of new additional services
 alongside the defined SBAS L1/L5 aeronautical service [1], if
 additional power becomes available. In this paper we present
 a solution that efficiently makes use of the additional available
 power in order to increase the overall data rate of a new multi-
 service SBAS signal. These new SBAS signals will be backward
 compatible. The high power efficiency of the proposed scheme
 is guaranteed by a variation of the interplex scheme that is
 characterized by a variable envelope signal constellation. A
 coding scheme based on generalized low density parity check
 (LDPC) codes ensures that service requirements can be met with
 a lower SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio).

 1. INTRODUCTION
 The challenge posed by the design of new SBAS (Satellite
 Based Augmentation System) [1] signals is that the new
 signals must guarantee backward compatibility for legacy
 aeronautical users. Additional new multi-service SBAS sig-
 nals must provide higher data rates in order to incorporate
 additional services, e.g. maritime, precise point positioning
 (PPP), authentication, or alert messaging service. At the
 same time, they must be particularly power efficient, as the
 power available on a satellite is a limiting factor in satellite
 communications and navigation, where receivers have small
 antenna gains. Additionally, a sound design must also allow
 certain flexibility in the allocation of resources among the
 new services, in order to follow future market trends and user
 demands.
 The scheme we chose in this study to multiplex other ser-
 vices together with the SBAS L1/L5 aeronautical service
 is the interplex. The interplex is a multiplexing/mapping
 scheme that maps several signal components onto one carrier
 frequency [2]. Compared to other phase-shift-keyed/phase-
 modulated (PSK/PM) multichannel systems, the interplex
 is characterized by higher power efficiency, provided the
 number of signal components is not too large [2]. As other
 PSK/PM signals, the interplex signal possesses a constant

 envelope constellation. A constant envelope constellation is
 very helpful in minimizing the non-linear distortions caused
 by the High Power Amplifier (HPA). This allows to drive the
 HPA at saturation, where the power efficiency is maximal.
 Although a constant envelope signal suffers little of the non-
 linear distortion of the HPA, a constant envelope constellation
 has a price. This price comes in form of additional intermod-
 ulation (IM) products that are not used at the receiver, and
 thus they constitute a source of power inefficiency.
 In this work, the interplex scheme is modified such that the
 additional IM products are scaled and the signal constellation
 is not exactly constant envelope. The advantage of this
 scheme allows to adapt the interplex scheme by designing
 a signal that is tailored to the available HPA. Indeed, the
 amount of power invested in the IM products can be chosen in
 such a way to reduce the non-linear distortions caused by the
 HPA within reasonable margin and on the other hand without
 an excessively large IM power.
 The second element of novelty that we propose in this pa-
 per is an innovative coding scheme that encodes the signal
 components in a joint fashion by developing generalized low
 density parity check (LDPC) codes [3]. More specifically,
 we introduce a framework that allows jointly encoding and
 decoding the legacy signal, the main signal component, and
 the additional components while simultaneously keeping the
 legacy signal (aeronautical service) protected by the code
 defined for the baseline L1/L5 SBAS service [1]. In this work
 we present an example of such a coding scheme based on
 extended Hamming codes instead of convolutional codes as
 defined in [1].
 2. SIGNAL MODEL
 In this section we present the novel interplex scheme, we
 show how this technique efficiently can make use of the
 available power, and we describe the HPA model that is used
 in this study.
 Scalable interplex
 An  -channel interplex [2] signal is a PSK/PM signal

(DS-CDMA) signals, spread by Gold sequences [4]. We
 define the vectors:

 ponent.    is the processing gain of the DS-CDMA
 transmission. The signal components can be expressed as
 s  b  c    (4)

 vention of calling 	 primary or main component, since it

 are denoted by secondary components and are the additional
 components that are used to convey new services. The signal
 components are normalized in order to have unitary power,
 i.e. 	c	  , 
. In the following, the quantity  in(2) is chosen equal to  , as this suppresses the carrier and
 good part of the IM products [2]. Moreover, we assume that
 all secondary components have the same power, so   ,
  
  . In this paper we propose a modification of the
 interplex scheme (1) with a variable constellation. Since the
 focus of this work is the shaping of the signal constellation,
 we will not consider the state transitions, as we did in [5].
 This justifies our signal model (4) without pulse shape.
 The (baseband) signal constellation of an  -channel inter-
 plex can be written as:
 x   s   	 m	

 where m	 and m
 indicate the vectors containing the
 IM terms, which are introduced to make the instantaneous
 power of the interplex constellation constant (5). The vectors
 m	 and m
 have the same dimensions as s. In
 order to define m	 and m
, we introduce the following
 quantities:
 Z   : vector containing the sum of
 all Hadamard products denoted by

 tors, obtainable from all possible

 The scalable interplex is an interplex in which the IM terms

 In this paper we assume 	  
  . The scaling factor
  is a real number between 0 and 1. The IM power is given
 by the sum of the squares of all the terms present in m	
 and m
, if the spreading codes used to spread the signal
 components are Gold codes [4]. Indeed, if this is the case,
 the cross-products between IM terms is negligible, because
 the product between Gold codes is still a Gold code. The IM
 power is :
 	     	   (9)
 with  	   the IM power of the standard interplex
 scheme (5) which has the same value of  and . The
 percentages of the total power that are used for the primary
 and secondary component are respectively:

 with 	   indicating the percentage of power that is
 used for the IM product in a standard interplex scheme with
 the same value of  and . The term  	  
 accounts for the power that is recovered from the IM terms
 and it is equally divided among the useful signal components.
 Allocation of the additional power for the provision of new
 services
 The challenge of a signal design for the provision of addi-
 tional SBAS services is that the existing aeronautical ser-
 vice must be left untouched. In our model, the existing
 aeronautical SBAS L1/L5 service is provided by the primary
 component. The additional services will be delivered by the
 secondary components. New services can be incorporated
 only if additional power becomes available, since a band-
 width enlargement is not foreseen. We define the power
 increment as the amount of new available power with respect
 to the minimum power required by the legacy service:
  
 
 
 (12)
 2
The power of the primary and secondary components as a
 function of the power increment are
      
        (13)
 The power share among primary and secondary components
 is organized as follows. Initially, the additional power is allo-
 cated only to the secondary components, which for   (i.e. current SBAS signal), do not exist yet. As the power
 on the secondary components reaches the minimum power
 of the legacy service  , then the power is uniformly
 distributed among primary and secondary components. For
 each value of , there is a value of , which determines
 the above mentioned power partition, so (13) are dependent
 on  through . The dependency on  of (13) and on
  has been omitted in the following, in order to have a lighter
 notation.
 The SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio) also needs to include a
 margin, in case the satellite link suffers from any channel
 impairment while still achieving the target frame error rate
 (FER). The useful SNR is the received SNR, that takes into
 account this margin. The useful SNRs, that correspond to
 the above mentioned management of the power resource with
 (13), are:

 the Saleh model, known in the literature as modified Saleh
 model [7], [8, p. 113]. The AM-AM characteristic of the
 modified Saleh model that we use for our assessments is
  
 
  	 
 (16)
 where  and  are the input and output signal envelopes
 respectively, expressed in
 
 . With respect to the
 original Saleh model [6], this extended model allows to
 characterize the degree of the nonlinearity for which the HPA
 is responsible, through the parameter . In the classical model
   . In comparison to the formula in [7], we have ignored
 any scaling factor of the output as we are only interested in the
 distortion caused by the HPA. For the other exponents present
 in [7], we chose the values of the classical AM-AM Saleh
 model [6]. Moreover, since we are interested in a behavioral
 analysis, it is handy to write the input envelope as a function
 of the input saturation power:
   

    (17)
 The input envelope normalized to the saturation power is

 Since we are interested only in the distortion and not in the
 gain brought about by the HPA, we normalize the HPA output
 to the square root of the power of the input. The power of the
 input determines the working point of the HPA, indicated by
   
 
 
  (20)
 The AM-AM characteristic that we consider is such that the
 HPA does not alter the average signal power:
  

 
  	 
 (22)
 where  is in
 
  such that it always has the same
 power of the HPA input . This formulation allows to
 highlight only the power loss caused by the distortion, in-
 dependently from the HPA gain. We set the working point
 of the HPA, i.e. the average power of the input signal, at the
 input saturation power of the AM-AM characteristic:
   
 
 
 

 
    (23)
 This corresponds to an Input power Back-Off (IBO) equal
 to 0 dB. At this point of the AM-AM curve, both nonlinear
 distortions and HPA power efficiency are maximal. Fur-
 thermore, at this working point the PAPR (Peak-to-Average-
 Power Ratio) of the interplex constellation has the maximum
 impact on the power efficiency of the modulation.
 For simplicity, in our study we consider an ideal AM-PM
 curve. The AM-PM curve describes the phase noise that the
 HPA adds to the amplified signal. If the input signal has a
 constant envelope, the phase noise is a constant term and it
 creates no problem at receiver side. If the input signal has
 a high PAPR, the HPA output is affected by phase noise.
 A higher phase jitter reduces the power at the output of the
 receiver’s correlator and thus it is also a power inefficiency.
 Thus, strictly speaking, it would be necessary to compute the
 increase of the phase jitter of the received signal, for which
 the HPA is responsible, and then to derive the consequent
 correlation loss. Nevertheless, in this study we make the
 approximation that at the working point at which we operate
 the AM-PM curve is almost constant. If this is the case, the
 output phase has a limited dependency on the dynamic range
 of the input envelope, and the phase jitter caused by the HPA
 can be neglected. This assumption is in agreement with the
 study of [9], in which the AM-PM curve is almost constant
 when the input power is equal to the saturation power of the
 AM-AM curve.
 Scalable interplex performance
 In this section we asses the power efficiency of the scalable
 interplex scheme. The power inefficiencies can be of two
 kinds: correlation loss due to HPA distortions, and IM power
 loss. The output of the HPA is
 y  
 
 x
  (24)
 where x indicates the input signal, while   indicated
 the HPA transfer function described in (21). The signal y has
 the same power  as the signal x . The transmitted power
 is partitioned in 3 quotas:
     	 !
 ? ?? ?
 	
 		  (25)
 The term 	 is the one in (9). The power   is defined as
 the useful power at the correlator outputs at the receiver and
   is the useful transmit power. The correlator outputs for
 the primary and secondary components are respectively:
   

   
 
    y  c

 (26)
 where the symbol     ! indicates the scalar product
 between two vectors. The useful received power is
   
 

    (27)
 The power loss at receiver side because of HPA distortion is:
 !        (28)
 with
     	      (29)
 At this point we can define our metric, which is the total
 power inefficiency:
 " 
 ! 	 	
 
  (30)
 This quantity is a measure of how much transmitted power
 cannot be used at receiver side, either because of HPA distor-
 tions, or because it was employed in the construction of the
 IM terms.
 We evaluate the metric (30) for two HPAs: one with   
 (classical Saleh model) and another with   . The former
 HPA is taken as an example of a typical HPA, and the latter as
 an example of highly non-linear HPA. Both HPAs are driven
 at saturation. We performed this evaluation for   .
 The results are depicted in Figure 3 and Figure 4. In these
 figures the total power inefficiency of the scalable interplex is
 compared to the case in which no IM products are transmitted
 (  ). This latter case is a special case of the scalable inter-
 plex that coincides with a quadrature amplitude modulation
 (QAM) modulation. The scalable interplex is more power
 efficient than the QAM when the total power inefficiency
 falls below the corresponding dashed line, that represents the
 equivalent QAM scheme. For a better understanding of the
 trend of the chosen metric with increasing  , we decided to
 show also the case   . As we can see from Figure 3, for a
 typical HPA it is worth while introducing additional power in
 terms of IM products only for scalable interplex with   .
 For smaller values of  , the QAM scheme is more power
 efficient. Nevertheless, for a more non-linear HPA, for each
  there exists a value of the IM scaling factor different from
 zero that minimizes the power inefficiency ". The advantage
 of the scalable interplex is that it allows to adapt the signal
 modulation to the characteristics of the HPA at hand.

 3. CHANNEL CODE DESIGN FOR THE SHORT
 BLOCK LENGTH REGIME
 In this section, the potential of channel coding applied to
 the proposed scheme is investigated. More specifically, we
 introduce an error correction mechanism which is inspired by
 multi-level error correcting code [10].
 We assume the first    signal components to be encoded
 independently with   extended Hamming codes. The
  -th signal component is dedicated to carry additional redun-
 dancy computed across the signal components, e.g. the #-th
 bit of the  -th is obtained as the sum (over the binary field)
 of the #-th bit of each of the first    signal components’
 codewords. The resulting overall code can be seen as a
         product code [11] given by the
 serial concatenation of   extended Hamming codes
 with    single-parity-check codes. The advantage
 of this construction resides in the capability of embedding the
 main component legacy error correcting into a longer block
 code. This allows to keep the legacy part of the interplex
 backward compatible. A basic receiver may simply ignore the
 additional signal components, and perform error correction
 by using the legacy (e.g. Hamming or convolutional) error
 correcting code decoder. Enhanced receivers may exploit the
 additional components not only to retrieve more data, but also
 to enhance the robustness of the legacy component. In the
 latter case, decoding is performed iteratively (in a turbo-like
 fashion) [12–14] by exchanging soft information between
 the soft-input soft-output decoders of the Hamming and the
 single-parity-check codes [15].
 The proposed code construction may be further generalized,
 beyond the product construction, towards the class of general-
 ized low-density parity-check (G-LDPC) codes [3, 12, 16]. A
 G-LDPC code can be conveniently described by a bipartite
 graph [15] consisting of a set on 
 variable nodes (one
 for each codeword bit), $ constraint nodes (one for each
 subcode). The two sets of nodes are connected in a sparse
 manner, i.e., there are a few edges connecting variable and
 constrain nodes. An example of bipartite graph of a G-LDPC
 code is depicted in Fig. 5. In the figure, the constraint nodes
 (CNs) are the square nodes marked by %, %,   , %

 to signify the $ code constraints placed on the code bits
 associated with the CNs. Variable nodes (VNs) are denoted
 with circles. The specifications of the subcodes associated
 with the constraint nodes are also required. The bipartite

 CN of Hamming type and to one CN of single-parity-check
 type [15, 17].

 boost with respect to the secondary ones. Accordingly, the
 error rate measured over the secondary components suffers
 for a loss with respect to that of the main component, with
 a gap that increases for lower 

 negligible for 

 provided as a function of the SNR of the main component,
 the schemes employing more components take advantage of
 a higher overall power.

 4. CONCLUSIONS
 In this work we have proposed a novel interplex scheme
 which provides the capability of shaping the signal constel-
 lation allowing to adapt the signal to the available HPA in
 order to achieve low total power inefficiency.
 Furthermore, we have proposed an innovative coding scheme
 that encodes all signal components in a joint fashion de-
 veloping G-LDPC codes. This framework allows jointly
 encoding and decoding the legacy signal and the additional
 components. Simultaneously, the baseline code that is pro-
 tecting the legacy signal is embedded in the overall coding
 scheme. In this work we have presented an example of such
 a coding scheme based on extended Hamming codes instead
 of convolutional codes as defined in [1].
 Applying both the novel scalable interplex scheme and the
 proposed innovative coding scheme the available power can
 efficiently be used to increase the overall data rate for a
 multi-service SBAS without changing the legacy signal. The
