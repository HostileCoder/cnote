I.  INTRODUCTION 
Facing increasingly fierce global competition, it is crucial 
for make-to-order labor-intensive manufacturing to improve 
information visibility and transparency as well as the decision-
 making performance in supply chain  operations [1]. 
Some companies implemented various information systems 
to increase information visibility and transparency in 
distributed manufacturing environments. It is well known that 
the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology can 
enhance information visibility and traceability in supply chain 
[2]. In recent years, as the application of RFID technology has 
become economically feasible in labor-intensive manufacturing 
industry, some RFID-based information systems have been 
developed to collect accurate production data and track 
production progress real-timely, and their effectiveness has 
been proved by various industrial applications and practices. 
However, the existing data capture and tracking systems are 
designed for a separate plant. Nowadays, China’s labor-
 intensive companies in global manufacturing usually produce 
production orders in multiple subordinate and collaborative 
plants located in different regions. To track production in all 
plants effectively, some companies develop additional systems 
to integrate production data from different plants and save 
these data into a central database located at the headquarters. 
However, it is technologically complicated to synchronize the 
database located in different regions real-timely, and it also 
needs extra costs for secondary development and maintenance.  
It is thus necessary to develop an effective system to track 
and monitor the production progress in a distributed production 
manufacturing involving multiple production plants located in 
different regions. In recent years, cloud-based systems and 
applications have emerged as an important trend in information 
technology, which have been applied successfully in various 
organizations from government [3], manufacturing [4], 
healthcare [5] and education [6] sectors. However, cloud-based 
application in production tracking, and production decision-
 making has not been reported in labor-intensive manufacturing 
industries so far. 
Existing data capture systems installed in each plant can 
collect a huge number of real-time production data from 
production frontlines in labor-intensive manufacturing. 
However, these abundant data collected are mainly utilized for 
payroll recording and simple production reporting. There exists 
difficulty for production management to use these collected 
data to make effective production scheduling decisions.  
Today’s labor-intensive manufacturing is characterized by 
short lead-time, short life-cycle, volatile customer demands, 
and distributed multi-plant production environment. These 
characteristics increase the complexity of the production 
scheduling problem existing in the global labor-intensive 
manufacturing environment [7]. For these complex problems, 
traditional approaches, such as simulation, mathematical 
programming and heuristic methods, cannot provide effective 
scheduling solutions. In recent years, intelligent optimization 
algorithms have been more and more widely used in handling 
scheduling problems because they have the potential of seeking 
the global optimum [8]. However, no research has examined 
the production scheduling problems in a distributed 
manufacturing company from a holistic perspective.  
This paper will address the production tracking and 
scheduling problem faced by a distributed labor-intensive 
manufacturing company. A cloud-based intelligent tracking 
and scheduling system (CITSS) will be developed, in which 
cloud and RFID technologies are integrated for remote and 
real-time production data capture and tracking while intelligent 
techniques are used to generate effective production scheduling 
solutions.  
II. PROBLEM DESCRIPTION 
The production tasks of this type of companies in global 
manufacturing are completed in m  production plants, 
including self-owned or collaborative plants, located in 
different regions. These plants involve N  production 
departments numbered as 1 to N . These production 
departments can be classified into two categories: ordinary 
category and special category. Each category involves multiple

production departments. The departments of ordinary category 
are fully contained in all plants but it is possible that those of 
special category are only partly included (or not included) in 
some plants. Each department consists of multiple shop floors 
while each shop floor consists of multiple workstations or 
multiple assembly lines consisting of workstations. Each 
workstation is usually a physical location that accommodates 
an operator, a machine and a buffer. Fig. 1 shows the structure 
of the manufacturing company and the flowchart of production 
task allocation after receiving customer orders. In this figure, 
PDmn denotes the nth production department of plant m, SFmnp 
denotes the pth shop floor of PDmn.

The manufacturing company receives various production 
orders from different customers. Each group of production 
orders with the same due date from a same customer are called 
as an order group. After customer orders of an order group are 
confirmed, the manufacturer needs to purchase raw materials 
from material suppliers according to the materials requirement 
of customer orders. Labor-intensive manufacturing industries 
such as apparel and footwear are usually characterized by 
quick response manufacturing. It is very important to obtain 
raw materials in a timely manner. It is thus crucial to track the 
materials’ production so as to effectively monitor and control 
their production progress in suppliers’ plants. Moreover, to 
enhance production visibility, all production processes of 
customer orders need to be tracked and monitored effectively. 
Especially, manual operations have large effects on production 
performance in labor-intensive manufacturing, which are prone 
to being production bottleneck. Thus, production in 
workstations with key manual operations need to be tracked. 
Production management at different management levels have 
different tracking requirements according to their 
responsibilities. For example, production management at the 
head company need to track and oversee all orders while shop 
managers only need to track the orders in their shop floors.  
In a distributed labor-intensive environment with multiple 
plants, the purpose of production scheduling is to assign 
various production orders to appropriate shop floors or 
assembly lines of m  production plants for production.  Each 
order consists of a maximum of N  production processes, 
which need to be performed in production departments 1 to N , 
respectively. That is, production process i  can only be 
produced in production department i  ( Ni ,...,1= ). Each 
production process of an order is assigned to only one plant for 
processing, which indicates that it is possible that different 
production processes of an order need to be performed in 
different plants. In real-world production practice, scheduling 
tasks are performed by production management at different 
management levels, respectively, so as to assign production 
tasks to appropriate production units. Some important real-
 world problem features in production scheduling of labor-
 intensive manufacturing need to be considered, including 
multiple scheduling objectives and various uncertainties.  
The problem addressed aims at tracking and monitoring 
each order’s production progress accurately from material 
production to packing process in a real-time manner and 
determining where and when each production process of each 
order needs to be produced based on real-time data. 
III. CLOUD-BASED INTELLIGENT TRACKING AND 
SCHEDULING SYSTEM  
A. System architecture 
Fig. 2 shows the architecture of the CITSS. RFID 
technology is used to collected production data from 
distributed manufacturing environments on a real-time basis 
while intelligent optimization techniques are used to make 
scheduling decisions. This architecture involves an RFID-
 based production data capture (RPDC) model, a data capture 
middleware, a real-time production database, a data analysis 
and processing (DAP) model, a production decision-making 
database, a cloud-based real-time production tracking (CRPT) 
model and a remote intelligent production scheduling (RIPS) 
model. Except for the RPDC model running in distributed 
plants, other models are all run remotely in the servers located 
at the company’s headquarters. This architecture is thus a 
cloud-based system architecture. Further speaking, this 
architecture fits in the concept of community cloud.  
The RPDC model is in charge of collecting real-time 
production records, from each workstation in all plants based 
on RFID technology. These production records collected are 
transferred to the remote data capture middleware, which is in 
charge of receiving the data from the RPDC model, entering 
the production data into the real-time production database and 
providing access to the data. The real-time production database 
stores production data by using MySQL, MS SQL Server, or 
Oracle according to specific data processing requirements. 
Based on the data collected, the DAP model analyzes and 
preprocesses these data, extracts necessary summary data and 
then save them into the production decision-making database. 
Based on the data collected, the CRPT model is developed to 
track and monitor the production progress of each production 
order in plants. The RISD model is developed to generate 
effective scheduling decisions based on intelligent optimization 
techniques. These models provide user-friendly interfaces to 
remotely interact with users from different production units 
421
 
based on web technologies. The following subsections describe 
four key models of the CITSS.

B. RFID-based production data capture (RPDC) model 
The RPDC model is composed of submodels installed in 
each plant. Fig. 3 shows the structure of an RPDC submodel 
installed in a shop floor or an assembly line. Each shop floor or 
assembly line uses the same way to collect production records. 
In each workstation, an RFID terminal is installed, which reads 
the RFID tag attached to each workpiece to capture the starting 
time and the end time of each workpiece being processed on 
this workstation. The RFID terminals in each submodel are 
integrated into an intranet by the switch. The switch is a device 
that channels incoming data from any of the multiple input 
ports to the specified output port that takes the data toward its 
intended destination, which is connected with a data capture 
middleware. The data communication between the switch and 
the middleware uses the TCP/IP protocol.  
The RFID tags used in this model are passive RFID tags 
with the low frequency of 125 KHZ, which are low cost and 
technically mature for industrial use. Only the tag ID is stored 
in the memory of the tag. Other information related to the 
RFID tags is stored in the remote real-time production 
database. Each tag ID is mapped with the additional 
information of the tag through the real-time production 
database.  
Except for the data collected by the RFID terminals, some 
information, including the given data of production orders, 
shop floors, assembly lines, workstations and operators, are 
also input directly by computer operators from each shop floor 
through a web-based program imbedded into the RPDC model. 
The program provides the computer operator an user-friendly 
interface to input related production information.

C. Data analysis and processing model 
The amount of real-time production data collected from 
production frontline is huge. Although a huge number of real-
 time production records are collected, only these raw data are 
insufficient to implement production tracking and making 
production decisions. The DAP model is thus developed to 
extract necessary parameters from the real-time production 
database and placed them into the production decision-making 
database according to specific tracking and scheduling 
requirements. The necessary parameters are used in CRPT and 
RISD models, which include: (1) the operator and machine 
configuration of each production unit; (2) the information of 
each order, including operations involved in this order and each 
operation’s standard allowed minute (SAM); (3) daily working 
records of each operator.   
D. Cloud-based real-time production tracking (CRPT) model 
Production management at different management levels, 
including company, plant and shop levels, need to track and 
monitor the production progress of customer orders timely and 
accurately according to their job responsibilities. The CRPT 
model is thus designed and developed by integrating 
production tracking functions at 3 different levels, namely 
company level, plant level and shop floor level.  
Fig. 4 shows the structure of the CRPT model. This model 
is actually a web-based production monitoring program, which 
connects with the remote production decision-making database 
and provides a user friendly web portal to help production 
management  to track and monitor each order’s production 
progress. The web portal gives production management at 
different levels easy access to the information consistent with 
their job requirements. The users at each management level can 
browse information related to his/her job responsibility by web 
browsers in microcomputers and mobile phones with Internet 
connections according to their access rights.

E. Remote intelligent production scheduling model 
An intelligent technique-based scheduling mechanism is 
presented to handle production scheduling tasks at different 
management levels from a holistic perspective. Production 
management at different levels need to determine how to 
assign orders to appropriate production units and the 
processing sequences of these orders in these production units. 
Fig. 5 shows the flowchart of the RIPS model for a distributed 
labor-intensive manufacturing environment involving multiple 
plants. The scheduling mechanism in this model implements 
production scheduling task in the distributed environment by 
decomposing the scheduling task into 3 order scheduling 
problems at the following 3 management levels: 
 
 
Fig. 5. Flowchart of the RIPS model 
(1) Company level: After new production orders from a 
customer is confirmed,  the order scheduling submodel at 
company level determines how to assign each production order 
from customers to an appropriate plant.  
(2) Plant level: After production order assigned by the head 
company are confirmed, the order scheduling submodel at the 
plant level decides how to assign each order from the head 
company to one or more appropriate shop floors in this plant. 
(3) Shop level: The scheduling submodel at this level 
decides how to schedule the production of orders in a shop 
floor. In some production environments such as sewing, each 
shop floor consists of multiple assembly lines. In this case, it is 
necessary to decide how to assign orders to each assembly line. 
Production orders are assigned for production according to 
the scheduling solutions generated. After a group of orders 
from a customer is produced, the finished products are finally 
delivered to the destinations specified by the customer. In 
addition, users at different management levels can access these 
scheduling submodels through Internet connections. 
Scheduling solutions at each management level are saved into 
the production decision-making database on a real-time basis, 
and used as input parameters of scheduling and decision-
 making processes at lower management level so that more 
transparent and timely information sharing can be achieved. 
In real-world production practice, the three scheduling 
problems at different levels need to consider various labor-
 intensive production features, such as multiple plants, multiple 
shop floors, multiple orders, multiple production objectives and 
production uncertainties. These features make these problems 
become complex uncertain multi-objective combinatorial 
optimization problems, for which traditional optimization 
techniques cannot provide optimal or near-optimal solutions. 
The first author has proposed a hybrid intelligent decision-
 making model to solve an order allocation problem with the 
consideration of multiple objectives production uncertainties 
[9]. In this model, various production uncertainties, such as 
uncertain order arrival time and uncertain processing time, are 
described by random variables, multi-objective intelligent 
optimization and Monte Carlo simulation techniques are 
integrated to generate Pareto optimal solutions.  The optimum-
 seeking process of the hybrid intelligent model can be utilized 
to handle production scheduling problems at different levels. 
The main procedures involved in this optimum-seeking process 
can be described briefly as follows: 
(1) A multi-objective intelligent optimization submodel is 
adopted firstly to generate the initial Pareto optimal solutions to 
the deterministic production scheduling problem. The 
deterministic problem does not consider production uncertainty 
by assuming that all uncertain orders need to be produced and 
the processing time of an order in a production department 
equals the mean of its processing time in this department.  
(2) To tackle the stochastic production scheduling problem, 
the Monte Carlo simulation submodel is then employed to 
evaluate performance (fitness) of each initial Pareto optimal 
solution under various uncertainties in production scheduling.  
423
 
(3) Based on the fitness of initial solutions for the stochastic 
problem, the heuristic pruning submodel is finally used to 
generate the final optimal solutions for  production practice.   
IV. SYSTEM IMPLEMENTATION AND EVALUATION 
A. System Development and Implementation  
To evaluate the effectiveness of the CITSS architecture 
proposed in section III, a pilot system was developed and a 
distributed apparel manufacturing company with multiple 
plants was selected as the pilot company to evaluate this 
system. The  pilot manufacturing company has 4 production 
plants located in 4 different cities, which receives production 
orders from its global customers and produces these order in its 
4 plants according to customers’ requirements.  These plants 
include 5 types of production departments, including cutting, 
silk-screen, sewing, finishing and packaging. Each production 
department includes one or more shop floors. Each sewing 
shop floor consists of multiple assembly lines while other shop 
floor consists of multiple workstations. In each plant, different 
production departments are included.  
The pilot system contains the functions of remote 
production tracking and production scheduling at company 
level. In the pilot manufacturing company,  one shop floor in 
each production department of each plant was selected out to 
implement and test the pilot system.  
In apparel manufacturing, sewing production has the largest 
effects on production performance of each plant. An RFID 
terminal is thus installed in each sewing workstation in sewing 
assembly lines to capture the production records of each 
sewing operations. In cutting department, RFID terminals are 
installed in each cutting workstation to capture the output of 
cutting pieces from each cutting bed. In silk-screen department, 
each bundle of garments is collected while the production 
record of each piece of garment is collected in finishing 
department. In packing department, RFID terminals collect the 
records of each carton of garments. In addition, three RFID 
terminals are installed in a fabric supplier’s shop floors to track 
the production progress of main fabric materials.  
The pilot system was developed on the basis of Java/J2EE, 
SQL Server 2005 and web technologies. The production 
management at different levels can track the production 
progress of each order by some summarized reports, and also 
assign each order to an appropriate plant. Some examples of 
interfaces of the pilot system are shown in Fig.s 6-8.  
Fig. 6 shows an interface illustrating the comparison of 
production efficiency and progress for different operations’ in a 
production unit. By this interface, one can compare the average 
efficiency and progress of different operations of a production 
order being processed in a plant, a production department, a 
shop floor or an assembly line. It can be clearly found if the 
production flow of an order is smooth in a production unit. One 
can also compare the actual operating time of each operation  
with its SAM value by this interface. For example, the average 
operating time of operation ‘001’ and its SAM value is 20 and 
22 seconds respectively. This interface can be used by 
production management at different levels to track each order’s 
production detail. 
 
 
Fig. 6. Interface 1 – Production detail of operations in an order 
 
Fig. 7. Interface 2 – Production detail of orders in an order group 
 
Fig. 7 shows an interface illustrating the comparison of 
production progress of all orders in an order group, which is 
designed for production management at plant and company 
levels to track each order and each order group’s production 
progress. As shown in this figure, the order group “NKE-
 SP01B1” consists of 21 orders. On the whole, 55% total 
workload of this order group has been completed. 89% 
workload of order 2 has been completed while only 18% 
workload of order 9 was completed. By this interface, one can 
compare the production progress and average operating time 
for each product of different orders in an order group.  
Fig. 8 shows the interface of showing the solution of 
assigning production orders to different plants, which is the 
result of production scheduling at company level. As shown in 
this figure, the orders of order group ‘NIT-WI12-2B’ are 
assigned to plant 2 while the orders of order group ‘OKY-
 SP13-1S’ are assigned to plant 1 for processing. Each 
production order can only be assigned to one plant for 
424
 
production due to its small-batch feature. In addition, the 
sequence of orders shown in the table represents their sequence 
to be produced in the corresponding plant.

company level 
B. Evaluation  
The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is evaluated 
by examining the benefits brought by the pilot system. Before 
the pilot system was developed and implemented in the pilot 
manufacturing company, production data were collected by 
manual recordings and the production management could not 
track the production progress of each order in a real-time and 
accurate manner. The production schedulers at the headquarters 
made production scheduling decisions by assigning each order 
to an appropriate plant based on their experience and subjective 
judgments, which generated lowly efficient solutions.  
After the pilot system was run in the pilot company for 
more than 6 months, the system performance was analyzed and 
evaluated by comparing the production performance of latest 3 
months and the performance of the same 3 months of last year 
before the system was implemented. On the basis of the 
comparison in the two selected periods, the pilot company 
reported that the following tangible benefits have been 
achieved: 
(1) 8% reduction in labor and system costs: No computer 
operator is required to input job tickets records now. The pilot 
system needs less computer servers, less installation and 
maintenance costs, less IT-related and IE-related manpower. 
(2) 25% increase in production efficiency: The real-time 
and accurate production data collected and effective production 
scheduling decisions generated by the pilot system can 
definitely improve production efficiencies.  
(3) 12% reduction in production waste: Effective order 
tracking and monitoring leads to more transparent production 
process, which has direct effects on reducing overproduction, 
defects, and in-process inventories. Effective order scheduling 
decreases the possibility of rush production, which is also 
helpful to reduce defects. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
A production tracking and scheduling system was 
developed to make effective production tracking and 
scheduling in a distributed labor-intensive manufacturing 
environment based on a cloud-based system architecture and 3 
different management levels. Due to its cloud-based and easily 
accessible feature, except for the subordinate plants, real-time 
production data can also be collected conveniently from 
supplying and outsourcing plants. These data collected are 
transferred to remote real-time production database via TCP/IP 
protocol, and are then analyzed and extracted to be used in 
production scheduling decision-makings. The intelligent 
technique-based scheduling mechanism is able to handle 
production scheduling tasks in distributed labor-intensive 
manufacturing environments from a holistic perspective.  
The effectiveness of the CITSS was validated by the 
application of a pilot system in a distributed apparel 
manufacturing company with multiple plants. By implementing 
this system, better supply chain coordination and better 
production scheduling decisions can be achieved so as to 
provide its customers with better services.
