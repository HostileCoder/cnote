Abstract—In recent years, with the improvement of sensor 
technologies, the volumes of remote sensing data are increased 
dramatically. The feature extraction of hyperspectral remotely 
sensed images can reduce such high-dimensional datasets, solve 
the big data problem, avoid the Hughes phenomena and 
improve the classification performance. Accordingly, this 
paper presents a framework for feature extraction of 
hyperspectral imagery, which consists of two approaches, 
referred to as parallel particle swarm optimization (PPSO) band 
selection and weighted voting impurity function (WVIF) band 
prioritization. The highly correlated bands of hyperspectral 
imagery can be grouped first into the some modules by PPSO 
band selection algorithm to coarsely reduce high-dimensional 
datasets, and these highly correlated band modules can then be 
analyzed with the statistical relationship between bands and 
classes by WVIF band prioritization method to finely select the 
most important feature bands form the datasets. Furthermore, 
a PPSO algorithm based on modern graphics processing unit 
(GPU) architecture using NVIDIA compute unified device 
architecture (CUDA) technology is using in this paper. It can 
improve the computational speed of PPSO band selection to 
group the high correlated band modules. The effectiveness of 
the proposed PPSO/WVIF framework is evaluated by 
MASTER and AVIRIS hyperspectral images. The 
experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method 
not only could reduction the dimension of datasets, but also can 
offer a satisfactory classification performance and 
computational speed.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Due to recent advances in remote sensing instruments the 
number of spectral bands used in these instruments to collect 
data has significantly increased. The advances of sensor 
technologies make it possible to utilize a growing number of 
spectral bands. High-dimensional remote sensing data sets 
obtained from multispectral, hyperspectral or even 
ultraspectral bands generally provide enormous spectral 
information for data analysis. But this improved spectral 
resolution also comes at a price, known as the curse of 
dimensionality. The term curse of dimensionality is used by 
the statistical community to describe the difficulties 
associated with the feasibility of distribution estimation in 
high-dimensional data sets. The datasets cover an abundance 
of applications from satellite remote sensing imaging to 
medical examination imaging. World-wide researchers all 
report the difficulties, regarding its distribution estimation. 
Accordingly, how to extract the most valuable and 
meaningful information has become much more essential.  
 
Pearson proposed a principal component analysis (PCA) 
[1] to convert a set of correlated high-dimensional data 
variables into a set of values of linearly uncorrelated 
variables for feature extraction. A technique known as 
greedy modular eigenspaces (GME) [2] has been developed 
for the band selection of hyperspectral datasets. GME 
attempts to greedily select a near-optimal unique feature set 
from hyperspectral images. A new simulated annealing band 
selection (SABS) [3] based on GME is also reported to 
improve to the performances of GME feature extraction.  
 
Recently, Chang et al. presented a novel parallel band 
selection approach, referred to as parallel particle swarm 
optimization (PPSO) [4], for hyperspectral feature extraction. 
They also introduced a novel band prioritization based on 
impurity function (IF) [5] for hyperspectral band selection. 
The proposed IF band selection (IFBS) used PPSO scheme 
to develop an effective feature extraction algorithm for 
hyperspectral imagery. After PPSO method is applied to the 
band reduction of hyperspectral images, the proposed IFBS 
is applied to enhance the efficiency of band selection.  
 
In this paper, an improved version of feature extraction 
scheme, namely weighted voting impurity function (WVIF), 
based on IFBS algorithm is proposed by using a novel 
weighted majority voting system to finely select the most 
important feature bands form the highly correlated bands 
collected coarsely by PPSO band selection approach. The 
new proposed PPSO/WVIF framework fully utilize the 
PPSO approach on coarse-grain band selection and the 
WVIF scheme on fine-grain feature extraction for 
hyperspectral images. Furthermore, a modern graphics 
processing unit (GPU) architecture using NVIDIA compute 
unified device architecture (CUDA) technology is used to 
speed up  PPSO algorithm in this paper. It can improve the

The efficiency of proposed method is evaluated by 
MODIS/ASTER airborne simulator (MASTER) 
hyperspectral images and AVIRIS hyperspectral images. The 
experimental results demonstrated that proposed method can 
obtain significant feature bands in terms of the efficiency of 
dimension reductions and classification. The rest of this 
paper is organized as follows. Section II introduces the 
proposed methods. Experimental results are shown in section 
III. Finally, we draw our conclusion in Section  IV. 
 
 
II. METHODOLOGY 
 
A. Reviews of GME 
 
In Fig.1, a visual correlation matrix pseudo-color map 
(CMPM) is used to emphasize the second-order statistics in 
hyperspectral data and to illustrate the magnitude of 
correlation matrices in the proposed PPSO method. In our 
previous works, we proposed a GME set which is composed 
of a group of modular eigenspaces for the class k as also 
shown in Fig. 1. Reordering the bands regardless of the 
original order in terms of wavelengths in high-dimensional 
data sets is an important characteristic of the GME. Each 
modular eigenspace includes a set of highly correlated bands.    
In hyperspectral imagery, GME has been developed by 
clustering highly correlated hyperspectral bands into a 
smaller subset of band modular based on greedy algorithm. 
B. PPSO/IFBP 
Figure 2. The flow chart of PPSO/IFBP framework. 
 
Starting from the raw data through the process of band 
selection to perform the classification, the whole PPSO/IFBP 
classification flow for hyperspectral images is shown in the 
Fig.2. It would be summarized into four steps: 
 
1. Slice out training samples and test samples from raw data 
and normalize them. 
2. Realize the single class high correlation bands of PPSO 
algorithm. 
3. Use IFBP statistics the relationship between classes and 
bands and to reduce the data dimensionality by using the  
weighted majority voting to extracting the key bands as 
the representatives. 
4. Finally, use k-nearest neighbor (KNN) classifier to 
produce the classification map from the selected bands. 
 
Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a swarm 
intelligence algorithm originally designed to solve the 
nonlinear function optimization and neural network training 
problems [6]. PPSO scheme is a well-known method to solve 
the heuristic optimization problems. PPSO band selection [5] 
can group highly correlated bands of hyperspectral images 
into several high corrected modules. However, the PPSO is 
difficult to identify which bands are the most significant 
bands in each high corrected module for the image 
classification. IFBP [5] is incorporated with PPSO band 
selection to improve the band prioritization while increasing 
classification accuracy. 
After applying PPSO band selection to hyperspectral 
images, the IFBP is then deployed for band prioritization. A 
visualization of the IFBP method is shown in Fig 2. There 
are two classes (A and B) and two bands (bm and bn) in this 
example. In Fig. 3, one training sample of class A and three 
training samples  of class  B  are overlapped within the two

dotted lines in band bm. One training sample of class A and 
five training samples of class B are overlapped within the 
two dotted lines in band bn. The IFBP measures the sample 
probabilities of overlapped structure by an impurity function 
[7]. The measure of the class overlapping (Ob) based on 
IFBP for band #b is defined in Eq. (1).

where i  j, b represents the band #b and C is the total 
number of classes. pi and pj are the sample probabilities of 
overlapped structure between class i and class j in band bm 
and band bn, e.g., pi is 1/6 of class A and pj is 5/6 of class B 
for band bm as shown in Fig 3. There are totally fifteen (6 x 
5)/2 combination measures of Ob when six different classes 
(C = 6) are applied to IFBP. They are then summed up to 
calculate a total of Ob. If the value of Ob is 1, it means that 
no classes are overlapped to each other in band b. The 
minimum value of Ob is 1 - C. In this case, the training 
pixels of all classes are fully mixed. 
 
C. WVIF 
 
As shown in Fig.1, a visual CMPM is used to illustrate 
the magnitude of correlation matrices. The GME set is 
composed of a group of modular eigenspaces for the class k 
as also shown in Fig. 4. The GME k is the set of GME 
modules for different k classes, where k {1,…,C} and nk  is 
the number of modular eigenspace for k. lk represents the l 
modular eigenspace of k, where , and mk 
represents the number of bands in lk. Ob is the class

overlapping as reported in the previous subsection. The 
proposed WVIF method makes use of both the model of the 
GME k and the order of the class overlapping Ob  (the more, 
the better) to select the most important band in different lk 
based on the bands statistical relationship of the within-class 
as shown in Fig. 5 and between-class as shown in Fig. 6. 
These two statistics (within-class and between-class) are then 
summed up by their order of class overlapping Ob. Finally,

the most important feature bands are selected, including 
Band #1, #2, #4 and #5 in this case, as shown in Fig. 7.  
 
As a result, the highly correlated bands of hyperspectral 
imagery can be grouped first into the some modules by 
PPSO band selection algorithm to coarsely reduce high-
 dimensional datasets, and these highly correlated band 
modules can then be analyzed with the statistical relationship 
between bands and classes by WVIF band prioritization 
method to finely select the most important feature bands 
form the datasets.  
 
D. Parallel Computing Process 
The natural parallelism of proposed PSO is in the face 
that each particle can be regarded as an independent agent. 
Parallel computation benefits the algorithm by providing 
each agent with one of the parallel processors [8]. The 
intrinsic parallel characteristics embedded in the proposed 
PPSO can be therefore suitable for a parallel implementation. 
Fig.8 illustrates a data flow comparison between PSO and 
parallel PSO approaches. 
 
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS  
In this paper, two plantation areas are chosen for 
investigation. They are the MASTER set of Au-Ku and the 
AVIRIS set of Northwest Tippecanoe County (NTC). At 
Au-Ku data set, 30 training samples and 120 testing samples 
for each class with 44 bands, there were 6 classes in this 
data set; at NTC data set, 20 training samples and 80 testing 
samples for each class with 220 bands, there were 9 classes 
in this data set. Five correlation coefficient (CC) thresholds, 
CC = 0.7 0.9 with a offset of 0.05, were selected to carry 
out the experiments. The parameters used for PSO are 
initialized as follows. The inertia weight  is set as 0.8 to 
0.4. The acceleration constants (cognitive confidence 
coefficients) c1 is 2 and c2 is 1.25. All of the multiple 
combinations of parameters stated above are averaged to 
obtain the experimental results.

The results appeared in Fig. 11 show that an efficient 
critical point around CC = 0.7 can be reached to obtain a 
high quality DRR along with a lower VCA impact. In the 
proposed parallel PPSO, the speedup almost proportional to 
amount of the number of particles with two sets of image 
data as shown in Fig. 13. The more particles the better the 
speedups. This result can well demonstrate the efficiency of 
the proposed PSO process. 
IV. CONCLUSION  
 In this paper, we propose the PSO/WVIF framework for 
feature extraction of hyperspectral imagery. Firstly, the PSO 
band selection algorithm can grouped highly correlated 
bands of hyperspectral imagery into the some modules to 
coarsely reduce high-dimensional datasets.  Secondly, these 
highly correlated band modules can then be statistically 
analyzed among bands and classes by WVIF band 
prioritization method to finely select the most important 
feature bands form the datasets. In order to speed up the 
proposed processes, a parallel PSO algorithm based on 
modern graphics processing unit (GPU) architecture using 
NVIDIA compute unified device architecture (CUDA) 
technology is implemented in this paper to improve the 
computational speed of PSO band selection to group the 
high correlated band modules. The effectiveness of the 
proposed PSO/WVIF framework is evaluated by MASTER 
and AVIRIS hyperspectral images. The experimental results 
demonstrated that the proposed method not only could 
reduction the dimension of datasets, but also can offer a 
satisfactory classification performance and computational 
speed.
