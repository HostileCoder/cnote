 AbstractÑIndoor downlink communication contributes to a
 large part of the data traffic generated in todayÕs world. The
 demand for high rate wireless indoor coverage while providing
 complete support to the existing wireless technologies is a big
 challenge. The future proof centralized optical fiber indoor back
 haul for efficient indoor coverage is gaining a lot of attention
 recently. Physical layer techniques like multiuser MIMO (MU-
 MIMO) is becoming an inevitable approach in this regard.
 Quality of service serves as the most attractive feature that
 should be ensured among the mobile terminals (MTs). In this
 work we try to study the effects of imperfections in channel
 knowledge owing to estimation errors. We study the effects of
 it on our previously proposed throughput fair successive signal
 to leakage and noise ratio (SLNR) precoding algorithm [1] for
 such a fiber-wireless (Fi-Wi) MU-MIMO indoor. Our algorithm
 has been shown previously to achieve maximal fairness. In this
 paper we use MMSE alterations to significantly reduce the effect
 of estimation errors for our scheme. We provide a lower bound
 on the sum rate achievable with imperfect CSIT. In this paper we
 also compare different power allocation policies. Power allocation
 policies plays an important part in improving the performance
 of the system in terms of BER of the worst case user. We show
 that channel adaptive power allocation guarantees approximately
 3dB SNR improvement over the equal power allocation policy for
 BER of 10?7.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 Indoor downlink is a large contributor to the data traffic
 transferred in todays world. Rapid growth in smartphone
 industry and cheap end devices that demands for high data
 rates, the growth of downlink traffic indoor is increasing
 rapidly year after year. Such high data rate services indoor calls
 for innovative wireless techniques such as Multi-User Multiple
 Input Multiple Output (MU-MIMO) in combination with the
 future proof optical fiber backhaul infrastructure installation.
 Hybrid Fiber-Wireless (Fi-Wi) infrastructure provides mobile
 terminals (MTs) with dual flexibility of mobility and central-
 ized controlled networking. Spatially multiplexed data streams
 for different MTs carried over different optical wavelengths
 provides clean transport of multi-user multi transmit antenna
 signal and thus provide multi-user diversity while diminishing
 the cell sizes, such that the transmit power can be reduced
 significantly.
 The use of Fi-Wi architecture for distributing the radio
 signals in indoor spaces is growing [2], [3].The hybrid Fi-
 Wi network described in our paper consists of a fiber in-
 frastructure, controlled by a central Home Communication
 Fig. 1. Hybrid Fiber-Wireless Indoor Architecture
 Controller (HCC). The HCC serves as the brain of the network.
 Using Radio over Fiber (RoF) technology, the radio signals
 are distributed across the Cell Access Nodes (CANs) inside
 rooms to cover the immediate periphery of the indoor network
 (see Fig.1). This figure is motivated from [4]. The CANs are
 assumed to be MIMO enabled i.e., they have multiple transmit
 antennas to either support single user MIMO or MU-MIMO.
 MU-MIMO system with perfect Channel State Information
 at the transmitter (CSIT) can significantly improve the network
 performance. Due to the difficulty in attaining perfect CSIT
 owing to a large number of channel parameters to be estimated
 at the receivers and then fed back to the transmitter, the MIMO
 systems with imperfect CSI is a more relaxed and realistic as-
 sumption for todayÕs network. CSIT with error is a form of par-
 tial CSIT, which is caused by non-ideal estimation technique or
 non-ideal feedback. In this paper we present a precoding and
 scheduling scheme based on maximizing the so called SLNR
 in presence of channel estimation error. Information theoretic
 studies show that when the accurate CSI of all users are known
 at the transmitter, the broadcast channel capacity grows with
 the number of users at the rate of Nloglog(MK), where N
 is the number of transmit antennas at the Base Station(BS),
 M is the number of receive antennas at each user and K
 is the number of all users. The performance is degraded by
 reduced SNR due to the deviation caused by imperfect CSIT.
 In our paper we investigate the issue of improving the network
 MU-MIMO capacity under imperfect CSIT while rendering
 specific MT oriented Quality of Service (QoS). Fig.1 gives a
 978-1-4799-3206-1/13/$31.00 c©2013 IEEE
general overview of the overall network. But to ensure overall
 improvement we have to ensure improvement over each and
 every cell area supported by each single multi-antenna element
 CAN. Here we consider the case of a single cell area served by
 a single multi-antenna CAN supporting multiple MTs. When
 perfect channel state information is available at the HCC
 (CSIT) and MTs (CSIR) the dirty paper coding (DPC) [5]
 scheme is the optimal capacity attaining scheme for MU-
 MIMO downlink. DPC is impracticable to implement because
 of the high computation complexity due to non linearity. Linear
 beam forming techniques although are suboptimal approaches
 but they help to reduce the computational complexity. In [6]
 the authors proposed a precoding scheme based on signal to
 leakage-noise ratio (SLNR). SLNR is a transmitter side per-
 formance measure. In comparison with co channel interference
 (CCI) which represents the amount of signal power received
 from unwanted MTs to the desired MT, SLNR represents the
 amount of signal power from the desired MT leaked onto
 other MTs. It has been shown in [6] that SLNR performs
 better than a simple zero-forcing (ZF) scheme. With linear
 beamforming, the number of transmitting antennas should be
 greater than or equal to all the receiving antennas across all
 MTs unless time shared. In our Fi-Wi architecture we assume
 that the number of antennas across all MTs are larger than the
 number of antennas at the CAN and hence only a subset of
 MTs get served at a particular time slot. One of the driving
 objectives for such a hybrid Fi-Wi indoor network architecture
 is to maximize the system throughput. SINR scheduling in this
 case serves as the most instinctive objective as maximization
 of SINR directly relates to maximizing system capacity. SINR
 is a MT parameter. The work in this paper is an extension
 of our previous work [1] which accounts for the QoS oriented
 network capacity improvement under perfect CSIT assumption
 assuming equal power allocation policy for the users.
 Our paper models a downlink MU-MIMO for Fi-Wi indoor
 environment supporting SLNR precoding and scheduling at the
 HCC under imperfect CSIT. Based on the MMSE alteration on
 the imperfect CSIT we obtain a close approximate estimate
 of the CSIT. For supporting individual QoS across MTs we
 make use of our previously proposed Fair-SLNR scheduling
 algorithm [1]. We also propose a mathematical lower bound
 on the achievable sumrate due to imperfect estimation of CSIT.
 Further the comparison of the Fair-SLNR scheme under equal
 power allocation (EPA) and channel adaptive power alloca-
 tion (CAPA) is compared in terms of information theoretic
 parameter network capacity and average network bit error
 rate. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section 2
 introduces the system model. Section 3 describes the channel
 modification using MMSE estimation. Section 4 gives an
 overview of our Fair-SLNR scheme which was introduced
 in [1]. Section 5 provides a mathematical lower bound on
 the achievable sumrate under imperfect CSIT. Section 6 talks
 about channel adaptive power allocation policy. Section 7
 discusses the simulation results and Section 8 concludes the
 paper summarizing our main results.
 II. SYSTEM MODEL
 We consider the downlink MU-MIMO scenario for Fi-
 Wi indoor environment (see Fig.2) where HCC is trying to
 communicate with K users having one antenna each via
 a single CAN with N transmit antennas. We assume that

 Imperfect CSIT
 K >> N . The fiber provides a clean transport of the signal
 for different antennas across the CAN using different optical
 wavelength. CAN is used to radiate the signals for different
 MTs after optical to electrical conversion. As shown in Fig.2
 the signals for different MTs generated at the access point (AP)
 in HCC after SLNR precoding and scheduling are optically
 modulated onto different wavelengths using Wavelength Divi-
 sion Multiplexing (WDM). The different optical wavelengths
 are then transported through the fiber to the CAN where optical
 to electrical conversion is done at each individual antenna of
 the CAN and the signal is radiated in the cell area. Different
 antenna elements across the CAN are thus accessed using
 different optical wavelengths making the system transparent.
 For analysis we assume that the optical channel is perfect and
 hence introduces no error. Notation: The rest of the paper uses
 upper case bold face for matrices and lower case bold face for
 vectors. AT , AH and |A| are used to denote the transpose,
 hermitian and the Frobenius norm of matrix A respectively.
 Let hk(t) ? C1?N denotes the channel gain from the antennas
 across the CAN to MT k at time t. Quasi-static time variant
 spatially uncorrelated Rayleigh fading is assumed. Quasi static
 time varying indoor channel is a good assumption which is
 validated by [7]. The spatially uncorrelated channel assumption
 is true as we assume that the separation between the antenna
 elements in the CAN to be at least half wavelength apart.
 For a specific time slot t the transmitted symbol of MT k is
 given by xk(t). The transmitted symbol is pre-multiplied by a
 unit norm beamforming precoding vector bk(t). The received
 signal vector at MT k can thus be written as
 rk(t) = hk(t)
 K·
 i=1
 bi(t)xi(t) + wk(t)
 = hk(t)bk(t)xk(t) +
 hk(t)
 K·
 i6=k
 bi(t)xi(t) + wk(t) (1)
 where, wk(t) ? N(0, ?2) represents the additive white Gaus-
 sian noise. The power allocation across all the MTs are
assumed equal which we refer as Equal power allocation
 policy (EPA). We also assume that the signal variance is equal
 to 1 and the signals for different MTs are not correlated. The
 SLNR for MT k at time slot t can be given by
 SLNRk(t) = |hk(t)bk(t)|
 2
 ?2 +
 ·
 i6=k |hi(t)bk(t)|2 (2)
 In our previous paper [1] we assumed perfect CSIT. But, the
 assumption that HCC has perfect CSIT is not ideal, so we try to
 relax the perfect CSIT assumption to an imperfect CSIT with
 estimation errors at the MTs. In this paper we are however
 neglecting the imperfection in CSIT caused due to feedback
 delay. As we assumed that the channels are quasi-static, so the
 imperfection caused due to feedback delay is assumed to have
 minimal impact.
 A. Error Estimation of Channel
 We assume that the techniques used at the MTs for channel
 estimation is not perfect, and it introduces error. Thus the HCC
 will obtain CSI with error. Let us denote the perfect CSI as
 hk(t) for user k at time t, the erroneous estimates as öhk(t)
 and the divergence between them as the error,
 ek(t) = hk(t)? öhk(t) (3)
 The distribution of ek(t) are CN (0, ?2eI) [8]. The quality of
 channel estimation is indicated by the error variance and is
 assumed to be known to both at the HCC and the MTs.
 The degradation in performance of SLNR based scheme is
 significant due to error estimates in CSI. We can however make
 minimum mean square error (MMSE) based alteration, so that
 we obtain a close approximation of the CSI by reducing the
 effect of estimation error.
 III. CHANNEL MODIFICATION
 This section aims to estimate a modification matrix of
 size N ? N using the MMSE based approach to reduce the
 significant effect of estimation error. For notational simplicity
 in this part we neglect the time index. Let us denote the
 channel modification matrix as F and the full channel estimate
 matrix as öH. The entries of öH includes the imperfect CSI
 received from the MTs. The equivalent channel matrix after
 modification can be expressed as,
 ÿH = öHF (4)
 The modification matrix Fopt can be obtained by minimizing
 MSE = E
 [??H? ÿH??2] satisfying power constraint can be
 given by,
 Fopt = argminTr(F?F)=1E
 [??H? ÿH??2] (5)
 By equating the gradient of the MSE with respect to F and
 equating to zero we obtain [9],
 `Fopt = (K?2eI + H?H)?1(H?H) (6)
 where, H represents the full channel matrix. The obtained
 `Fopt is a global minimizer which can be easily proved by
 deriving the Hessian matrix and noticing that the Hessian
 matrix is positive definite. Normalising `Fopt to satisfy the
 power constraint gives,
 Fopt = `Fopt/
 Ã
 Tr
 (
 `F?opt `Fopt
 )
 (7)
 The minimum mean square error variance becomes [9],
 ?2mod = E
 [??H? ÿH??2] = ?2e/r r·
 i=1
 ?i/(?i + ?2e) (8)
 where r is the rank and ?1, .....?r are the non zero eigen values
 of the full transmit channel covariance matrix Hcov which is
 given as,
 Hcov = E [H?H] (9)
 Therefore after modification to account for the erroneous
 channel state information the modified SLNR can be given
 as
 SLNRmodk (t)=
 b?k(t)
 (
 ÿh?k(t)ÿhk(t) + ?2modI
 )

 (
 ?2I +

 )
 bk(t)
 (10)
 where ÿ÷Hk represents the modified extended channel matrix for
 user k obtained after taking into account the imperfection in
 CSI. Here we also included the time index parameter. The
 optimal solution for the precoding vector can be given as
 boptk (t) ? maxev
 (ÿ

 ?2I +
 ·
 i6=k

 )
 (11)
 The maxev is used to represent the maximum eigen vector.
 After obtaining the modified channel estimates and the optimal
 precoding vectors, the next step is to precode and schedule the
 MTs. The main goal of this paper is to maximize the network
 capacity based on SLNR precoding and scheduling under
 imperfect CSIT taking into account the quality of service(QoS)
 requirements that each MT demands. The comparative study
 of the deterioration of the network capacity between perfect
 and imperfect CSI is presented in this paper.
 IV. FAIR-SLNR SCHEDULING
 Here in this section we give a brief overview of our previ-
 ously introduced Fair-SLNR scheduling scheme [1]. Fairness
 plays a bigger part of network utility. Greedy algorithm can
 ensure that the total system throughput is maximized while
 individual MTs throughput requirement is overlooked. In real
 MU-MIMO broadcast scenarios, HCC is likely to provide a
 variety of services to different users, each with different QoS
 requirements. In Fair-SLNR based scheduling , the main goal
 of the scheduleder is to maximize the system capacity while
 ensuring that a respectable individual capacity as demanded
 by the user is guaranteed. For supporting such heterogeneous
 throughput fairness among users, a throughput fairness metric
 is defined for user k at time t > 1 as,
 µk(t) = exp
 (
 m
 øCavg(t)? ak cøk(t)
 ? + ak cøk(t)
 )
 (12)
 where, m(m ³ 0) is the throughput slope of the exponential
 function, which determines the sensitivity of the through-
 put fairness curve. Smaller values of m means less strict
throughput fairness among users and typically give them only
 average throughput fairness. Indeed, when m = 0 the weighted
 sum-rate maximization problem reduces to normal sum-rate
 maximisation problem without any fairness consideration. The
 scalar valued ak are constants to allow different throughput
 requirements among users. The variable ? is an appropiate
 small value for ensuring that the denominator is non-zero. The
 value cøk(t) is the moving average of past throughput for user
 k which is updated as,
 cøk(t) = (1? 1
 ?
 )cøk(t? 1) + 1
 ?
 Ck(t? 1) (13)
 where, ? is the smoothing factor, and Ck(t ? 1) is the data
 rate of user k at time t. The scalar øCavg(t) in (12) is defined
 as,
 øC(t) = (1/K)
 K·
 k=1
 cøk(t) (14)
 Any user with ak cøk(t) > øC(t) has a value less than 1 as
 its weight. In this case, that user might be excluded from a
 selected user set for transmission by weighted sum rate max-
 imisation rule for meeting the throughput fairness constraint
 among MTs despite its high channel gain.
 From time-slot two onwards the scheduling algorithm also
 takes in account the throughput fairness metric as described
 by equation (12). So as it is evident from the algorithm
 proposed, for first iteration the algorithm searches to maximize
 the throughput fair largest channel gain of user. Once the first
 MT is chosen in the first iteration, then the algorithm tries
 to include a single MT in every other iteration based on the
 maximisation of the Fair-SLNR criterion. In the calculation
 of Fair-SLNR, only the leakage power to MTs selected in
 the previous iteration is considered and also the throughput
 fairness metric for that user. The throughput fairness metric
 takes the QoS demanded by the user into account. The no. of
 iterations per time slot is equal to the number of transmitting
 antennas at the CAN as stated before. After scheduling, the
 HCC broadcasts data streams of selected users, using leakage-
 based precoding. For the ease of readability the pseudo code
 of the algorithm is also provided in this paper which is
 just a mere abstraction from our previous work [1]. In the
 algorithm, the imperfect CSIT is however taken into account
 and modified accordingly. A comparative study on how Fair-
 SLNR scheduling algorithm fares against the Greedy-SLNR
 and the Random scheduling scheme can be found in our
 previous work [1].
 V. LOWER BOUND ON ACHIEVABLE SUM-RATE
 In this section we provide a lower bound for the achievable
 sum rate of the system per time-slot. If we replace hk of (1) by
 ÿhk as we only have knowledge of modified equivalent channel
 matrices after MMSE estimation, so we can write it as follow,
 rÿk(t) = ÿhk(t)ÿbk(t)xk(t) +
 ÿhk(t)
 ·
 i6=k
 ÿbi(t)xi(t) + wk(t)
 =
 ÿhk(t)uk(t) +·
 i6=k
 ÿhk(t)ui(t) + wk(t) (15)

 end for

 s1(n) = argmaxk? öS(n)µk(n)|ÿhk(n)|2;
 S(n) = S(n)?{s1(n)}; öS(n) = öS(n)? {s1(n)};

 end while

 S(n) = S(n)?{sj+1(n)}; öS(n) = öS(n)? {sj+1(n)};
 end for
 where uk(t) represents the precoded signal that is being
 transmitted. The data rate of MT k ignoring the time-index
 can be given as follow,
 Ratek = I(uk; rÿk) (16)
 Now taking
 ·
 i6=k ÿhkui +wk as the resultant total noise term
 owing to the interference and the desired MTs receiver noise
 and representing it as nk we have,
 rÿk = ÿhkuk + nk (17)
 Thus Ratek can be given as,
 Ratek = Eÿhk log
 (
 1 +
 |ÿhk|2(1/N)
 E[nkn?k|ÿhk]
 )
 ³ E
 ÿhk log
 ( |ÿhk|2(1/N)
 E[nkn?k|ÿhk]
 )
 (18)
 The inequality in equation (18) is because we assume high snr
 regime. We replaced above E[|uk|2] by 1/N . Thus,
 Ratek ³ Eÿhk log
 (|ÿhk|2(1/N))?
 E
 ÿhk log
 (
 E[nkn?k|ÿhk]
 ) (19)
 The inequality in (19) assumes that the resultant noise is
 Gaussian distributed which is the worst case possible noise
 distribution. So replacing the resultant distribution with any
 other distribution will perform better. Applying JensenÕs In-
 equality we have,
Ratek ³ Eÿhk log
 (|ÿhk|2(1/N))? log (E[nkn?k]) (20)
 Thus, Ratek can be expressed as,
 Ratek ³ Eÿhk log
 (|ÿh|2(1/N))? log(?2E[| ÿhk|2]N ? 1N ) (21)
 Thus the sum rate across the the selected users for a time slot
 is
 Sumrate ³
 all selected users·

 log
 (
 ?2E[| ÿhk|2]N ? 1N
 )
 (22)
 VI. CHANNEL ADAPTIVE POWER ALLOCATION
 In our previous work [1], SLNR precoding scheme as-
 sumed that the transmitter distributes equal power to each MT.
 But in the real wireless communication system, the channel
 state of every user is usually different. Thus if the transmit
 power is allocated according to the real CSI, some gains may
 be achieved due to the improved power efficiency. For MU-
 MIMO system, it is believed that the average BER of all users
 is dominated by the worst one. Therefore considering a channel
 adaptive scheme based on the SLNR precoding as proposed
 in [10] can improve the communication quality of the worst
 user by increasing the transmitted power. SLNR is related
 to the real CSI and thus it is used in distributing the power
 adaptively according to the CSI. This we refer to as channel
 adaptive power allocation policy (CAPA). The detailed power
 allocation process is described as follows: The transmitted
 power is allocated according to each userÕs SLNR values. The
 power distributed to each user k is inversely proportional to
 its SLNR value. It can be denoted as,
 pk
 Ptotal
 =
 1/SLNRk·N
 k=1 (1/SLNRk)
 (23)
 where Ptotal is the total transmit power.

 The simulations were performed using MATLAB. The

 equal weight-age to both the immediate past value of data rate
 for MTs as well as the past moving average throughput for
 MTs. The value of ? is chosen to avoid the zero denominator
 case as mentioned earlier. The value of ak is kept at 1 to
 provide equal throughput fairness across all the MTs. As we
 assume that the channels are quasi static time varying , so in
 the simulations we assume that after every 4 time slots the
 channel gains change. We have to schedule 3 MTs after every

 4 time-slots and these MTs transmit their message for those
 time slots. We also assumed that the we have imperfect channel
 knowledge owing to estimation error. The error variance is var-
 ied between 0.10 to 0.20. We run a Monte-Carlo simulation for
 1000 iterations for each scheme and we compare the network
 capacity in bits/sec/Hz for the schemes with respect to per MT
 SNR which is given by 1/?2.In Fig. 3 the network capacity in
 bits/sec/Hz is compared for different values of transmit SNR
 for the cases comparing perfect CSIT with imperfect CSIT.
 We observe a drop of approximately 20 percent in network
 capacity from the perfect CSIT case when comparing against
 imperfect CSIT with ?2e equal to 0.10 at 25dB transmit snr.

 causes the SINR to decrease. Fig. 3 was generated assuming
 that we have EPA policy. However as for reasons mentioned
 earlier in Section 6 we carried out simulations with CAPA
 and compared it against the EPA policy for both imperfect
 and perfect CSIT. As we noticed before the drop in network
 capacity was large for imperfect CSIT case and the gap widens
 marginally more with CAPA. Its pretty natural as we are
 trading network capacity for BER by allocating more power
 to the worst case user. Fig. 4 shows how the network capacity
 varies for the EPA and CAPA policy for both imperfect and
 perfect CSIT and Fig. 5 shows how the average network BER
 varies with the different power allocation policy. We can see
 that there is a significant improvement of average network BER
 at high transmit snr. For BER value of 10?7 the imperfect
 CSIT with CAPA outperforms EPA by 3dB.
 VIII. CONCLUSION
 In this paper, we considered the case of throughput Fair
 SLNR precoding and scheduling with Imperfect CSIT due to
 estimation error. We make a close approximate estimate of the
 perfect CSI from the imperfect channel knowledge by doing
 MMSE modification. We provided a comparative measurement
 showing how much the network capacity suffers owing to
 imperfection in CSIT. We provided a lower bound on the
 achievable sum rate per time slot for the imperfect CSIT case.
 We even show that in case of imperfect CSIT we can opt for
 channel adaptive power allocation. It performs better in terms
 of BER while marginally diminishing network capacity from
 the EPA scheme with imperfect CSIT.
