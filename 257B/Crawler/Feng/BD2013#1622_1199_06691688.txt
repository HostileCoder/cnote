Abstract—Personal data collection is becoming pervasive these 
days, these data has the risk of being abused by current 
application and application marketplace model, because only 
the price of application is explicitly indicated without clear 
agreement on usage of data, and the granularity of data access 
authentication is not enough to protect users privacy. In this 
short paper, we propose a new model of user data privacy. 
Data usage of the application is explicitly shown, and 
controlled by an authentication service, to protect users from 
the abuse of their data, especially in mobile application.   
Keywords-User data privacy, Pay by data; application 
marketplace; mobile privacy. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
There emerged a large amount of applications, especially 
mobile applications, harnessing user-generated data, to 
deliver values to either users or organizations (or both). To 
distribute these applications, all major platforms now provide 
their application marketplaces. Although such model has 
been proven to be easy for user to find and install application, 
and helpful to prosper the application development, there 
still exists some important issues including the one we are 
targeting in this paper: the risk that the application can 
collect the user data without letting users know. This 
problem comes from two aspects: 
Firstly, applications are labeled with their price in money, 
as either free or paid. Actually, lots of applications, which 
labeled “free”, consume valuable user data, and even make 
profit from it. An shown in Figure 1, the application’s 
behavior of collecting users’ data is not explicitly shown, and 
only could be found in the user agreement, which most users 
would not pay attention to. Secondly, even in some 
marketplace, the access of user data by the application is 
indicated, the granularity of data access authentication is not 
enough. For example, as shown in Figure 2, although it 
indicates the application would access the user’s data like 
location, it doesn’t state how much and how frequently it 
would collect such data. [3] had demonstrated that with over 
4 location records, we can precisely identify a user. Such 
example shows that the amount of data matters, while 
collecting a couple of user location records cannot trace the 
user, collecting more data would cause a violation of user 
privacy. There is lack of authentication service to solve this 
problem. In popular authentication protocol like OAuth, only 
the scope and period of user data access are set.

These two problems drive the work in this paper. We try 
to design a new pay-by-data model in which the usage of 
user-generated data are explicitly indicated, and the access to 
user’s data is controlled by new authentication service which 
supports more detailed granularity.  
 
II. RELATED WORK 
As the user data collection becomes more pervasive, the 
privacy issue gets more attention recently. A study from the 
University of California in Santa Barbara [4] concluded that

among 825 examined apps for the iPhone and its operating 
system iOS, 21 percent forward the ID number, four percent 
the current location, and 0.5 percent even copy the address 
book. Last year, Facebook, Apple, Twitter, Yelp and 14 
other companies have been hit with a lawsuit accusing them 
of distributing privacy-invading mobile applications [5]. And 
people have heard lots of new about applications abusing 
users privacy. For example, in February 2012, Path, a mobile 
social networking service, was widely criticized for 
uploading contacts from iPhone users without permission [6], 
and in February 2013, the company was fined $800,000 by 
the FTC for storing data from underage users and will be 
required to have its privacy policies assessed every two years 
for the next 20 years [7].  
Facing this issue, some research has been done on 
investigating and enhancing the privacy mechanism, 
especially that on mobile and user location privacy. [8] 
surveyed the privacy issues in location-aware mobile devices. 
[9] presented an experimental case study that examined 
people's concern for location privacy and compared the 
result to the use of location-based services. [10] tried  to 
understand users’ attitudes and behaviors towards privacy as 
they interact with mobile applications, and to explore 
technologies that empower users to more effectively and 
efficiently specify their privacy preferences. [11] 
investigated the privacy issue in mobile photo sharing.  [12] 
proposed an anonymization model to ease the issue of 
location privacy. [13] discussed the context for mobile 
privacy through an empirical study of mobile social 
networking.  
 
III. SYSTEM 
In this section, we presented our design of pay-by-data 
model and its system implementation. The work has four 
different components: data collection service, data pricing 
agreement, authentication service, and interface to 
application and application marketplace. The overall 
architecture is shown in Figure 3, the data collection 
component provides an infrastructure where user can store 
and manage their data in a secure manner. User can view and 
control all their data, instead of distribute the data in various 
applications. The data pricing enables the agreement 
between application and user on how user-generated data 
would be consumed by the application. The application 
developer provides the data price while submitting the 
application to the marketplace. When a user purchases the 
application, the data price is explicitly shown. Once the 
agreement is made, the access to the data is controlled by the 
authentication service; only serving data within the scope 
and amount in the data pricing agreement. Interface to 
application and application marketplace provides a way for 
current application and marketplace to integrate with pay-by-
 data model.  We would now present these four components 
in detail. 
 
Figure 3.  Architecture of Pay-by-data model 
 
A. Data Collection Service 
The data collection service is built upon WikiSensing 
platform, a sensor data repository developed by us. Its design 
is suitable to store and manage user-generated data on a 
large-scale. The architecture of it is shown in Figure 4. For 
each type of user data, user registers a data source for it, and 
can send and retrieve the data in real time. These data are 
encrypted and secure accessed in WikiSensing. The storage 
layer is built upon based on mongoDB1 cluster, and it has 
good performance on scalability. All the data are stored in 
mongoDB as Json documents without fixed schema. Such 
schema-less storage architecture decouples the storage layer 
from the data schema, enabling storage layer flexibility.  
To support data management, the data collection 
component provides ontology support, thus all the data are 
described by an ontology schema. We adopted a hierarchical 
category for all the ontology in the system. So the users data 
could be categorized in namespace like “location”, “social 
network”, etc. Such data structure offers the capability of 
ontology-based querying over the data, as well as the 
hierarchical granularity for data access.  
Some other functions include the user management, 
which can be integrated with OpenID service, Web interface 
for data management, etc.

The functionalities of data collection service are accessed 
through authenticated Web services. Figure 5 and 6 shows 
the Restful Web Service (http and https) for user to register a 
data source and submit data to it.

Figure 6.  API to submit data 
With this component, user can view and manage all their 
data sources and data in a centralized and secure manner. 
Figure 7 shows the Web interface where user can get the 
visualized and geo-indexed data created by them.  
 
Figure 7.  Visualization of user data 
 
With such data collection and management service, the 
user-generated data are moved from multiple applications 
without user control, to a centric, independent and user fully 
controlled place. And we need to mention that, such data 
collection component is replaceable, users are able to choose 
any appropriate data storage services to achieve similar 
functions.  
 
B. Data Pricing Agreement 
We define a new type of price for applications, which is 
the data. As data is valuable for user and application, they 
could act as a kind of currency, that user pays they for utility 
gain from the application, as shown in Figure 8. For example, 
in a crowdsourcing navigation application, users created 
traffic data is valuable for application to get the overall 
traffic level, and application’s utility to smart navigation is 
desired for users. In such case, users can make agreement 
with the application, to buy the utility of navigation, by 
paying their travel data. 
 
Figure 8.  From pay by money to pay by data 
 
The price of data is defined as an agreement of data 
usage, with the elements listed in Table 1.  
55
TABLE I.  ELEMENT IN DATA PRICING AGREEMENT 
Element Description 
app_id 
The identification of application (namespace of 
marketplace + application identification in the 
marketplace). 
url The url that has the description of the application. 
scope 
The set of scopes where the application consumes 
the user-generated data, each scope is defined by the 
data category in data collection service. 
frequency 
The allowed frequency of data access for the 
application. 
amount The maximum amount of data (the number of data records) accessible for the application. 
valid_time The valid time for application to access the data 
operation The permitted operation on the data by the application, such as read, insert, and update. 
 
When an application is submitted to the application 
marketplace, the agreement of data usage is also submitted. 
Here is an example of such agreement, in the format of Json: 
{ 
“app_id”: “ios.1154431”, 
“url”: “http://wikisensing.org/client/appexample”, 
“scope”:[“precise-location”], 
“frequency”: 21600000, 
“amount”: 10, 
“valid_time”: 684000000, 
“operation”: “read_only” 
} 
This agreement indicates that an application from iOS 
apple store would read users’ location data at most 4 times a 
day, within 10 days, and it can only get 10 location records 
totally. Such data agreement would be explicitly shown in 
the marketplace, as shown in the case study section. 
If user agrees with it, he can confirm to purchase the 
application, and the agreement is sent to authentication 
service for access control. 
 
C. Authentication Service 
The authentication service acts as a gateway to control 
the application access to user’s data in data collection service 
during the runtime. 
The authentication service extends the specification of 
OAuth 2.0, with additional request parameters of elements 
including frequency and amount mentioned before. The 
authentication server is built with oauthlib2.  
Figure 9 shows the interaction between user, application, 
authentication service, and data collection service. 
                                                             
2 oauthlib: https://github.com/idan/oauthlib 
Figure 9.  Interaction for authentication 
 
Figure 10 shows the sequential diagram for a data access 
by the application if the request is allowed by data pricing 
agreement: 
 
Figure 10.  Sequential diagram for sucessful data access 
 
 
Figure 11.  Sequential diagram for illegal data access 
 
When the access of data is out of data pricing agreement, 
the data access would be blocked as shown in Figure 11, 
with error message sent to the application: 
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request 
Warning: 299 ServiceName "Data agreement error: 
access is not allowed with associated data agreement."

D. Interface to Application and Marketplace 
We provided the interface for both application and 
marketplace to adopt the pay-by-data system, as shown in 
Figure 12.  
For application, the interfaces are provided as a set of 
Web services for the following functions: 
• Getting the data through the authentication service. 
• Getting the anonymized identification of user. 
• Sending message to data collection service, if user 
doesn’t have enough data required. 
For marketplace, the interfaces provides following 
functionalities: 
• Sending user notification about change of data 
pricing agreement, and asking user to accept or 
decline it.  
• Getting user’s available categories of data sources. 
The application developer don’t need to install new SDK 
to enable pay-by-data model, but just change their methods 
like getting data to interacting with above Web services.  
 
Figure 12.  Interface to application and marketplace 
 
To facilitate the development of application based on 
these interfaces, we also provide an online workflow editor 
“AppEditor”  which encapsulates these interfaces as the 
workflow elements, as shown in Figure 13: 
 
Figure 13.  AppEditor 
 
For the application marketplace, more efforts are 
required to adopt pay-by-data model: it should provide a new 
interface for developers to submit their data pricing 
agreement, and a repository to store them. New user 
interface for users to view the agreement, and purchase it are 
also required.  
 
 
IV. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we presented our work on enhancing data 
privacy for user in pervasive data collection era, by 
proposing a pay-by-data model and system, where the data 
price is explicitly shown and authentication has more 
detailed granularity. We showed the design and 
implementation of four core components in the system. We 
believe our work provides a new approach to protect users’ 
privacy, especially while for the application from application 
marketplace.
