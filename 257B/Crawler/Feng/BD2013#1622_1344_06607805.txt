Abstract 
 
With emerging computing trends of social, mobile, cloud and big data, and also with the new trend 
of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) in companies, enterprise computing is recently going through 
transformational changes. This talk will start by looking at the recent computing trends, one by one, 
and their implication on the enterprise computing, individually and collectively. While the trends 
started mostly for consumer computing, they ultimately have a significant impact on enterprise 
computing. It is expected that they will transform how information and communication 
technologies are used in enterprises, and so that they will fundamentally and permanently change the 
nature of the business of enterprise computing. We will look at a number of recent example 
products and services for enterprising computing built on the emerging computing trends and 
catering their needs, in an effort to take a peek at where enterprise computing is going in the future. 
Based on this observation, we will discuss the challenges and opportunities in the future of 
enterprise computing.
