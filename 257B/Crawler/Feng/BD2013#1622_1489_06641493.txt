 EXTENDED ABSTRACT
 Abstract—Online Social Networks (OSNs) tipically exploit
 logically centralized infrastructure. The centralized nature of
 OSNs has several drawbacks including scalability, privacy, and
 dependence on a provider. Specifically, OSN privacy has become a
 major concern, particularly privacy and protection from massive
 data-mining and big-brotherly treatment of the users by the social
 networking service providers. In contrast to centralized OSNs, a
 distributed online social network helps to lower the cost of the
 provider drastically, and allows better control of user privacy.
 This has several consequences: in terms of privacy, no central
 data collection, nor any central entity that decides or changes
 the terms of service. In this paper we focus on the definition
 of P2P Distributed Online Social Network (DOSN) paradigm
 and propose a new approach to P2P DOSN based on Dunbar’s
 number, which bounds the number of people one knows and
 keeps social contacts with.
 Keywords—P2P, DOSN, social network analysis, caching.
 I. INTRODUCTION
 Online Social Networks (OSNs) have become a common
 ground where people are generating and consuming huge
 amount of information. There has been a large growth in the
 number of providers of such OSNs and user’s data are scat-
 tered over them. The currently popular OSNs are centralized
 which means they are based on centralized servers storing
 all the information. In this way, users have less control over
 their own data and their data is scattered over the internet
 in different OSN providers which usually do not support data
 interoperability. Centralized social networking services present
 several problems that include both technical and social issues
 that emerge as a consequence of a centralized management of
 the services. On the technical side, the centralized management
 of a social network with rapid growth in user popularity has
 led to various performance scalability issues. Along with the
 increasing popularity of the services comes the increasing cost
 of managing and maintaining the infrastructures to ensure
 a smooth continuation and reasonable performance of the
 provided services. On the social side, the fast growth of the
 networking sites, without proper privacy preserving schemes,
 leads to a collapse in social context, for instance, the user’s
 information are shared by too many unwanted contacts. The
 rupture of trust between the users and the site providers were
 also among the key problems leading to the collapse of such
 early social networking services.
 A current trend for developing online social network services
 is towards the decentralization of the OSN infrastructure. In
 the last years, the P2P environment has been proposed as
 support for Online Social Network. The inherent nature of
 how people connect with each other in a social network makes
 P2P architectures suitable for building distributed OSNs. A
 distributed online social network (DOSN) [1] is an online
 social network implemented on a distributed information
 management platform, such as a network of trusted servers,
 P2P systems or an opportunistic network. By decentralizing
 OSNs, the concept of a service provider is changed, as there
 is no single provider but a set of peers that take on and
 share the tasks needed to run the system. This has several
 consequences: in terms of privacy and operation, no central
 entity that decides or changes the terms of service exists.
 Moving from a centralized web service to a decentralized
 system also means that different modes of operations be-
 come possible: using one’s own storage or cloud storage,
 delay-tolerant social networks, and local treatment of local
 content, to name some of them. Decentralizing the existing
 functionalities of online social networks requires finding ways
 for providing robustness against churn, distributing storage
 of data, propagating updates, defining an overlay topology
 and a protocol enabling searching and addressing, etc. The
 problem of dynamism is related to two types of dynamism:
 978-1-4799-0838-7/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 678
social and infrastructure dynamism. The social dynamism is
 present in social relationships due to the variation of relations
 between users and of the number of users of the DOSN. The
 infrastructure dynamism is related to the underlying overlay
 network. Nodes may join/leave the underlying network, so that
 the corresponding user has a state that indicates its availability
 (online/offline). Moreover, a social graph used to model OSNs
 can be very large. Mapping a social graph onto a distributed
 network can be very expensive due to the number of social
 links for each node, so the cost of mirroring the social network
 links into distributed network links can be prohibitively high.
 And it can be very inefficient, because as discussed previously,
 most of the social links are inactive (two friends who rarely
 interact online). Another important requirement is related to
 the data availability and the information diffusion. Data should
 be stored at some nodes to be always available. The main
 question is about where data should be stored, for instance
 exclusively at nodes run by friends, or at random nodes, or
 at particular nodes that provide a Social Cache mechanism
 [2]. Nodes should be connected according to their social
 connections in order to cluster friends in the overlay network.
 This should facilitate operations as information diffusion or
 data storage and each update or profile from one user must
 be diffused to all its social connections. Another requirement
 is related to how a user can find its friends in the P2P
 overlay, and how can they discover new friends by virtue of
 common interests. Over multiple sessions, peers may change
 their physical address. However friends and trust links of a
 social network are essential, and so it is crucial both to be
 able to find back friends even if they have changed their
 physical address, and also to authenticate the identity. From the
 security perspective, keeping control over own data implies the
 need for security support, so that the classical requirements for
 security should be refined to consider the context of DOSN.
 We propose a new approach for Distributed Online Social
 Networks based on the Dunbar’s number in which we study
 and evaluate all the problems inherent to the decentralization.
 We consider an underlying system including also mobile P2P
 connections to take advantage of geographic proximity and its
 correlation with the interests of the users.
 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section II
 presents related works on Distributed Online Social Networks.
 While section III describes in detail our approach.
 II. RELATED WORK
 Several projects such as Diaspora [3], LifeSocial.KOM [4],
 PeerSon [5], Safebook [6], and Supernova [7] have addressed
 privacy in OSNs either through cryptography, architectural
 modifications and decentralization. Most of the proposed
 projects exploit a DHT based architecture. Diaspora is a really
 used social network in which users’ profiles are hosted on
 servers that are administrated by individual users, without
 support for encryption. LifeSocial.KOM [4] is a P2P plat-
 form for secure online social networks which provides the
 functionality of common online social networks in a totally
 distributed and secure manner. LifeSocial is designed to create
 a modular plugin-architecture to assure extensibility and the
 plugins are hosted on a general platform for P2P application.
 PeerSoN [5] is a distributed infrastructure for social networks
 that provides encryption and direct data exchange. PeerSoN
 has a two-tier architecture, where one tier serves as a look-
 up service and the second tier consists of peers and contains
 user data, such as user profiles. This approach pays attention to
 security and privacy concerns. Safebook is a decentralized and
 privacy preserving online social network which is composed
 of three major different components, the TIS (Trusted Identi-
 fication Service), Matryoshkas which are specialized overlays
 encompassing each user, and a P2P location substrate based
 on Kademlia. In [7], a recent approach based on a Super-Peer
 architecture is shown. The system uses Super-Peers, which are
 nodes with a higher degree of bandwidth, storage space and
 higher availability, to manage DOSNs.
 III. OUR PROPOSAL
 A. A new approach for DOSNs
 The evaluation of the interactions between friends in cen-
 tralized social networks shows that they may have different
 characteristics. This confirms an observation made by Dunbar
 [8] on offline social networks. The Dunbar’s number [9] is
 a suggested cognitive limit to the number of people with
 whom one can maintain stable social relationships. These are
 relationships in which an individual knows who each person is,
 and how each person relates to every other person. Authors
 assert that numbers larger than this generally require more
 restrictive rules, laws, and enforced norms to maintain a stable,
 cohesive group. The Dunbar’s number defines the number
 of people one knows and keeps social contact with, and it
 does not include the number of people known personally
 with a conclused social relationship, nor people just generally
 known with a lack of persistent social relationship, a number
 which might be much higher and which depends on long-
 term memory size. Dunbar introduces also the concept of ego
 network [8] as a social network built on a user (ego) and
 composed by the user and its social relationships with other
 users (alters). Ego networks are an important subject of in-
 vestigation in anthropology, as several fundamental properties
 of social relationships can be characterized by studying them.
 In particular, it has been shown that in (offline) ego networks
 there are a series of circles of alters arranged in a hierarchical
 inclusive sequence based on an increasing level of intimacy
 [10].
 Dunbar et al. identify four layers [10]: ”support clique”,
 ”sympathy group”, ”affinity group” and ”active network” with
 the average size of 5, 12, 35, 150 respectively (figure 1). The
 support clique includes alters with a very strong relationship
 with the ego. Each subset includes all the relationships of the
 previous circles along with an additional set of social links
 with a weaker level of intimacy. The last set contains simple
 acquaintances, with a relatively weak relationship with the ego.

Figure 1. The Dunbar Circles.
 The scaling factor of the size of the ego network is almost
 constant, and very close to three. Ego networks alone cannot
 provide a complete representation of human social networks.
 Indeed they do not capture the mutual relationships between
 the alters or, in other words, the correlation between different
 ego networks. This gap can be filled by connecting ego net-
 works together in order to form a complete social network. A
 complete representation of social network taking into account
 Dunbar relationship is shown in [11]. Recently, [12] has
 empirically verified the presence of Dunbar’s number in OSN
 like Facebook. The authors analyse a data set containing more
 than 23 million social interactions in Facebook. They extract
 the frequency of contacts from the ego networks in the data
 set. Then, they apply different clustering techniques on the
 distributions of the frequency of contacts of the different ego
 networks. The typical number of circles in the structure of a
 virtual ego networks is, on average, equal to 4 and the average
 scaling factor between the concentric circles of the social
 structure is close to 3, as found in offline social networks.
 To model the strength of contacts self-defined by the user,
 we must refine the graph modelling the social relations and we
 call this graph the interaction graph. In this case the network is
 modelled by a direct and weighted graph G = (V;E), where V
 is the set of the users and E is the set of the social interactions
 between the users. Each link has a weight pi;j , which is the
 effective relevance of the interaction between i and j.
 B. Our proposal
 The main challenge of our proposal is to define a P2P
 network where the overlay is based on the interaction graph
 previously described. With a Dunbar-based P2P network, each
 node has a view which contains its neighborhood and the link
 with each neighbor is weighted by the relation’s weight. We
 have investigated how the Dunbar-based approach may help
 us to resolve the main problems of a DOSN.
  Topology, Scalability. In our P2P network each node has
 an own ego network. The union of the ego networks of
 all nodes composes the entire P2P Dunbar-based overlay.
 In detail, each node has a multi-circles topology in which
 each circle contains a subset of the node’s view in respect
 to the weight of the relation, as shown in figure 1. The
 limitation in the number of nodes cointained in the view
 permit us to deal with the network scalability.
  Dinamicity, Data Availability/Persistency, As far as con-
 cerns social dynamism, we need some mechanisms to
 evaluate the interactions of the users to understand pos-
 sible variations of the weight of a relation between an
 ego and alters. Our final goal is to define distributed al-
 gorithms to analyze the variations in term of interactions
 weight and so, to change the network structure. As far
 as concerns the infrastructure dynamism, the problem
 is related to the persistency of data of a single user
 when the corresponding node leaves the network. An
 interesting mechanism, discussed in section I, is that
 of Social Cache [2]. A social cache permits to save
 information about users as user profiles or updates, when
 a user decides to go offline, and to alleviate the node-
 to-node traffic of a DOSN. With particular techniques,
 that include the trustworthiness and the security related
 to the connections with these social caches, users choose
 some friends as Social Caches. Our goal is also to exploit
 proper distributed algorithms for balancing load of social
 caches.
  Search, Addressing and Updates diffusion. Focusing on
 a single node, known as ego, and considering a single
 ego network, the information must be diffused through
 the neighborhood organized into circles, as discussed
 previosly. The neighborhood is also characterized by a
 different importance due to the number of interactions
 about the ego and alters. In particular, an information
 or update is more important for the inner circle than
 the others. Information diffusion protocols must choose
 peers according to the importance of the interaction (the
 weight of a link). This solution is justified as discussed in
 the section III-A (Dunbar’s circles). It has been recently
 shown that people characterized by a high degree of
 interaction are also characterized by shared interests. Be-
 cause of this, in our approach, a Dunbar-based structure
 is exploited for retrieving information interesting for the
 user.
  Security. The underlying network permit us to manage
 trusted connections. In fact, each node is owner of its
 data, but replication of them on other nodes implies a
 trusted mechanism. Using the Dunbar-based overlay, we
 know the weight of the interactions and so, the weight
 of the trustness between two peers.
  Physical Locality. When considering mobile opportunis-
 tic networks, further forms of information diffusion may
 be investigated. Using mobile phones, we can keep track
 of how many times a user has met another one, and the
 duration of the contact. Also, when the nodes are mobile
 devices, moving in the physical environment, they may
 come into contact with other mobile devices. Assuming
 that each peer knows the interests of its neighbors, the
 module can ensure that the peers can retrieve useful in-
 formation for themselves and for their neighbors and can
 exchange them within the DOSNs or opportunistically in
 680
case of contact between two devices.
 IV. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
 We have proposed a Dunbar-based P2P Network to resolve
 the main problems of a DOSN. We have studied real datasets
 which show that a Dunbar-based structure is present in popular
 Online Social Networks like Facebook and Twitter. This study
 is our first step towards understanding how to organize the P2P
 overlay structure. We are investigating a distributed algorithm
 to compute the betweenness centrality which will be used to
 define social caching strategies in our approach.
