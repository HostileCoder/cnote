 Abstract—In our previous work, we have intro-
 duced various service value broker (SVB) patterns
 which integrate business modeling, knowledge man-
 agement and economic analysis. In this paper, work-
 ing towards the target of maximizing the potential
 usage of available resource to achieve the optimization
 of the satisfaction on both the service provider side
 and the service consumer side under the guidance
 of the public administrative, we propose to build
 the E-Tourism platform based on SVB. This pa-
 per demonstrates the mechanism for SVB based E-
 Tourism framework. The advantages of employing
 SVB include that the SVB can help to increase the
 value added in a realtime and balanced manner which
 conforms to the economical goal of both long run and
 short run. An experiment is shown using a personnel
 recommendation system.

 I. Introduction
 A. The service value broker
 Software design patterns [15] have been proved pro-
 posed and verified successfully in the modeling processes
 of multiple technical domains. However for modeling
 for modeling service oriented computing (SOC) applica-
 tions, design patterns have to be adapted according to
 value of Quality of Service (QoS) or business contractual
 aspects. We refer to this as the Service Value Broker
 (SVB) pattern [9]. SVB has already been proposed
 for cloud service brokerage [22] which we foresee as an
 important characteristics of the optimization of the E-
 Service composition of [16] E-Service Economics. The
 related definitions are as follows [9]:
 • Service Value Broker (SVB): driven by a value
 based goal, when a direct service composition can-
 not meet some required constraints from the service
 contract [7] or service level agreement(SLA) such
 as response time, location, license area, available
 period, currency format. If the introduction of a in-
 termediate service can help to solve these problems
 and enable a service composition to be qualified, the
 introduced intermediate service is a SVB.
 • Direct Service Value Broker (DSVB): direct SVB is
 a special type of SVB resulting from a composition
 of services. This composition must bring more value
 to the stakeholder who introduces the DSVB. By
 value we mean not only monetary value but also
 non-monetary such as reputation and brand value,
 etc.
 From the perspective of value analysis, a simplified
 formulation of the difference between constructing a
 traditional broker and a SVB is as follows:
 1) Quality driven - For constructing a traditional
 broker, a composing service is chosen based on the
 order of the quality of its functionality. And for a
 set of composing services, the priority is in ratio
 to:
 ∑
 integration (quality)i...n .
 2) Price/quality driven - For constructing a SVB, a
 composing service is chosen based on the order of
 the price/quality of its functionality. And for a set
 of composing services, the priority is in ratio to:∑
 integration (price/quality)i...n +valueadded.
 B. Building E-Tourism on the brokerage
 To cope with the challenges of E-Tourism systems
 such as multiple sources of data processing, high di-
 mension of database, large linked data, huge amount
 of sensor data collection, and realtime response, etc,
 we propose to alleviate the problem solving from a
 knowledge management perspective in combination with
 a SVB based framework. SVB directly centers service
 value implementation and service value optimization. We
 have collected demonstrative SVB in [11]. In this paper,
 we propose to use SVB as the base to integrate three
 important sides of a service ecosystem: service provider,
 service customer and public administration [6]. Each of
 these three sides maintains an independent interest or
 value system and at the same time relates to others
 as an element of an global value calculation system.
 SVB is expected to function as an important source
 of value added for optimizing the whole system under
 the comprehensive evaluation/measure in terms of value.

The expected contributions of this architecture include
 the follows:
 • Enhanced knowledge management granularity -
 From knowledge management perspective, SVB
 based architecture will leverage the abstraction level
 of the knowledge decomposition since problem de-
 scription can be decomposed or mapped to knowl-
 edge pieces represented by various SVB elements
 above the data map stage in a MapReduce frame-
 work [29], and the result can be integrated as a
 general solution through the SVB based knowledge
 pieces above the level of data level of the reducing
 stage of a MapReduce implementation as well.
 • Value added focused - SVB is designed to bridge
 the barrel of both functional and QoS sides in both
 individual service select and service composition to
 reach a measurable value increase. Under a well
 managed knowledge management implementation,
 a balanced result in terms of the comprehensive
 value can be fairly expected.
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows: SectionII
 presents background knowledge and the general scenario.
 Section III presents the analysis of the sources of value
 added brought by introducing SVB and the comprehen-
 sive analysis. Section IV presents an experiment on a
 personnel recommendation system. This is followed by
 related work in Section V and conclusions with future
 directions in Section VI.
 II. The background and scenario
 A. Demonstration of E-tourism related SVB
 Here we demonstrate some SVB and DSVB [11] which
 compose an E-Tourism system. We assume the exis-
 tence of E-Contracts among stakeholder. We denote the
 contract on the source end of an exchange as CS, the
 contract on the target end of an exchange as CT, the
 input of SVB/DSVB contract as iSVB and the output
 of a SVB/DSVB contract as oSVB.
 1) Weather forecasting (WF ? DB): weather fore-
 cast is a costly and challenging task, however a
 lot of organizations might need this service with
 specific precision request.
 Target : WF |CS < W F |CT
 SV S = (0, ?(WF |CT , W F |CS))
 weather forecasting broker : by subcontracting the
 weather forecasting to a professional service, it
 actually implement a reuse of resources including
 professional knowledge, etc. Similarly we can iden-
 tify numerous application level brokers such as:
 vender broker, data cleaning broker, etc.
 Solution: WF (task)|CS ? W F (task)|SV B
 2) Operation security:(OS ? DS) the completeness
 and reliability of a series of operations and
 behaviors of a service transaction is defined as
 operation security.
 Operation security broker : a service which checks
 the atomic actions and monitors implementation
 of the sequence of execution or protocol of
 interactions can play the broker.
 Solution: (OS|CS ?
 check(atomic)|iSV B)AND(OS|CT ?
 monitor(protocol)|oSV B))
 3) Information privacy:(IP ? DS) during a
 transaction, some pieces of information which are
 not required or are not necessary for a transaction
 might be required or leaked without notice.
 Information privacy broker : a service which checks
 and restricts the usages of service information
 based on a necessary-only policy may play the
 broker.
 Solution: (IP |CS ?
 (check(access)|iSV BANDvalidate(necessary)|iSV B))
 B. Composition of SVB
 There are various situations where SVBs are composed
 with different cardinalities of ”1:1”, ”1:n”, ”m:n”, and
 sequences. We classify the composition modes as follows:
 1) Vertical composition: We take the Location
 broker as an example.If requests are restricted to
 be ”from China” while the customer want to visit
 ”as much nations of Europe Union as possible”
 without additional registration. Then a solution
 can be built on the integration of Location broker
 which takes request ”from China” while has the
 authority to issue the pass for only one nation.
 Solution: (LC|CS =
 {LC|iSV B}1...n)AND({LC|oSV B}1...n =
 LC|CT )AND(∑(coverage(LC)|oSV B) =
 coverage|CT )
 2) Horizontal composition: We take the Currency
 broker as an example. The payment is restricted
 to be ”Czech Koruna” while the customer has
 only ”Thai Baht”. If a Currency exchange broker
 (a) which exchange ”Thai Baht” to ”Euro”, and
 a Currency exchange broker (b) which exchange
 ”Euro” to ”Czech Koruna” are available. The
 connection of the two brokers will construct a
 solution from this customer to the provider.
 Solution: (CE|CS =
 CE|iSV B(a))AND(CE|oSV B(a) =
 CE|iSV B(b))AND(CE|oSV B(b) = CE|CT )
 3) Intelligent composition: For an agent SVB [23],
 to increase its general profit for providers it will
 consider the provider side situation such as the
 real time sales data and yearly historical sales
 record at different seasons. After a comprehensive
 calculation, it will offer probably a discount strat-
 18
Figure 1. The SVB based processing
 egy or advertisement plan, such as a case that
 if a customer can purchase several services as a
 bundle, there will be a 30percent discount which
 will be mutual beneficial to both customers and
 the provider. Also at customer side, if negotiation
 is permitted among customers, they can form Ser-
 vice federations to jointly collect and build their
 purchase items into service bundles to benefit from
 the discount offer from the provider side.
 Figure 1 shows the state diagram of a E-Service in
 a SVB composition process. A traditional process is
 embedded as a comparison. During a traditional process,
 a service is firstly discovered and then it will go through
 a sequential process of ” matchmaking ? selection ?
 composition”. The result is a local solution which does
 not fully take advantage of the potential of the flexibility
 of E-Services in a scalable cloud environment. When
 the business value is given the highest priority, the
 subcontracting relationship implemented by SVB could
 bring potentially higher value. SVB based solution can
 fully explore the potential of the available resources, for
 the processing only when one of the conditions of: (a)
 the assigned search time is finished, (b) the cost reaches
 limit, and (c) all possible subcontract scenarios have
 been explored, has been met, the search will end. The
 result will be a global best value in terms of business
 gains on all parties.
 C. The general business scenario
 Figure 2 shows the general scenario of multiple service
 values from mainly three sources. We summarize them
 as follows:
 1) Provider value (PRV) - At service provider side,
 business value need to be considered from the tem-
 poral dimension as short run vs. long run target
 which will decide specific business strategies such
 as new product advertisement, promotion, sell out,
 etc. Among providers the value can be classified
 into two categories:
 • Negative competitive cost - Negative competi-
 tive cost occurs when other business competi-
 tors who offer similar services bid for the same
 order or market.
 • Positive cooperative wins - When service ven-
 dors who offer related or similar services agree
 on some fixed conditions such as market share,
 sells area, etc, they can build some cooper-
 ations to profit from the customer side such
 as lifting the price of services or charges of
 maintenance, etc.
 2) Customer value (CSV) - Service customers in gen-
 eral have independent views on the value of the
 targeted services. However customers can socialize
 with other customers to query the quality of a
 service from others’ experiences and comments.
 The experience information or news/advertisment
 propagated through social media among customers
 is playing an increasing role in promoting sales
 and adjusting commerce behavior. Customers can
 also build federations to protect their shared in-
 terests against malicious service providers with
 shared cost. Small scale of customer cooperation
 can cooperate to win promotion sale packages from
 providers in a win-win manner.
 3) Public value (PUV) - The public administration
 is the third party which can play the juridical
 role for solving the argumentation. The public ad-
 ministration also has other critical responsibilities:
 (i) monitor the service market through economical
 analysis to avoid the competition between the
 provider and customer side to enter an Zero-Sum
 game; (ii) employ public policies to intervene the
 strong cooperation against customer interests at
 the provider side, or collusive customers [28], etc.
 These different sources of values are weaved together
 in a business transaction. Using E-contract of services
 as the media, the work flow can be described as fol-
 lows. Firstly on the service provider side, PRV will be
 arranged to document the content and SLA of to be pro-
 vided E-Services in the form of E-Contracts. Secondarily
 customers will find and do matchmaking of the available
 E-Contracts of available E-Services. During this stage,
 SVB can be introduced to enlarge the scope of the choice
 space on the customer side while increasing the chances
 on the provider side[10]. The key factor of the SVB
 19
Figure 2. Integrating value considerations from multiple stakeholder with value brokerage
 practice lies in making full use of the available/assigned
 computational resource from the customer side and the
 permitted sub-contract relationship to explore an opti-
 mal [9] result in terms of value measure.
 D. Domain knowledge based classification of SVB
 From the domain of E-Tourism, we have identified
 many application areas which can be implemented with
 SVB in different categories[11] which is shown in Figure
 3.
 • Information category - Related brokers include the
 translation broker[11] which deals with the language
 mismatching situations in multiple language infor-
 mation query, multiple language route planning, etc,
 the information broker [11] which provides optimal
 choices to customers for hotel reservation, flight
 booking, car renting, local weather forecast, traf-
 fic control, daily care, etc, and the proxy broker
 [11] which technically supports fixing mismatching
 situations such as location mismatching, time mis-
 matching, and IP mismatching, etc.
 • Data category - Related brokers include the format
 broker [11] which integrates the data or file format
 for channeling the information flow among various
 institutes and organizations, and provides realtime
 currency exchange [11] for payment calculation,
 etc, and the data QoS broker which deals with
 mismatching situations of the usage policy of data,
 privacy of data, copyright of data based usually on
 the data contract [26].
 • Operational category - Related brokers include the
 operation broker which deals with price faulting,
 disaster rescue optimization, food safety surveil-
 lance, restaurant sanitary monitoring, medical care
 resource optimization, insurance recommendation,
 etc, and the service QoS broker which helps to cater
 the mismatching situations of availability, latency,
 and throughput restrictions [11], etc.
 • Intelligent implementation category - Related bro-
 kers include the optimization broker which deals
 with the compositional issues of service competition
 and service federation [11] under related value tar-
 gets. Optimization surpasses the scope of individual
 services which focuses on specific functionalities or
 quality properties, and the business broker which
 deals with the judical issue of service compensa-
 tion, trust infrastructure, and reputation brokerage
 malpractice, security brokerage, local public policy
 enforcement, global business value calculation and
 balancing, and personalization based on Big data
 analysis, etc.
 III. The analysis on value added
 A. Sources of value added
 Building an E-Tourism architecture on top of SVB
 are expected to have several possible advantages if well
 managed including the following basic situations:
 • Added value of PRV - On the provider side, SVB
 can bring more business chances through relating
 otherwise not related business together such as
 creating an international language translation plat-
 form which can redistribute translation request to
 individual translation service providers. The added
 20
Figure 3. E-Tourism related SVB classified from a knowledge management perspective
 value PRV on a specific provider XP can be calcu-
 lated as the multiplying of the increased amount of
 request req with the difference of the price price:
 PRV (XP ) =req ? price
 The cost on the broker provider XPSV B can be as-
 sumed to be balanced to simply the calculation here
 for demonstration purpose. But in real situation,
 there can be added value on XPSV B through reuse
 of information and operation, etc [8].
 • Added value of CSV - On the customer side, SVB
 can bring more opportunities through sub-contract
 [9] relationships for customers to find expected ser-
 vices with the highest comprehensive value. The
 added value CSV on a specific customer XC side
 can be calculated as the sum of the gains from the
 saved cost on service payment pay , the increased
 satisfaction sat and the cost for extra searching
 cos :
 CSV (XC) =pay + sat + cos
 • Added value of PUV - On the public administrative
 side, SVB can be utilized for several important
 purposes which include the follows:
 – Added value of PUVcompetition- play the judical
 role which can lower the cost of market ad-
 justment in comparison with the free market
 situation where Zero-Sum game can hurt the
 gain of both CSV and PRV. The gains can be
 calculated as:
 competition= ?avoid(loss(PRV )) ?
 cost(interfere(PUV )).
 – Added value of P UVcooperation- SVB can also
 be used to interfere the forming of a dominat-
 ing side in the provider side through collusive
 cooperation which will hurt the regular compe-
 tition and the gain of CSV. The gains can be
 calculated as:
 cooperation= ?avoid(malpractice) ?
 cost(tradeoff(P UV )).
 – Added value of P UVsecurity- SVB can be em-
 ployed to provide public qualified third party
 security services which will save the total
 spends from the individual cooperations. The
 gains can be calculated as:
 security= ?increaseefficency(individual) ?
 cost(security(P UV )).
 – Added value of PUVBigData- SVB can be em-
 ployed by the public administration to evaluate
 the technological innovations such as Big Data
 processing for both personalization and public
 intelligence, and harness their implementation
 to avoid their malpractice in terms of both
 business value and social effect. The gains can
 be calculated as:
 BigData= ?avoid(malpractice) ?
 cost(tradeoff(P UV )).
 The general added value brought from public side
 can be calculated as:
 PUV = ? competition +? cooperation
 +? security +? BigData.
 The metamodel of SVB is shown in Figure 4. It shows:
 (a) the inherent architecture of SVB with regard to well
 known concepts such as interface, broker, E-Service, E-
 Contract, SLA, and public facility[6] which includes law,
 local policy and administration; (b) the relationship with
 target problems including service mismatching process-
 ing, service selection, optimization and their composi-
 tion; (c) the target solution in the form of SVB value
 including functional value, QoS value, security value and
 business value in general; (d) the sources of added value
 related to technological innovation related to Big Data
 21
Figure 4. The metamodel of the brokerage supported value added attaining
 processing, new usage discovery and SVB application.
 Different from traditional brokers which focus on func-
 tional value and QoS, the value which is implemented
 by SVB requires the composition of business value and
 functional value.
 B. Tradeoff on long run vs. short run
 1) Influence factors: In classical economics, the profit
 mode of a business transaction will be distinguished
 as long run vs. short run [14]. In a long run, factors
 such as cost and price will be modeled as variables in
 contrast to being modeled as fixed amount in a short
 run. This difference will be reflected directly to value
 added accumulation towards profit-maximization. For a
 short run mode, the value added of PRV or CSV or
 PUV will be positive as long as the marginal cost is
 lower than the marginal revenue which represents the
 added profit corresponding to the increase of a unit of
 production. Similarly a production decrease strategy can
 be made. There are several variability which should be
 taken as knowledge rules to guide the attaining of the
 profit-maximization considering both long run and short
 run.
 • Cost/price adjustment - by taking advantage of the
 timely processing of E-Contracts, SVB can real-
 ize timely adjusting price to balance the ratio of
 price/cost for a short run.
 • Marketing plan - SVB can be composed to imple-
 ment complex price strategies of a long run such as
 at the beginning of a business, the marginal cost
 is allowed to be greater than the marginal price to
 implement the marketing strategy of advertisement,
 the price can be increased since after to gain the
 main profit, and a sold out can be planned to
 recollect the money flow for an investment with
 higher reward business, etc. The general evaluation
 can be positive as long as the average profit in a
 long run is positive.
 • History based prediction - the transaction history of
 customers/providers can be analyzed based on the
 added value calculation on the top of SVB to make
 decision on the adaptation of price and production.
 • Public policy implementation - the public side can
 employ the power of Big Data processing to analyze
 added value from various sources covering both
 PRV and CSV . Corresponding encouragement
 policies can be made when the∑(PRV + CSV )
 is decreasing or the acceleration of the increase of
 the
 
 ∑(PRV + CSV )/time
 is decreasing. Intervention can also be introduced
 to interfere the situation that the provider side
 dominates the price making against customer side
 through the monitoring of the ratio of∑(PRV )/∑(CSV ) .
 2) The general profit: We formulate economic formu-
 las to highlight the general profit calculation in compar-
 ison with traditional business:
 Traditional economics:
 max(profit) ≈ max(?
 capitalspace
 ?
 bussineslifecycle(marginal(price)?marginal(cost)))
 SVB enriched E-Service Economics:
 max(profit) ≈ max(?
 capitalspace
 ?
 strategyspace?
 bussineslifetime(fstrategy(price)?marginal(cost))?fstrategy(cost(SV B))))
 strategyspace ≈ capability(V alueAdded(subcontract(SV B)))budeget??budeget??budeget?
 ?: project time plan; ?: dispensable capital; ?: re-
 source of (i) computation; (ii) storage; and (iii) network
 22
IV. Experimentation
 We implemented a prototype system to show the
 proof of concept of SVB. We pick the personalization
 (right lower corner of the Figure 2 as an example to
 show how the SVB can collaborate with Big Data
 analysis on PUV to improve both the PRV and the
 CSV. In the E-tourism business, recommending suitable
 restaurant for the tourist will increase the degree of
 their satisfaction, At the same time, a good restaurant
 recommendation will increase the profit of restaurant
 and tourism company, reducing complaining. Our system
 offers a value based brokerage service to make per-
 sonalized restaurant recommendation for new customer
 based on previous customer’s rating history. It is devel-
 oped on Mahout Recommender 1. Mahout is an open
 source data mining framework based on MapReduce
 computing model. Its recommender class is extended
 to support multiple recommendation algorithms. We
 use item based recommender and different similarity
 measurements to perform personalized recommendation.
 We use ”Restaurant&ConsumerData” data set 2 from
 UC Irvine’s machine Learning repository. We only use
 its rating final.csv, which records 1161 instances of
 rating information. Each instance represents a rating of
 a customer towards a restaurant. The possible rating
 values are set as 0, 1, 2. We preprocess the data set and
 parse the following format to the Mahout recommender:
 ”customerid | restaurantid | customer?srating”. The
 output produces top ten most preferable restaurants for
 each customer.
 The system partitions the data set into two parts. The
 first 80% of data is fed to the recommender to generate
 the preferable restaurant. The remaining 20% of data
 is used to evaluate the recommendation. We use Mean
 Squared Error (MSE) to evaluate the recommendation
 result. For each customer, if his rating for a certain
 restaurant appears in both the 20% of evaluation data
 and the recommendation result, we compute the MSE
 of those ratings. We generate the average MSE for each
 recommender method. Intuitively, the lower value of
 MSE a method can get, the higher SVB value we will get.
 In the real business scenario, the tourism company may
 delegate the recommendation service to multiple SVB.
 When results return from SVB, the tourism company
 can use its evaluation data set to measure the accuracy
 of the recommendation, and choose the result that brings
 highest value added of PRV, i.e., lowest MSE in this
 case. To simulate such scenario, we perform the Mahout
 item based recommender with different similarity mea-
 surements. The generated mean square error is shown

 in Table I. It indicates that using Pearson correlation
 similarity measurement will bring the highest SVB value.

 Bichler et al.[1] promote to use brokers to enhance the
 application level interpretability of electronic commerce.
 Yu and Lin[30]utilize service brokers to meet SLAs of
 services and construct trust network for bridging repu-
 tation information[18]. Srikumar et al.[27] use a broker
 to enable grid resource searching and distribution where
 a broker functions mostly as an autonomous agent[23].
 D’Mello et al.[5] use a broker to select qualified ser-
 vices in terms of QoS. Loreto et al.[19] use brokers
 to integrate telephone business and IT world in the
 manner of a intermediate layer. Most of existing broker
 researches[21], [17], [24], [4], [20], [13] focus on using
 brokers to discover, match,negotiate, select and compose
 services with best QoS in a service composition from
 either a technological perspective or a business perspec-
 tive. Rosenberg and Dustdar[25] use brokers to bridge
 the difference of heterogenous business rules. Budgen et
 al.[2] introduce an information broker to integrate health
 knowledge and data with enhanced privacy protection.
 SVB relates services not limited to technological level as
 most SLAs based approaches[30] have done but also to
 business level[1], [25]. Cardellini et al.[3] use brokers to
 realize a global cost optimization based on probabilities.
 By integrating business services and technology services
 with value modeling, SVB identifies a bigger diagram
 where it can be applied to gain more value added.
 VI. Conclusion and future work
 Service value broker (SVB) is a critical element for
 constructing a coming era of E-Service Economics [12]
 since it coherently supports IT implementation of service
 system and integration of business strategies under the
 analysis of economical goals. In our previous work we
 have worked on enumerating useful SVBs which can
 be reused directly by stakeholder [11]. To cope with
 the challenges facing the building of a smart E-Tourism
 focusing on the Big Data analysis such as social net-
 work analysis for personalization, and multiple source
 information analysis for government decision making, we
 23
propose to build a problem solving framework from a
 knowledge management base on the SVB. The general
 target is to easy the complexity of the E-Tourism system
 building and the comprehensive improvement of the
 profiting on the service provider side, the satisfaction
 and acceptance on the customer side and the efficiency
 and precision of the market surveillance and control from
 the public administrative side.
 In the future, we will improve the added value model-
 ing modules on each parties and consider comprehensive
 business application. We would like to apply the proto-
 type system to collect first hand feedback from the E-
 Tourism markets in specific agencies in Hainan province
 for further modifications and deeper Big Data analysis.
 The future work will also include exploring the direction
 of SVB composition for MashUp development.
