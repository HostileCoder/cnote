 Abstract—On the web, there are numerous websites pub-
 lishing webpages to cover the events occurring in society.
 The web events data satisfies the well-accepted attributes of
 big data: Volume, Velocity, Variety and Value. As a great
 value of web events data, website preferences can help the
 followers of web events, e.g. peoples or organizations, to select
 the proper websites to follow their interested aspects of web
 events. However, the big volume, fast evolution speed, multi-
 source and unstructured data all together make the value of
 website preferences mining very challenging. In this paper,
 website preference is formally defined at first. Then, according
 to the hierarchical attribute of web events data, we propose
 a hierarchical network model to organize big data of a web
 event from different organizations, different areas and different
 nations at a given time stamp. With this hierarchical network
 structure in hand, two strategies are proposed to mine the
 value of websites preferences from web events data. The first
 straightforward strategy utilizes the communities of keyword-
 level network and the mapping relations between websites and
 keywords to unveil the Value in them. By taking the whole
 hierarchical network structure into consideration, an iterative
 algorithm is proposed in second strategy to refine the keyword
 communities like the first strategy. At last, an evaluation
 criteria of website preferences is designed to compare the
 performances of two proposed strategies. Experimental results
 show the proper combination of horizontal relations (each level
 network) with vertical relations (mapping relations between
 three level networks) can extract more value from web events
 data and then improve the efficiency on website preferences
 mining.

 chical network
 I. INTRODUCTION
 In the modern times of information explosion, big data
 can be seen everywhere, for example, customer transactions
 data, sensor data, gene data, and so on. The coming of
 big data era brings much benefits for nations, organizations,
 companies and each individual. At the same time, it brings
 new challenges for researchers [1]–[3] from both academy
 and industry. Although there is still no well-accepted defi-
 nition of big data, some important attributes are commonly
 accepted, including: Volume, Velocity, Variety and Value.
 Web events data is also a big data. A web event could
 be a hot news story, like a scandal, or the cover of a social
 event in the real world on the web, like an earthquake. For
 example, ‘phone-hacking of News of the World’ and ‘9-11’
 are two web events. Concerning and participating web events
 have become the routine lives of all the cyber citizens in each
 day (Velocity), which leads to the huge number of webpages,
 blogs and posts (Volume) from different kinds of media, like
 twitter, facebook, news websites, blog and forum (Variety).
 With the development of Web, the number of websites also
 increase sharply. To the December of 2012, there are about
 634 million websites on the web 1. Except aforementioned
 four attributes, web events data has its own special attributes,
 which express its special values, comparing gene data or
 customer transaction data. One is that the content of a web
 event is normally not stationary, but it will change with the
 evolution of this web event. This evolution may come from
 the development of a news story and the change of interests
 of its web followers. Another is that there is a hierarchical
 structure. Both of them are the knowledge of web events
 data with great values.
 How are the big data attributes, Volume, Velocity and
 Variety, of web events formed? After the emergence of
 a web event, there will be numerous websites publishing
 webpages to cover it in each day (Volume). In these big
 volume of websites, each one has its own preference on this
 web event, because these websites may belong to different
 organizations, different areas or even different nations. For
 covering same web events, these websites with different
 preferences ‘come together’ to form the Variety attribute
 of web events data. Since the website preferences could
 be seen as the different compositions of aspects of a web
 event, websites generally focus on one or limited number of
 aspects of this web event, as shown in Fig. 1. Take ‘phone-
 hacking of News of the World’ as an example, a website,
 www2.canada.com2, mainly focuses on ‘Impact on ethics of
 internet journalism’ aspect of this web event. Meanwhile,
 another website, www.guardian.co.uk3, shows interests in
 the aspect, ‘Criminal charges and convictions’, of this web
 event. By the way, these aspects will keep change with
 the evolution of a web event everyday or even everyhour

 preferences of two related websites on this web event: one is the ‘college degree’ and the other one is his ‘girlfriend’.
 (Velocity): some aspects may disappear, some aspects may
 be preserve and some new aspects may arise. These aspects
 and their temporal changes not only reflect the Variety and
 Velocity attributes of web events data, but also show the
 Value and its variation of web events data.
 What are the Value of website preferences in web events
 data used for? The formation of preference of a website on
 web events is mainly for satisfying followers of this website.
 The values of identifying them are: 1) instead of the most
 visited ones in a huge number of websites, the specified
 websites can be recommended to users or organizations who
 have the same interest with these websites. Then, users can
 follow their interested aspects of web events by following
 the recommended websites without consuming time and
 energy to follow all the websites or to search for the desired
 information from all the webpages, blogs and posts; 2)
 The advertisers can also benefit from website preferences.
 Since web events can attract many people’s attentions, the
 companies can put their advertises of products or services
 to the proper websites for pushing up sales. Apparently,
 they should choose the websites which preferences on
 web events have big correlations with their products and
 services; 3) automatically identify the malicious websites
 which only publish malicious aspect of web events. If the
 slander information of a web event is only come from one
 website, it is possible that this website is spreading slander
 information with purpose. This is especially valuable for
 some administrations, like governments and organizations.
 To summarize, web events data has the typical attributes
 of big data. 1) Volume: there are huge number of websites
 and webpages to cover them; 2) Velocity: as the routine lives
 of cyber citizen, the information of web events is updated
 every day or even every hour and minutes; 3) Variety:
 web events will be discussed on different media, like news
 websites, blogs, forums by different unstructured formats,
 like news webpages, blogs and posts; 4) Value: as one
 part of value expression, the website preferences have great
 value for nations, organizations, companies and individuals.
 Except for these attributes, web events data has its own
 attributes: 1) the content of them will evolve with time. After
 a period of time, they may evolve to another brand new web
 event; 2) there is hierarchical structure hidden in the web
 events data. The top level is composed by different media,
 the middle level is composed by the webpages, posts and
 blogs from different media and the bottom level is composed
 by keywords contained in the items of second level. Since
 the website preferences can be represented as keywords of
 web events and these preferences should be exhibited by
 webpages, there are inter-dependency and inter-limitation
 relations between different levels.
 The difficulties for the website preferences Value mining
 of web events data are mainly from its another three big data
 attributes. In this paper, we only focus on its Variety attribute
 to mine the value of website preferences. The difficulties
 lie on: 1) Lacking an organizing model for huge number
 of multi-source unstructured data; 2) Lacking of methods to
 utilize the hierarchical structure attribute of web events data.
 Considering above mentioned difficulties of website pref-
 erences value mining and attributes of web events data,
 we firstly give a hierarchical model, three-level-network:
 website level network, webpage level network and key-
 word level network, to reveal and organize different level
 informations about a web event at one time stamp. Sec-
 ondly, we propose two strategies to automatically mine the
 website preferences based on three-level-network. The first
 strategy is a straightforward one. Keyword communities of
 keyword network, which unifies the different formates of
 information from different sources (from Variety attribute),
 of a given web event are considered as the different aspects
 of this web event. And by the mapping relation between
 websites and keywords in keyword network, the website
 preferences are computed. Based on the first strategy, the
 second strategy is proposed to incorporate the mapping
 relations between websites, webpages and keywords which
 are used to constrain the formation of keyword communities
 of keyword network. This mapping relations integrate the
 1044
influences from different materials coming from different
 sources which is just the one ignored by the first strategy.
 At last, an evaluation metric is developed to compare the
 performances of two strategies. Experimental results show
 the proper combination of horizontal relations (each level
 network) with vertical relations (mapping relations between
 three level networks) can improve the efficiency on website
 preferences mining in web events data.
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows. The formal
 question and basic idea of our work is given in the next
 section. In Section III, we review some related works.
 Two strategies are detailedly introduced in Section IV and
 Section V, respectively. In Section VI, the evaluation metric
 is developed and experiment results are shown. Section VII
 concludes.
 II. PROBLEM DEFINITION AND BASIC IDEA
 A. Problem Definition
 Definition 1 (Web Event): A web event is a hot story on
 the web, which is composed by some sub-topics.
 e = {t0, t1, · · · , tT?1} (1)
 where ti is ith sub-topic of a web event e and T is the
 number of sub-topics of this web event. Different sub-
 topics will mainly express different aspects of this web
 event. Normally, a sub-topic has its own relative independent
 semantics of a web event,
 ti =< wk0 , wk1 , · · · , wkN?1 > (2)
 where ki is the ith keyword of a web event, N is the number
 of all keywords in a web event and wki is the weight of
 keyword ki in this sub-topic. The sub-topics will change
 with time including the relative important status of them
 and the emergence of new sub-topics or the vanish of some
 sub-topics. These changes of sub-topics in a web event may
 come from getting or losing attentions of people on this web
 event and are also called evolution of this web event.
 Definition 2 (Website Preference): The preference of a
 website on a given web event is a distribution of all sub-topic
 of this web event and can be represented as,
 P es =< wt0 , wt1 , · · · , wtT?1 >, wti ? [0, 1] (3)
 where wti is the degree of website s concerning on the sub-
 topic ti of a web event e.
 Normally, a website will only focus on limited number
 of sub-topics of web events except for the comprehensive
 websites. Take ‘9-11’ as the example again, the huge number
 of webpages are from a number of websites. As we talked
 former, a webpage could contain different sub-topics of this
 web event, it implies that a website can also concern on
 many sub-topics as well. However, a website generally has
 its own preference on a given web event. For example, a
 website in economy category has big probability to report
 economy influence of ‘9-11’, so the weight on economy
 sub-topic of this website will be bigger comparing other
 sub-topics. So, the distribution of weights on different sub-
 topics just reflect the preference of a website on a web
 event. However, due to the Variety attribute of web events
 data, the huge number of webpages and websites make this
 distribution of weights hard to uncover.
 The final goal of this paper is to mine the website
 preferences on a given web event under the Variety
 attribute of web events data.
 B. Construct three-level-networks to organize variety infor-
 mation of a web event
 In this paper, the information of a web event is organized
 as three level networks: website level, webpage level and
 keyword level. At first, the keywords are mined by classical
 method, tf -idf , and linked by the co-occurrence relations
 between them,
 rKki,kj =
 Dki,kj
 D
 (4)
 where K denotes the keyword level; rki,kj is the co-
 occurrence relation between two keywords ki and kj ; Dki,kj
 is the number of webpages which contains keywords ki
 and kj simultaneously; D is the number of all webpages.
 Co-occurrence relation is a weak semantic relation between
 keywords, which implies the probability of two keywords
 showing in same webpage at the same time. Connecting all
 the keywords by their relations, we can get the keyword
 level network,
 ALNK =
 ?
 ????
 rK0,0 r
 K
 0,1 r
 K
 0,2 · · · r
 K
 0,K?1
 rK1,0 r
 K
 1,1 r
 K
 1,2 · · · r

 rKK?1,0 r

 K?1,1 r
 K
 K?1,2 · · · r
 K
 K?1,K?1
 ?
 ????
 The same with webpage level and website level, we can
 get ALND and ALNS .
 In order to filter out the noisy relations in each level
 network, the pruning method [4] is adopted to post-process
 all three level networks. Only the spanning tree and part of
 neighbors of the nodes in this tree are kept.
 Some frequently used symbols in this paper are listed in

 many webpages, one of which may contain many keywords.
 C. Basic Idea
 Our idea to resolve the former problem, website prefer-
 ences mining from web events data with Variety attribute,
 is to use the three-level-network from special Hierarchical
 attribute of web events data. As shown in Fig. 2, a website
 may contain many webpages and a webpage may contain
 many keywords in a web event. In turn, a keyword could
 belong to many webpages and a webpage could also be
 published by many websites. Notice that a webpage is
 traditionally only published by one website. However, the
 two webpages with same content from two distinct websites
 are seen as one webpage from both these websites in this
 paper. So, we merge the webpages with similar content here.
 The reason is that some webpages may be reprint of one
 webpage. As the first and significant step, we want to provide
 a unified model to organize all the information about a web
 event with whatever formate and from whatever sources.
 There is interdependent relations between each levels. The
 preference on a given web event of a website needs to be
 expressed by its webpages and the aspects covered by a
 webpage about a web event need to be expressed by its
 keywords. In turn, the existence of keywords relies on the
 existence of webpages and the existence of webpages relies
 on the existence of websites. It is just mapping relations that
 gives us way to link the different level networks together
 and thereby link their values together. Then, we can mine
 the website preferences from web events data not only by
 its own webpages but also by all the webpages, websites
 and keywords. In the next sections, we will introduce
 different specific strategies to utilize this three-level-network
 for mining the preferences on web events of websites.
 III. RELATED WORKS
 There are two parts of works which have relations with
 our work, including the researches on websites and commu-
 nity detection in complex network.
 A. Works on websites
 The first part of researches on website is the website
 evaluation. Shanshan Qi [5] suggests that a website should
 be evaluated from three aspects: usefulness, service quality
 and physical accessibility. The qualities of content and
 structure of websites will impact on their usage preferences
 which means the efficiency of using these websites. The
 second part of researches on website is to generate website
 overview. A recommender system, Pharos, is proposed to
 help new users understand the contents of the website by
 giving a overview of the whole content-centered website [6].
 For contextual advertising, Website hierarchies are learned
 by URL. Last part of researches on website is to com-
 pute similarity between websites. A new content sensitive
 method, STRank [7], is proposed to consider the semantic
 and time relevance of websites rather than considering link
 property. In this way, semantic relatedness is added to the
 similarity computation rather than only considering keyword
 match. Although some of them are content based analysis,
 they have not paid attentions on the preferences of different
 websites on the web events. Considering the huge number
 of websites covering web events, their preferences are of
 significance for user services.
 B. Works on community detection
 Recently, complex network is of significance to model
 the complex system which has been used in many fields,
 including biological area, physical area, information area,
 and so on. Community is a very important feature of
 complex network. A community is a subgraph of a network
 and a network can be seen as the union of different com-
 munities in turn. The basic principle to detect communities
 is to minimizing the number of links between different
 communities and maximizing the number of links in single
 community. Two classical strategies are: Aggregation and
 Division [8]. There are also some other methods, including
 spectral-based method, statistical method. More works about
 community detection is discussed in [9].
 IV. INTUITIVE METHOD
 In this paper, the communities of keyword level network
 are adopted to represent sub-topics of a given web event.
 Since each keyword is a semantic unit of a web event,
 a community composed by a number of keywords which
 have relative close relations with each others can be seen
 as a sub-topic of a web event. This keyword network and
 communities unify the information of different formates and
 from different sources about a web event. By these keyword
 communities, each item about this web event and in this
 three-level-network can be represented using the same way.
 After giving the definitions in Section II, the most straight-
 forward method to get the preferences of websites would be
 to detect the communities of keyword level network and then
 these detected communities could be seen as the different
 1046
Figure 3: Intuitive method to discover the preferences of
 websites. In this figure, there are three sample websites and
 related four communities in keyword level network. It is the
 keywords that connect the communities with websites.
 sub-topics of a web event. The preferences of websites could
 be computed as the membership degrees on each community.
 The procedure of this method can be described as,
 1) Construct keyword network of a number of webpages
 published on a number of websites;
 2) Do community detection on this keyword network;
 3) compute the membership degree of each website on
 the detected communities.
 An example is given in Fig. 3. There are four communities
 in keyword level network of a given web event. Website S1
 has relation with two communities C1 and C4, website S2
 has relation with two communities C2 and C4 and Website
 S3 has relation with three communities C2, C3 and C4,
 PS1 =< wC1 , wC4 >
 PS2 =< wC2 , wC4 >
 PS3 =< wC2 , wC3 , wC4 >
 (5)
 where wCi is the membership degree of each website on a
 community/sub-topic. The PSi is just the website preference
 value that we want to mine from web events data with
 Variety attribute. Because of the communities of keyword-
 level network, this method has considered the relations be-
 tween keywords and the website-keyword mapping relation.
 However, the relations between keywords with webpages
 and websites with webpages are ignored.
 V. ITERATIVE METHOD
 The communities of keyword level network are only
 based on the keyword relations between each other, the
 horizontal relations in Fig. 2. These relations imply that the
 keywords, which have close association relations with each
 others, will be more likely to describe same sub-topic of a
 web event. Actually, the webpage level network will also
 influence the formation of communities at keyword level.
 When all the keywords are in the same webpage by the
 mapping relations between keywords and webpages, it is
 also possible that they are talking the same sub-topic of

 cong = congnew;

 for sj = 0; sj ≤ S ? 1 do
 ALNnewS [si][sj ] = cos( vCKsi , vCKsj );
 end
 end
 ALNS = ?ALNS + (1? ?)ALNnewS ;
 {CSi } = communitydetection(ALNS) ;

 a web event. However, the relations in the keyword level
 network, ALNK , do not take the mapping relations into
 consideration, which only consider the statistical values of
 co-occurrence relations in all the webpages. For example,
 two keywords, ki and kj , have a small co-occurrence relation
 which means that they do not usually show in the webpages
 simultaneously. However, if two webpages which contain
 keywords, ki and kj , respectively and they are in the same
 community of webpage level network, keywords, ki and kj ,
 also have big probability to talk about same sub-topic of a
 web event. Similarly, the communities of webpage level are
 also influenced by the mapping relations between webpages
 and websites. All in all, the information of different gran-
 ularities, different formates and even different sources all
 has close relations with each other, not only related in the
 each level network. These ‘vertical’ relations also contain
 great value for mining website preferences and should not
 be overlooked. Inspired by their inter-dependency and inter-
 limitation relations of websites, webapges and keywords, an
 iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize the formation of
 keyword communities/sub-topics, as shown in Algorithm 1.
 At first, the communities of keyword level network,
 1047
CKi = {s}, s ? ALNK , are detected as initialization. Then,
 by the mapping relations between keywords with websites,
 each website is represented as a vector of communities of
 keyword level network, vCKsi =< ?CK0 , ?CK1 , . . . , ?CKnk?1 >,
 where nk is the number of communities of keyword level
 network and ?CKi is indicator function that shows whether
 this website si is in community CKi . If we consider all
 different media of a web event, each one can also be
 represented as above. This representation can unify the
 different media from Variety attribute of web events data.
 The similarity between two websites which are represent-
 ed as keyword community vectors is computed by cosine
 method. This similarity considers the mapping relations
 between keywords and websites. So, based on these new
 mapping relations, a new website network, ALNnewS , is
 constructed and incorporated into ALNS ,
 ALNS = (1? ?)ALNS + ?ALNnewS (6)
 where ? is the ratio of community-based website network
 ALNnewS . This combination can change the communities
 of this network. It can be seen from Equation 6 that the
 communities detected from ALNS are based on two kinds
 of relations between websites:
 1) Co-occurrence relations
 2) Mapping relations with keywords
 Similar to the mapping relations between websites and
 keywords, there are also mapping relations between web-
 sites and webpages. So, the communities of webpage level
 network are also influenced by structure of website level
 network. Each webpage can also be represented as a vector
 of communities of website level network,
 
 vC
 S
 di =< ?CS0 , ?CS1 , . . . , ?CSns?1 >
 where ns is the number of communities of website level
 network and ?CSi is indicator function that shows whether
 this webpage di is in community CSi . Then, the combination
 of new webpage network from the similarity of vector
 representation and original webpage network is,
 ALND = (1? ?)ALND + ?ALNnewD (7)
 Similar with websites and webpages, a keyword can also
 be represented as,
 
 vC
 D
 ki =< ?CD0 , ?CD1 , . . . , ?CDnk?1 >
 where nk is the number of communities of website level
 network. Then, the combination of new keyword network
 from the similarity of vector representation and original
 keyword network is,
 ALNK = (1? ?)ALNK + ?ALNnewK
 Apparently, this is an iterative procedure. The variation
 between communities of keyword level networks of two
 iterations is computed. When this variation does not reduce,
 the stopping criteria is reached. Note that this condition can
 only make sure it reach the local optimization, which is
 enough from the experimental results.
 This iterative procedure also show the way how each item
 in different levels affect each others, not only the items
 in the same level but also the items in different levels.
 Think following scenario: a person want to express his
 knowledge (like opinions, criticisms, visions or founds) on a
 web event. He can publish on a news webpage on a website
 by (formally) cooperating with a journalist; he can write a
 blog to (semi-formally) express his own opinions; he can
 also have (informally) communications with other persons
 on his micro-blog. All of these information come from this
 person, so they must have relations with each others and this
 kind of relations should be considered.
 Through the new added mapping relations, each item in
 the second level, which is webpage-level-network here, can
 make contribution to the website preferences value mining
 despite they may have different formates or different sources
 (due to Variety attribute of web events data) and the item
 could be any form not only webpage. At the same time,
 we can get the more accurate preferences for the sources in
 first level, which is website-level-network here. This refined
 accurateness cannot be captured by the single source alone.
 Similarly, the sources could not only be website.
 Finally, the communities of keyword network are con-
 sidered as different sub-topics like first strategy: Intuitive
 Method. The website preferences are computed by the map-
 ping relations between websites and keyword communities.
 VI. EXPERIMENTS
 A. Evaluation Criteria
 In order to compare the performances of proposed meth-
 ods, an evaluation criteria is designed based on the char-
 acteristic of website preferences that is the preference of a
 website on a web event will be kept during the evolution of
 this web event. According to this characteristic, the average
 change of website preferences on a given web event during
 a period of time is used to compare the three methods.
 Instead of change of preferences of a same website at two
 time stamps, the similarity between them Sims is computed
 by comparing the distribution of sub-topics at these two time
 stamps for computation convenience.

 t?j is the number of common keywords at two time
 stamps. The forms of Eq. 8 and 9 are used to make sure the
 maximum value of Sim(t??1i , t?j ) is 1.
 B. Case Study
 Next, a web event, ‘Japan Nuclear Leakage’, is analyzed.
 The webpages about this web event is crawled from the
 biggest Chinese search engine, ‘Baidu’. It should be noticed
 that, although the webpages used here are Chinese, the
 proposed algorithms in this paper can be used for any
 language. The data we downloaded contains 35 days of this
 web event and average number of websites, webpages and
 keywords are 81, 99 (after merge the similar webpages) and
 790, respectively. The community detection algorithm used
 in the experiment is VoltageClusterer of JUNG 4.
 For comparing the two methods proposed in this paper
 for website preferences value mining , we compute the
 Sims of each website of this web event by two different
 methods. The bigger this value is, the more efficient the
 method is and the more value this method can extract
 from variety web events data. Since there is a param-
 eter, ?, in Iterative Method, we try different value of

 Figure 5: The Sims of each website by different algorithms,
 including intuitive and iterative method with different ?.
 ? ? {0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0}. The dif-
 ferent values of ? denote different ways of combination of
 network structures with mapping relations between them.
 When ? = 0.0, Iterative Method (denoted as nw) becomes
 Intuitive Method (denoted as iw).
 The Sims of all websites by both methods is computed
 through Eq. 8. The results of four websites are shown in
 Fig. 4, including www.chinavalue.net, www.huanquan.com,
 world.people.com.cn, news.xinhuanet.com. We can see from
 this figure that not all the ways of combination (?) of
 mapping relations with network structures can help to im-
 prove the performances of website preferences mining. The
 Iterative Method reaches its best on four websites with
 ? = 0.4. At this value, the website preferences can be
 preserved along the evolution of web events. Is this value
 of ? due to our websites selection? Then, we average over
 all the websites on different values of ?, shown in Fig.
 5. It can be seen from this figure that Iterative Method
 still reaches its best on ? = 0.4. So, all the Sims of all
 the websites from Iterative method with ? = 0.4 and the
 Intuitive Method are given in Fig. 6. It means that ? = 0.4 is
 the perfect combination of network structures of three levels
 with their mapping relations for this web event. Under this
 combination, the value in the variety data can be extract most
 and the formated keyword communities with their weights
 can best represent the website preferences, which can give
 the most benefits for the nations, organizations, companies
 and individuals. Note that the absolute value of ? is also
 influenced by the evolution of a web event, which is an
 attribute of web events data as we discussed former. Since
 two methods are compared by the same web event, this kind
 of influence is removed. For some web events, the evolution
 between consecutive days is intense, then the value of ?
 tends to be small and vice verse.
 VII. CONCLUSION AND FURTHER STUDY
 In this paper, we have shown that web events data
 is also a big data, which satisfies the well-accepted four

 attributes of big data: Volume, Velocity, Variety and Value.
 At the same time, its own two specific attributes are also
 discussed. Among all the values of web events data, website
 preferences have been formally defined and focused here.
 The practical usages of values of website preferences have
 also been shown. In order to mine website preference from
 web events data with multi-source and unstructured data
 (Variety), we have proposed a three-level-network model
 to organize different granularities of information of a web
 event. From top to bottom, this hierarchical model contains
 website-level, webpage-level and keyword-level. Then, two
 strategies have been given to mine the website preferences
 by the three-level-network. The first strategy has only con-
 sidered keyword network structure and website-keyword
 mapping relations. The second strategy has considered each
 level network structure and mapping relations between three
 level networks. Finally, the experiments show that the proper
 combination of network structures and mapping relations can
 help to improve the efficiency of website preferences value
 mining from web events data.
 In the future, we will extend the data scale and study the
 different community detection algorithms to the efficiency
 of our method.
