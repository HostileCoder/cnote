 Abstract—The data that the Internet of Things(IOT) produced
 is fuzzy and enormous, and the Complex Events
 Processing(CEP) which is the key part of the Internet of
 Things need to meet the big data’s quantity and complexity. In
 CEP, how to describe the context and infer from the context is
 the most important, and in this paper, a fuzzy D-S theory and
 fuzzy ontology based context model is proposed, according to
 the model, we design a similarity based context reasoning
 method. The experimental results show that this method can
 support fuzzy context in CEP and have better performance
 and accuracy than other methods.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 As the RFID and sensor network technical developed
 quickly, the apply range of the Internet of Things become
 more and more extensive. Among this, how to process the
 information, especially different kinds of data is the key
 problem. The complex events processing of Internet Of
 Things[1] demand complete devices could recognize the
 current context information and its transformation of users
 and make the response to this. Among this procedure, the
 collecting and processing of the context information play
 the important role. Since the description of the context
 information model exists heterogeneity, however, the
 machine may has a different understanding for the same
 context, so it is very hard to achieve the knowledge's
 sharing and reusing, and makes the knowledge based
 reasoning much complicated, on the other hand, as the
 limitation of hardware device and network transmission
 problem, the information that collected may be incomplete
 and high-level context information which deduced from the
 uncertain perception data also exists uncertainty. Hence,
 how to describe the context information formalized and able
 to use the uncertainty to execute knowledge reasoning,
 judgment and decision making has become particularly
 important.
 A well accepted definition of context is proposed by
 Dey [2], “a Context is any information that can be used to
 characterize the situation of an entity. An entity is a person,
 place, or object that is considered relevant to the interaction
 between a user and an application, including the user and
 application themselves.” And the ontology modeling has a
 higher formalization level and a good inference capability,
 its representation of the complex and dependency
 relationship between context data make it well accepted
 solution by many researchers. But its biggest weakness is
 that the representation and processing of the fuzzy and
 uncertainty context problem [3]. Therefore, in this article a
 fuzzy D-S theory based fuzzy ontology context modeling
 approach is proposed correspondingly, the fuzzy D-S theory
 is also presented to deal with the uncertainty fuzzy context
 reasoning problem.
 In this paper we describe a fuzzy D-S Theory and fuzzy
 ontology based context modeling and an algorithm used for
 similarity based context reasoning. The structure of this
 paper is as follows: the context modeling and similarity
 based reasoning will be introduced in the next section, and in
 section III, we introduction some concepts about context
 modeling and discuss the fuzzy D-S theory and fuzzy
 ontology based context modeling. In section IV, we discuss
 the algorithm of the similarity based context reasoning. In
 section V, some simulation is presented. And we make a
 conclusion about this paper in section VI.
 II. RELATED WORK
 The common used context modeling approach concludes:
 1) Key-Value model, which is easy to manipulate but it is
 not convenient for complicated structure and does not
 permit a good reasoning on context. Many of the early
 researches used this approach, such as Schilit et.al. [4] used a
 Key-Value model to represent the location context. 2) Mark-
 up models are most of the time specific to a particular field
 and are limited to some aspects of context. The
 representative method of this model is CC/PP [5] , which is
 though too simple but supplied a basis for other models to
 extend. Comparing to the key-value model, markup model
 already has a better structure and can describe complex data
 structures. 3) Graphical models are simple but less formal
 than the other models. 4) Object oriented models require
 low level execution agreements between applications to
 ensure interoperability. For example, Bouzy [6] used the OO

model to deal with the computer go related context
 information, the GUIDE project [7] used Active object model
 to encapsulate and process context. 5) Logic based model
 try to represent the context using fact, expression and rule.
 In 1993 McCarthy et.al. [8] had already researched and
 published the earliest logic based context model
 Formalizing Context. 6) Ontology based model is good at
 representing the relationship between the computing
 concepts and many papers are all based this method.
 As to the similarity based context reasoning, Chun et.al.
 [9] presented a similarity based Distributed Context
 Reasoning with layer context model, this method enhance
 the trust of reasoning outcomes than the earlier approach.
 The reference [10] proposed a similarity based reasoning
 method with the D-S theory applied, in the paper, the new
 context merge with the most similar context and have no
 influence with other branches.
 III. CONTEXT MODELING
 Generally, An ontology is an explicit specification of a
 conceptualization. It means that ontology is an explicit,
 shared and formal description of important concepts and
 their relationships. Ontology based context model has strong
 expression ability and can deduce the high level context
 information. Moreover, it is also easy for the knowledge
 sharing and reusing, and there are many mature ontology
 base that can be reused. With help of ontology user and
 system can communicate with each other. But the ontology
 based context model cannot handle the fuzzy context
 information and their uncertainty reasoning. For example,
 the context information could be “very fast” and “very
 slow”. So we propose to use the fuzzy ontology to address
 this issue. Several fuzzy ontology descriptions have been
 proposed [11], its basic definition is described as follows:
 Definition 1 Fuzzy Ontology: a fuzzy ontology of
 domain D is a quintuple defined as O(D)= <I, C, T, N,
 X>,for details: I is the individual set which includes all the
 instances, C is the concepts set which includes all the
 concepts of the domain D,T is the fuzzy taxonomic
 relationship, N is fuzzy non-taxonomic relationship and X is
 axioms that expressed in a logical language.
 Definition 2 Extended Fuzzy Ontology: an extended
 fuzzy ontology means extending the Entity E, fuzzy
 taxonomic relation T, fuzzy non-taxonomic relationship N
 as <V, M>, where V and M is the corresponding linguistic
 variable set and membership function. Fox example, Speed
 = <{Slow, Medium, Quick}, {S, M, Q}> and S, M, Q are
 depicted in Eq. (1).

 Unfortunately currently there are no corresponding
 fuzzy ontology standards from w3c yet. So we just build our
 fuzzy context ontology FOCM using the extension of
 OWL2 [12].
 In this paper, as we can see from the figure 1,it is a
 fragment of the fuzzy ontology context model, the main
 entity are Person and Comp Entity, the real line arrow is
 means has a relationship, and the triangular arrow means is
 a relationship, for example ,the Driver is a subclass of
 Person, the Car is a subclass of Device, the Driver has a
 relationship with the Car, in other words, Driver could drive
 the Car, this relationship is a fuzzy relationship, because we
 don’t know where or how fast does the drivers the car. Also,
 the Car has a speed property, and at most time, we say the
 driver drives the car with a slow or medium or quick speed,
 it is a fuzzy concepts, so we can describe it use the extended
 fuzzy ontology like the Definition 2 depicts.
 Figure 1. FOCM Fragment
 Based the basic fuzzy ontology model, in this paper,
 we add three necessary external classes, the three classes
 and its relations are as the figure 2 shows.
 Figure 2. Basic added classes and its relations
 Like the figure 2 shows, we can know the three added
 classes: Conclusion, Evidence, BPA that represents the high
 708
level context, low level context and the basic possibility
 assignment function respectively. And Conclusion and
 Evidence both has an attribute called type that distinguish
 the discrete and continuous type of context and another
 attribute called level that reflects the context level. There are
 both two kinds of Conclusion and Evidence, the discrete one
 (DiscConclusion, DiscEvidence) and the continuous one
 (ContConclusion, ContEvidence). For the former only the
 choosing values will be presented, while the latter one needs
 to define all the linguistic variable and their corresponding
 membership functions. For example, in the figure1,the
 Driver can be see as the Evidence in some situations, and it
 has a DiscEvidence like the Name and a ContEvidence like
 the Age, name is a choosing value and age sometimes it
 may be a fuzzy value. Each pair of Conclusion and
 Evidence relates one BPA instance, which contains the
 occurrence possibility of the candidate conclusion value
 deduced from a certain evidence. Based this model, then, we
 can carry on the reasoning. Otherwise, the BPA class has
 two object properties: consTo attribute represents its related
 evidences, while the has Consbpa identifies all the related
 conclusion and corresponding mass functions.
 IV. CONTEXT REASONING
 A. Rule based and ontology reasoning
 Rule based reasoning method which takes the existing
 facts match the predefined rules to produce new knowledge.
 For example, when the sensors collect that John is in driving
 and the speed is slow, the brake light is bright, then we can
 infer John is parking. Ontology reasoning is similar with the
 rule based reasoning, and use the rules which are defined by
 OWLlanguageitself,likeSymmetricProperty,TransitivePrope
 rty and so on, so as to obtain implicit knowledge from the
 explicit definitions and declarations.
 B. D-S theory based reasoning
 D-S Theory[13] is proposed by Dempster in 1968,and
 his student Shafter improve it in 1971,so it’s called D-S
 theory. The basic D-S theory is as follows:
 Definition 3: assume that ? is set of possible
 conclusions to be drawn, which is called assumption space,
 discernment framework. We can regard a subset of the
 framework as a proposition, the belief degree of assigned to
 each proposition calls the basic possibility assignment (BPA,
 also calls function m),m(A) reflects the belief size of A.A
 BPA under a certain ? is a function :2??[0,1] such that the
 following two conditions hold:
 
 
 
 A
 Amandm 1)(0)( ?2?
 Definition 4:under discernment framework ? the
 belief function based on BPA m can be defined as:
 
 
 
 AB
 BmABel )()( ?3?
 Definition 5:the plausibility function under
 discernment framework ? and BPA m is:
 
 	

 
 AB
 BmAPl )()( ?4?
 In the D-S theory, for an assumption A under
 discernment framework ?, its belief function Bel(A) and
 plausibility function Pl(A) can be calculated according to
 the basic probability assignment BPA, then the belief
 interval[Bel(A),Pl(A)] will be used to identify certainty
 degree of this assumption.
 Having all these basic concepts, different evidence’s
 BPA will be combined to deduce the occurrence probability
 of ?. Assume m1 and m2 are the BPA deduced from the
 two independent evidence source, In this paper, the
 extended Dempster combinational rules is used to calculate
 the new BPA. The formula is as follows:

 In this paper, we proposed a similarity based context
 reasoning algorithm, the general process of this algorithm is
 presented in the follow figure:
 Figure 3.Algorithm flow chart
 (1):Ensure the evidence set and conclusion set in the
 domain, then, we should ensure the all evidence set’s
 subsets and its BPA value, the value of m is represents the
 perspective which people according to the propositions
 make. Once we acquire the BPA value ,and then we can
 combine the evidence that comes from the different
 evidence resources.
 (2):In this paper, before we combine the evidences, we
 have to weigh and correct the BPA value, because in the
 classic theory combination rules, the evidences that
 combination involved must have the equal weigh, but in the
 complex events processing in the Internet Of Things ,the
 evidences which acquire from different evidence sources
 have a different weigh to the target’s importance and
 reliability, so we should weigh and correct the BPA value
 709
before the evidences combined. The correct formula is as
 followed:
 
 

 For different context complication, the Bel’s obtaining
 is also different, but in general, it follows the following
 rules:
 a):The evidence’s importance and reliability much
 higher, the corresponding corrected coefficient much bigger,
 it means the bigger weights are assigned to the important
 evidence.
 b):The evidence’s conflict much higher, the
 corresponding corrected coefficient much smaller, in other
 words, it need to correct it much larger and pass the
 reliability of the conflict to the unknown field.
 The literature[14] proposed the weighed combination
 rules to merge the evidences, solve the evidence theory’s
 shortages when evidences highly conflicts, but this method
 is not adaptive, so in this paper, we use the extended
 combination rules and only merge the most similar fuzzy
 subset and has no influence to other branches to achieve
 adaptive.
 (3):After the former two steps, we then combine the
 evidences, first, we should use the formula (7) to find the
 most similar two subsets of the evidence set, C and A are
 the two fuzzy subset, and their similarity is:
  
 t
 iaicAC )()(11),(
 ~~
  ?7?
 This formula is proved to be accurate, as soon as we
 acquires their BPA value, weigh and correct it, then merge
 the two subsets to generate the high level context and use
 the extended Dempster combinational rules to calculate the
 new BPA value.At last,return the conclusion.
 pseudo-code:
 Em,En are two random fuzzy sets of EvidenceSet
 ?i??int i=0;
 LOOP
 i<—levelContext?
 EvidenceSet?i?<—selectEvidence???
 LOOP
 selectMostSimilarity(Em);
 Weigh(EvidenceSet);
 ConclusionSet(i)<—Merge?Em?En??
 Return BPA value;
 EvidenceSet(i)<—EvidenceSet(i)-Em;
 If(!EvidenceSet(i)){
 Break;
 }
 End if;
 End Loop?
 i++?
 End LOOP?
 First, ensure the context level i, and then execute the
 selectEvidence() method, this method will select the
 evidences and ensure the evidence set of level i.Next, we
 find a random fuzzy subset of evidence set calls Em, use the
 selectMostSimilarity() method to find the another most
 similar fuzzy subset of the common evidence set, for
 example the answer is En, then, we weigh and correct the
 subset Em and En and merge the two sets to generate the
 new high level context, after return the new BPA value, we
 delete the subset Em of the EvidenceSet, and back to find
 another random fuzzy subset until there is not a subset in
 EvidenceSet.
 V. EXAMPLE SCENARIO
 Let us consider this traffic scenario: when the driver
 drives the car, the state around it includes: driver
 information, location information, speed property, the
 services around and device information and so on. We can
 deduce the driver’s destination and driving statement
 through these context information and driving lines formerly.
 So, we should model the state of the driving, and then doing
 the uncertain reasoning to reach the conclusion.
 A. Modeling
 We can establish the fuzzy ontology model according
 to the section II, assume the discernment framework
 ?={{Home},{Working Place}, {Restaurant}, {Parking}},
 and the related context property information also called
 evidence E={Speed, Time, Current Road, Passed
 Road},then we should ensure the state space of each context
 property
 information:Speed={Slow,General,Quick},Time={Morning,
 Afternoon,Night}, Current Road={Jiefang Road},Passed
 Road={Hongxing Road, Yuhua Road}, at last, according to
 the formerly driving lines to determine the relationship
 between the context property information and the reasoning
 results.
 B. Reasoning
 The uncertain reasoning process is a course that merge
 the evidence through the combination rules. In this
 experiment, we obtains the BPA values by the formerly
 driving lines.And calculate the Bel value with the formula
 (6),in order to make the reasoning method adaptive, the Bel
 value also should reference the formerly data, the details as
 followed:
 (1):Establish the users’s driving statement table, the
 table mainly storage the car’s ID, destination(that is
 conclusion) and the times of the conclusion to acquire the
 conclusion’s time and other information. When reasoning,
 compare with the conclusion in the table and update the
 times and other information ,so as to calculate the Bel value
 next time.
 (2):Calculate Bel value, Assume the destination in the
 table are D1,D2,...,Dn, and the corresponding times are
 t1,t2,...,tn, in the reasoning process, assume the used evidence
 710
are E1,E2,...,Em, and each Bel value of the evidence are
 Bel1,Bel2,...,Belm, then , we consider Ei has the most weigh
 to the Di,so we find the maximum ti, assume it is the
 tmax ,and then we can calculate the Bel with the followed
 formula :
 Belj = tj/tmax (8)
 When the context information changed, generates the
 new context, calculate the similarity with other contexts use
 the formula (7),then, the new context merges the most
 similar context, generates the high level context.
 For example, if the car’s speed is changed from quick
 to slow, this is a new context, we find the most similar
 context in this level is :”the current traffic situation is
 flowing”, hence, the two fuzzy set will deduce a conclusion
 set:{{the front of the road is red light(0.2)},{the driver will
 go to restaurant(0.5)},{the driver is making phone
 calls(0.3)}}.In order to acquire a much more accurate
 conclusion, we need to merges the new generated contexts
 with the next level context, and continue to find the most
 similar context in the next level, and we find the context is
 this:” in the front of this road has a traffic light and there is
 no restaurant around ”, so we can achieve the new
 conclusion set: {{the front of the road is red light(0.8)},
 {the driver is making phone calls(0.2)}}, and now we can
 know the front of the road is red light would be the right
 answer.
 In this paper, we use 10 groups of test cases to test the
 algorithm compares with the method reference[10] proposed,
 and for the 10 groups, the size is increased by 1000, the
 results is showed in figure 4(0.8 means among the 1000 test
 cases,800 of it is the right result). It shows that with the
 fuzzy sets increases, the accuracy is becoming early stabled
 and higher than method reference [10] proposed, it also can
 adapt itself and according to the historical data and collected
 data to erase the influences the evidences conflicts causes.
 Figure 4. The comparison of the accuracy
 VI. CONCLUSION
 In this article, a fuzzy ontology is proposed to model
 the fuzzy context information and fuzzy D-S theory based
 reasoning method is also presented to resolve the problem of
 uncertainty reasoning of fuzzy context. Finally an example
 scenario is demonstrated to prove the usability of the
 proposed approach, this method also can adapt itself and
 according to the historical data and collected data to erase
 the influences the evidences conflicts causes.
 But there also some areas need to be improved, first,
 when the fuzzy ontology’s scale is bigger, the performance
 of the context reasoning also need to improve, and in the
 reasoning algorithm, the method that find the most similar
 subsets need to be improved to become much efficient.
