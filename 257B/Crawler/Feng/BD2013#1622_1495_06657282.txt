Privacy, Confidentiality, and Public Utility

Abstract— Business people and academia are now excited 
about Big Data and Cloud Computing as the new and most 
innovative means for enhancing productivity and customer 
satisfaction. Simultaneously, there are strong concerns 
about privacy not only among privacy advocates but among 
consumers in general, and how to strike a right balance is 
the main theme in every field of science. However, it is quite 
strange that very little attention has been paid to the concept 
of confidentiality, which must be the core element of privacy. 
This paper first tries to analyze the following two 
dichotomies as a basis for possible policy considerations: (1) 
privacy approach in the United States versus confidentiality 
approach in the United Kingdom, though they share the 
same common law tradition, and (2) clear demarcation 
between Information Service and Telecommunications in 
the United States, dating back to the Computer Inquiry in 
the 1970s.
 This paper also analyzes the features of the Cloud and 
discusses the possibility of treating it as a new type of Public 
Utility, namely Information Utility. This hypothesis should 
be rejected, because there are crucial differences in market 
structures, regardless of clear similarities in service features. 
Instead, this paper emphasizes the necessity of protecting 
confidentiality as an industrial norm. 
Taking into account the long tradition of free market for 
computing industries, self-regulation is basically preferable 
to government regulation. But from a different viewpoint of 
“nudge”, a hybrid combination of libertarianism and 
paternalism, this paper concludes by proposing five short 
recommendations including fair contract terms as well as 
unbundling confidentiality from privacy.

I. BIG DATA FEVER
 Business people are now excited about “Big Data” 
(BD) as the new and most innovative means for enhancing 
productivity and customer satisfaction, and the term BD 
has become one of the buzz words not only in business but 
in society as a whole. 
Actually, as computing power advances quite 
astonishingly thanks to Moore’s law, the amount of data in 
our world has been exploding, and analyzing large data 
sets (BD) with 4Vs (Velocity, Volume, Veracity and 
Variety) seems to be a key basis of competition. BD is 
expected to generate new productivity growth and 
innovation–that is, new levels of business value. 
It is natural that business always seeks a new trend, but 
BD may be a kind of fever. As the world economy is 
fluctuating everywhere since the Lehman shock, there is a 
strong expectation toward new businesses as well as new 
jobs. Reportedly, BD now appears in 0.1% of all job 
listings and it is expected to double before the end of 2012, 
and to pass Hadoop as a popular term for this field of 
emerging technology [1]. 
Professors such as Brynjolfsson of MIT, a 
distinguished researcher in Information Technology (IT) 
and productivity with his colleague Andrew McAfee, 
seem to be enthusiastic about BD. They published an e-
 book titled “Race against Machine,” and tell us as follows 
in their blog [2] [3]. 
Today businesses can measure their activities and 
customer relationships with unprecedented precision. As a 
result, they are awash with data. This is particularly 
evident in the digital economy, where clickstream data 
give precisely targeted and real-time insights into 
consumer behavior.” They also say “breakthroughs in 
innovation often rely on breakthroughs in measurement.” 
But they take a hard look at the impact of acceleration of 
technology on jobs. “Our technologies are racing ahead 
but many of our skills and organizations are lagging 
behind. So it’s urgent that we understand these phenomena, 
discuss their implications and come up with strategies that 
allow human workers to race with machines instead of 
racing against them.” 
They describe themselves as “digital optimists,” and 
admit that IT tools are “greatly improving our world and 
our lives, and will continue to do so.” They put forth ideas 
for using technologies to accelerate organizational 
innovation and enhance human capital. 
II. BIG DATA AS MEANS FOR RESILIENCE
         Before addressing privacy issues, I will introduce 
some experiences about how BD can contribute to 
resilience in case of emergency, taking the 3.11 tragedy 
as an extreme example. 
      The term 3.11 is an acronym of the triple disasters 
that hit Japan two years ago, including the earthquake, the 
tsunami, and the nuclear plant accidents. It started around 
14:46 on March 11, 2011 with the M9.0 earthquake that 
covered most of the eastern half of mainland Japan, and 
was followed by a tsunami so huge as to occur only once 
every 100 years. These two were natural disasters, 
although there was criticism of earthquake prediction and 
tsunami warning ability.

      In contrast, the nuclear accident at Fukushima No. 1 
power plant operated by Tokyo Electric Power Co. was a 
mixture of natural and man-made disasters, since 
precautionary actions have protected other plants such as 
the Onagawa plant (more closely located to the epicenter 
of the earthquake) from a catastrophe. And the potential 
risk of radioactive contamination still continues. 
       During the first 48 hours after the disaster, which is 
believed to be the crucial time for rescuing victims, all 
roads were extremely congested, since some were 
destroyed, and some were overloaded with cars rushing 
toward the stricken areas. Loss of information worsened 
the situation. 
       In the midst of such chaos, some could enjoy 
navigation by Honda and Pioneer Traffic Tracing 
Systems, each of which provided congestion information 
to her subscribers respectively. One example of data 
provided on that occasion is shown in Fig. 1. While the 
subscribers receive traffic information, they also send 
their own routing data to the system, which constitutes 
BD, and shows a reliable and less-congested routing. 
       As usefulness of the data became apparent, 
information was not confined to the subscribers, but 
opened to the public via Google in cooperation with 
Toyota and Nissan, which helped those who went to the 
damaged areas by car, or some might have changed to 
other transportation means. 
       Google provided another type of aid, called Person 
Finder. In an emergency, it is sometimes difficult to make 
even a telephone call, which prevented the confirmation 
of safety even among family members. Google set up 
Person Finder as early as the evening of 3.11, and helped 
people reconnect with friends and loved ones in the 
aftermath of natural and man-made disasters. 
       The above two examples were success stories. But 
there were more failure stories than success. Japan has 
been maintaining a family registry, and it is the basic 
public record for all interactions between government and 
citizens. Tsunami flooded into several town offices and 
washed away or invalidated these records made of paper.
 But some cities could survive, because three months 
earlier copies of all records including paper documents 
were stored in another place, where tsunami did not reach. 
There is now a strong tendency toward digitizing these 
data, and storing in a Cloud, remote from the town hall.

III. PRIVACY CONCERNS
 Indeed, BD will be promising, but it is usually 
accompanied by privacy concerns on the other side of the 
same coin as symbolized by “Big Brother” [4]. Privacy 
advocates such as EPIC (Electronic Privacy Information 
Center) issue many privacy alerts including BD-related 
potential violations, and the research community is 
making every effort to develop privacy-preserving data 
mining (PPDM), privacy enhancing technology (PET), etc. 
in order to have a right balance between opportunities and 
concerns about BD. 
Academia are also trying to solve the problem; for 
example, Tene and Polinetsky [5] put BD between Big 
Benefit and Big Concerns, and call for “Big Decisions,” 
while Machanvajjhala and Reiter [6] expect “Big 
Privacy.” However, discussions tend to go on without a 
clear definition of privacy, and quite frequently, privacy is 
confused with confidentiality of private information. 
Privacy laws are usually considered in the context of 
an individual's privacy right or reasonable expectation of 
privacy, both of which are subjective rather than objective. 
Therefore, there are ever-lasting debates among legal 
scholars regarding what elements constitute privacy. 
Warren and Brandeis’ paper [7] was the first attempt, in 
which they defined privacy as “an inviolate personality” 
symbolized as “the right to be let alone.” 
Seventy years later, Professor Prosser classified 
privacy tort into four categories: unreasonable intrusion, 
disclosure of private facts, false light publicity, and 
appropriation of the other’s name or likeness [8]. We must 
add two more elements to this, since self-determination 
such as sexual orientation or contraception is admitted as 
one of the privacy elements by the supreme court (Roe v. 
Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973)), and a new right called the 
right of publicity has been developed by the lower court 
decisions (for example, Haelan Laboratories v. Topps 
Chewing Gum (2nd Cir. 202 F.2d 866 (1953)). 
Therefore, privacy is now considered to contain at 
least six sub-sets of rights as follows [9]:   self-
 determination,   unreasonable intrusion,   public 
disclosure of private facts,   false light publicity, 	
 appropriation of the other’s name or likeness, and 
 right 
of publicity. Thus, it is fairly difficult to maintain a fruitful 
discussion among people without prior specification of the 
speaker’s notion of privacy. 
In the case of BD, privacy concerns are mostly related 
to types 3 and 4., which are generally called “data 
privacy”, but still some ambiguity and confusion must be 
inevitable. The worst example of such confusion is 
illustrated in the document titled “Top Ten Big Data 
Security and Privacy Challenges” issued by Cloud 
Security Alliance (CSA) in November 2012 [10], where 
the following ten challenges are listed: 
  Secure computations in distributed programming 
frameworks,  Security best practices for non-relational 
data stores,  Secure data storage and transaction logs, 
 End-point input validation/filtering, 	  Real-time 
security/compliance monitoring, 
  Scalable and 
composable privacy-preserving data mining and analytics, 
 Cryptographically enforced access control and secure 
507
communication,  Granular access control,  Granular 
audit, and  Data provenance. 
In this analysis, if access to private data is protected by 
cryptography, we will have privacy in BD, because the 
parties are not considered as vulnerable or malicious. The 
threat model of PET for privacy is different; because it 
considers communication partners as malicious or non-
 trustworthy. 
Moreover, it is very difficult to identify which item is 
closely related to privacy. Taken as broadly as possible, 
almost all items are related, and only items 6 and 7 are 
included when you take it as narrowly as possible. That is 
partly because the term privacy itself is so ambiguous, as 
mentioned above, but the main reason lies in the attitude 
and knowledge of the author who uses the term “privacy” 
without specifying the accurate meaning. In this regard, 
even lawyers are not exceptions, not to mention laymen 
who may be innocent and exempted from any liability, but 
still confusion remains. 
In order to have a fruitful discussion, I have proposed a 
clear unbundling of terms between privacy and data 
protection [11], where the former means a semantic effect 
on personality and the latter a mere syntactical method. 
The former dispute must be settled by the courts not on the 
property rule but on the liability rule [12], whereas the 
latter may be solved by technology. 
My idea is very close to the legal system existing in 
the United States, but it is not universal. Rather, the 
European system covering the member countries of the 
European Union seems to be more prevailing due to the 
massive adopters. These two systems are contrastive in the 
following six points as shown in Table-I, among which the 
alienability concept is most important, because it is 
directly linked with separation of personal data and 
privacy.
 IV. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PRIVACY AND 
CONFIDENTIALITY
 The demarcation between personal data and privacy 
must be the first step to understand privacy as a whole. 
But a more important distinction will be the one between 
privacy and confidentiality, though usually these two 
terms are used interchangeably. 
For example, when people talk about security 
management, confidentiality is one of the top priority 
elements of CIA (confidentiality, integrity, and 
availability), and privacy protection is believed to be 
secured through confidentiality, regardless of subtle 
differences between CSA and PET mentioned above. 
However, from a legal viewpoint a quite different 
scene may arise. On one hand there is a general consensus 
that legal method or institution to secure privacy is 
gradually harmonized toward a single global standard. On 
the other hand, there exists a view that insists that the 
differences of systems and cultures still constitute an 
important factor. 
As the latter example, the conflicts between the 
European Union and the United States are frequently 
referred to as mentioned above. But it is quite strange that 
the United States and the United Kingdom show a 
contrastive attitude toward protection of confidentiality,

though they share the common law tradition as well as 
Prince Albert v. Strange in 1849 (1 McN. & G. 25), which 
was picked up as the starting case law by Warren and 
Brandeis [7]. 
As Richards and Solove [13] point out, English court 
has not changed their attitude toward privacy since 
Strange, while American legal society has been 
thoroughly influenced by Warren and Brandeis. Therefore, 
it is quite contrastive that English court keeps its tradition 
to preserve confidentiality between the confider and the 
confidant to protect privacy, whereas American courts try 
to protect privacy per se apart from confidentiality. And in 
this regard, Japan belongs to the American school. 
The differences between the two systems appear in the 
following four different layers as summarized in Table-II. 
First, privacy is quite personal and subjective, as the 
symbolic phrase “to be let alone” implies. On the contrary, 
confidentiality depends upon the relationship between the 
confider and the confidant, thus making the private nature 
of contract more visible and objective through the 
relationship. 
Second, privacy is usually as absolute as one of the 
human rights inalienable to others, though there are slight 
differences between European Union countries and the 
United States, as was shown on the occasion of the EU 
Directive safe harbor disputes [14]. Regardless of these 
slight differences, it is quite different from confidentiality, 
which fundamentally constitutes a kind of contract, taking 
for granted personal information as alienable. 
The third difference is what kind of right the victim 
may have against the injurer: in the case of privacy, the 
plaintiff may sue the injurer against the violation of his/her 
privacy as a cause of action, whereas in the case of breach 
of confidentiality, both parties of the contract may go to 
court in search of damages against the breach of contract. 
Injunction may be awarded according to the situation, but 
generally speaking it is more feasible in case of privacy, 
since violation affects moral rights. 
Last but not least, the third party effect is most 
important, but there is little difference, though the readers 
may suppose privacy is more guaranteed in terms of third 
party effect, because it is akin to property right. But 
actually, the English system of confidentiality provides a 
similar level of protection against the third party who 
breaks the confidentiality depending on whether it is 
intentionally or carelessly [15]. 
One important note before closing this section is that 
the English system may have advantages and

disadvantages as is the case with other social systems. On 
the pro side, it seems very suited to the nature of privacy, 
especially in terms of subjective as well as relational 
nature. On the con side, it has long been supported by the 
ethics of “gentleman”, which has no guarantee of efficacy 
in the civilized society [16]. 
V. DEMARCATION BETWEEN INFORMATION SERVICE 
AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
 Now we will move to the next issue: who will be the 
major players in the BD business, and how to treat them in 
order to enhance benefits as well as reduce concerns. 
In previous days, the database business was 
constructed mainly by data creators or data gatherers. For 
example, the Chemical Abstract was created, operated and 
maintained by the American Chemical Society, which is 
an association of big users of this database. The same 
thing can be said of airline reservation systems, where 
alliances of airliners are eager to gain competitive 
advantages against other alliances. 
But the situation has been fairly changed in the 
environment of ubiquitous computing and reliable 
outsourcing. Today, many firms engaging in IT-related 
business are collecting and accumulating BD through the 
daily process of their business. Meanwhile, corporations 
other than IT-related areas are focusing on their core 
competences and entrusting IT-related businesses to third 
parties. Thus, main players in BD will be IT-related 
companies such as Google, Amazon, ISPs, and 
telecommunications carriers. 
Indeed, there is a green field of information services, 
where various kinds of existing industries as well as ones 
quite different from the traditional industry category 
compete. However, legal treatment cannot keep pace with 
these rapid changes effectively, but instead stick to the 
traditional categorization. Here, the most important and 
still influential market demarcation is one between 
telecommunications and information services. 
In the early 1970s, recognizing the convergence of 
computers and telecommunications, the FCC (Federal 
Communications Commission) started the Computer 
Inquiry. It was a duty for the FCC to decide whether she 
has jurisdiction over information services according to the 
prescriptions by the Constitution (FCC’s role is limited to 
interstate communications). But more important 
background was that she tried to establish a right balance 
in terms of regulation between the two promising 
computer-related industries. 
After struggling to draw a clear line between the two 
by new concepts such as hybrid processing and hybrid 
communications, the task was forwarded to the next 
inquiry. In 1980, the FCC adopted a new policy by 
Computer Inquiry: the basic principle is the distinction 
between Basic and Enhanced services, where the former is 
subject to regulations by the FCC, while the latter is free 
from any governmental regulations. 
This dichotomy is essentially maintained by the 
Communications Act of 1996 (Amendment to 
Communications Act of 1934) with the slight change of 
the names–Telecommunications and Information services. 
Thus, it is confirmed again that information service is free 
from governmental intervention. In other words, computer 
industries both in manufacturing and in services are and 
have been “free markets”. 
VI. CLOUD AS PUBLIC UTILITY?
 The above-mentioned situation is almost the same at 
least in the developed economies, and now the typical 
provision of computer-network power is called “Cloud”. 
Cloud is another kind of buzz word, but its concept is 
shared among computer professionals. NIST (National 
Institute for Standards and Technology) defines cloud as 
follows with a short reservation that these definitions, 
attributes, and characteristics will evolve and change over 
time: 
“Cloud computing is a model for enabling convenient, 
on-demand network access to a shared pool of 
configurable computing resources (e.g., networks, servers, 
storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly 
provisioned and released with minimal management effort 
or service provider interaction.” [17] 
While the NIST definition is generally accepted, few 
people recognize that cloud service resembles the public 
utility in terms of security features entrusted to the 
provider, dubbed as CIA. Section 3542 of 44 USC (Public 
printing and documents) prescribes “information security” 
and CIA as follows: 
“the term ‘information security’ means protecting 
information and information systems from unauthorized 
access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or 
destruction in order to provide—(A) integrity, which 
means guarding against improper information 
modification or destruction, and includes ensuring 
information non-repudiation and authenticity; (B) 
confidentiality, which means preserving authorized 
restrictions on access and disclosure, including means for 
protecting personal privacy and proprietary information; 
and (C) availability, which means ensuring timely and 
reliable access to and use of information.” 
These descriptions are technology-oriented but if you 
look at them carefully, you can realize some similarities 
with my previous explanations about confidentiality in a 
legal sense. If company A entrusts a Cloud company B 
with all transactions regarding A’s main product C, they 
usually contract about detailed terms and conditions about 
information regarding product, transactions and other 
related ones such as customer data, personal data and so 
on. In this regard, A will be a confider and B will be a 
confidant regarding the information concerned. 
509
However, the novelty of Cloud Computing is offering 
on-demand access to unlimited, shared computing 
resources as software services with standardized interfaces, 
which may lead to disappearing security domains. 
Therefore, enforcement of CIA on control and data flow is 
a challenge within and between external services. 
Regarding privacy, aggregation of personal data at cloud 
services makes secondary usage of personal data for 
statistics interesting due to sufficient (in statistics and in 
real-time monitoring) available amount of data. 
Here are two important facts implied: First, Cloud is 
now a necessary and convenient tool for corporations to 
do business. Second, the longer A uses B’s service, the 
more difficult for A to quit and change to the other Cloud, 
by the effect of lock-in or high switching cost, though 
transferability is propagated as one of the most appealing 
points. These characteristics are shared among so-called 
“Public Utility”, ranging from energy supply (electricity 
and gas), transportation (railway, bus and truck), and 
communications (postal service, telecommunications) 
networks, which are subject to governmental regulation. 
The leading case for public utility was an early 
decision by the US Supreme Court in Munn v. Illinois (94 
U.S. 113 (1877)), dealing with corporate rates and 
agriculture. The Munn case allowed states to regulate 
certain businesses including railroads (mostly rate 
regulation) within their borders, and is commonly 
regarded as a milestone in the growth of federal 
government regulation. This decision was reexamined by 
Wabash Case (Wabash, St. Louis & Pacific Railway 
Company v. Illinois, 118 U.S. 557 (1886)), which severely 
limited the rights of states to control interstate commerce. 
It led to the creation of the Interstate Commerce 
Commission, the ancestor of the FCC. 
As early as the late 1960s, at the dawn of real-time 
computing, Sprague [18] proposed to regard information 
service as a new type of public utility. His point was that 
some regulations are necessary regarding non-
 discriminatory treatment to customers including non-
 discriminatory tariffs. And there are many authors who 
describe Cloud as having similar features, though most of 
them are indifferent to regulation. 
Although significant similarity between public utility 
and Cloud lies in their service features, as decided by the 
Munn case such as “public convenience and necessity” 
essential to daily operation, the market structure is quite 
different as summarized in Table-III (comparison is 
limited to common carrier type utility). In the case of 
public utility, the market inevitably becomes a natural 
monopoly at least in the local areas due to huge lump sum 
investment with increasing returns. Therefore, government 
intervention is justified to protect consumers from abuse 
of monopolist’s power. But in the case of Cloud, such a 
monopoly is not an inevitable outcome, but a result of  
fierce competition as indicated in the investigations by the
 DOJ in the Microsoft case. 
Thus public utility hypothesis for Cloud should be 
rejected, but there is a strong concern about confidentiality 
as mentioned above. I think this concern should be 
regulated by a neutral instrument such as the independent 
administrative commission or the commissioner, 
regardless whether or not Cloud is a public utility. The 
secrecy of communications is the severest case.

 VII. NUDGE RATHER THAN REGULATION
 Before closing, I will list some short policy 
recommendations on what the legal structure should be 
regarding Cloud, which deals with Big Data on a daily 
basis.
 First, self-regulation is preferable to government 
regulation, especially when we take into account that 
computer industries have successfully grown without any 
governmental intervention. But as the harmonization of 
the legal system is a requisite in the global economy, I will 
promote a new way of self-regulation called “nudge”, 
proposed by Thaler and Sunstein [19]. As it is a mixture of 
libertarianism and paternalism, it requires a subtle balance 
between the two elements, but still seems promising. 
Second, if a minimum enactment is necessary under 
the “nudge” principle, it would be how to deal with unfair 
contract terms. Of course there exist some protections for 
consumers, but in the case of BD and Cloud, would-be 
victims are not only consumers but corporations including 
small and start-up businesses. An English act named 
Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 may be a good example, 
and the Japanese government is now making effort to 
insert a similar clause into the 100 year-old civil code. 
Third, we should investigate carefully what types of 
protection is fit for information goods. While we are 
familiar with property-type protection such as intellectual 
property, how to protect confidential information is still 
under-investigated. Most countries criminalize the stealing 
of tangible goods, but how to deal with intangibles is not 
yet fixed. No country criminalizes stealing of information 
regardless of content, but only a few criminalize stealing 
of personal data under limited conditions. And there are 
large differences in how to preserve secrecy of 
communications even among developed economies. 
Fourth, as the first step of the above-mentioned 
investigation we should focus our effort on the 
relationship between privacy and confidentiality, which 
seems to me a main cause of confusion. In this regard, my 
510
proposal is to unbundle data protection from privacy. The 
English concept of confidentiality, treated as relation 
rather than substance, is informative here. 
Finally, in relation to secrecy of communications, it 
would be another topic of interest how to establish a level 
playing field for all IT-related industries, especially 
between information service and telecommunications. We 
may need Computer Inquiry  in the very near future.
