Abstract— The advent of Big Data analytics is changing some 
of the current knowledge paradigms in Science as well in 
Industry. Although, the term and some of the core methodologies 
have been around for many years, the continuous price reduction 
of hardware and some services (e.g. cloud computing) are 
making more affordable the application of these methodologies to 
almost any Research Area being developed in Academic 
Institutions or Company Research Centers. This growing 
popularity is also raising some concerns regarding some of its 
core concepts and the way Data is treated through the analysis 
process. It is the aim of this paper to address these concerns 
because big Data Methodologies will be extensively use in the new 
ICT Agriculture project granted by NEDO, in order to improve 
the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed system, therefore it is 
necessary to establish a common background for all the project 
members in which Sojo University plays a fundamental role in 
the improvement of the general performance of the proposed 
system. 
Keywords—Big Data; Computer Science; Data Systems; Data 
Analysis 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Big Data is currently an emerging topic among different 
researchers like: computer scientists, economists, 
mathematicians, political scientists, bio-informaticists, 
sociologists and many others who are claiming that the results 
of Big Data analysis are richer results than standard analysis so 
far done in their areas. [1] 
The concept behind Big Data can be simplified as the 
analysis of a wide variety of data volume towards the intention 
to find a regular pattern or data behavior that will allow making 
decisions in a faster and more accurate way [2].  
Although, some authors consider the term Big Data poor, 
the term is used in science to refer to data sets large enough to 
require supercomputers for their analysis, even though 
currently, vast sets of data can be analyzed on powerful but 
affordable, desktop computers with standard open software 
tools [6]. We believe and agree that data intensive applications 
represent a challenge for Big Data, like the LCH (Large 
Hadron Collider), but for most organizations processing large 
volumes or wide varieties of data remains merely a 
technological solution unless it is tied to business/research 
goals and objectives [2, 3, 4].  
Furthermore, Big Data is important because it refers to the 
analytical phenomenon that is a current trend in academia and 
industry. It is the phenomenon around Big Data what we want 
to address [5]. There are several issues around Big Data but in 
this paper we will focus on: Data availability, Security, Ethics, 
Big Data Results’ Interpretation, Data set equivalence, and Big 
Data main applications scenarios. 
In particular for the objective of the application of Big Data 
in our research, it is necessary to define our research spectrum 
towards Big Data since the data set in which we will apply its 
concepts and analysis methodologies will be taken from a new 
project that is being implemented by NEDO in Japan in which 
Sojo University is an active research member in the group.  
The main target of this paper is to discuss the biggest Big 
Data issues not only from the technological point of view, but 
how the decisions made using this complex group of 
methodologies could affect our concept of knowledge. We will 
apply in the best possible manner the concepts shown in this 
paper to our project in order to accomplish the best results but 
at the same time ensuring the user confidence in our system 
through a strong ethical behavior. 
II. MAIN BI G DATA CONCERNS 
A. Data Availanilty 
Today we use social networking for almost all of our daily 
activities i.e. Google, Facebook, Twitter, Flickr, etc. These 
sites generate large amount of Data everyday in which it could 
be included our personal information (depending on the 
Security privacy measures we have taken on our own 
accounts); which generates  a problem we address later; among 
other information related to our activities, opinions, posts, 
activities, etc. This information could be retrieved using 
different APIs (Application Program Interface) provided by 
these sites in order to allow any researcher or any person to 
retrieve specific data from the large data set this companies 
have. But, the amount and the quality of the retrieved 
information is not the expected since these APIs are under 
control of the previous mentioned companies. In avergae ony 
1% of the public twitts are available through these APIs [7].  
Above of all, these sample data is only available to some 
companies and startups, but only few researchers have access 
to this information. The same behavior is observed in the rest 
of the so called “big” companies in the Internet, making the 
data not representative of the Universe which it belongs. 
261
B. Security 
Security is a general underestimated area in almost all 
Information Technology areas, reactive could be the closest 
word to describe the kind of behavior companies have towards 
security threats all around the world. In the particular case of 
Big Data, Security is strongly related to the protection of user’s 
privacy. Private user information in the Universe of the Social 
Media and its relation with other accounts the users have in 
other sites could generate a “pattern” or “behavior” [6]. 
In the recent decade the number of attacks related to steal 
user’s information increased dramatically and it will continue 
growing since the social engineering methodologies are 
becoming more aggressive and companies do not change their 
behavior towards information security. 
C. Ethics 
While Big Data is an emerging trend, there is a little 
understanding about the ethical implications on the research 
being done. A very good example is the case of a research done 
in Harvard in 2006, in which a collection of colleagues’ 
Facebook profiles were used to make a study of how was their 
friendships and interests over time [9].  The collected data was 
publicly released to other researches to conduct experiments on 
that, but they realized it was possible to de-anonymize part of 
the data set. 
It is important that scholars reflect on the importance of 
accountability in order to act in ethical manner. Regarding Big 
Data, accountability is strongly related to their research field as 
well as to their research subjects. 
Being accountable for a specific action will entitle to 
specific set of rules that must be kept in mind in any step done 
towards the realization of the research specific goals and 
objectives [2, 4]. Those characteristics make accountability a 
broader concept than privacy [6]. 
D. Big Data Results’ Interpretation 
“As a large mass of information, Big Data is not self 
explanatory. And yet the specific methodologies for 
interpreting the data are open to sort of technological and 
philosophical debate. Can the data represent an “objective 
truth” or is any interpretation necessarily biased by some 
subjective filter or the way the data is “cleaned” [11]” 
All researchers are interpreters of data [12, 13]. We could 
observe every organization has its own non-standardize way to 
figure data and they way this must be represented. From the 
technological point of view, Big Data performs its analysis 
using tools that are freely available in the internet such us: R, 
Hadoop, Pig, etc, together with some statistical analysis that 
could shape the date the ways the researcher want it. Big 
Data’s result interpretation must be done with the less possible 
bias in order to keep an ethical behavior towards them. 
E. Data Set Equivalence 
Some researchers have the assumption that analytical 
methodologies done in small data sets can be applied in the 
same manner to Big Data, which in some specific scenarios can 
be done, but following the general knowledge of Big Data 
those analysis can not be applied. We could describe this issue 
in two parts: 
 “Cleaning” Process of collected Data.  
Once Data is collected there are plenty of  “no interesting” 
data that must be “cleaned”, but preserving the integrity of the 
useful Data. [8]. 
Metadata Generation.  
Assuming that the former point was successfully 
accomplished, the next step is the generation of the best 
descriptive metadata possible. The most important points that 
metadata must describe are how it is recorded and measured. 
Since every single research topic have its own particularities 
regarding to data collection, an agreement regarding which 
data format will be used (or if this must be created) must be 
decided prior to the metadata generation or, if possible, to the 
data collection. 
Having different research scientific topics and its relation 
with industry, makes even more difficult the decision of the 
format to be used for the metadata generation. An important 
issue here is data provenance. It is necessary to know where 
the data was generated in order to trace forward and backwards 
its accountability [6]. Having different metadata from different 
sources and trying to find its correspondence with another data 
set represent a big challenge due to the lack of standardization 
showed before, and trying to find a correlation between two 
different data set formats could affect the granularity needed to 
get the best results of the applied analysis. 
III. BIG DATA APPLICATIONS 
At present, Big Data methodologies are being applied in 
very different science and industry applications, from computer 
science to Marketing and Industrial Management. Elsevier’s 
“Research Trends” 2012 publication shows the different 
publications statistics found under the “Big Data” keyword see 
Figure 1. We could observe that regarding scientific papers the 
biggest number of publications correspond to Computer 
Science and the least Art and Humanities [1].  
Regarding industry, the most common applications of Big 
Data are: Supply Chain Management, Security and Access 
Control, Work in Process Tracking, Consumer Applications, 
Asset Management, Environmental Applications, Finance, 
Smart Grid, etc. Due to the wide range that is possible to be 
applied, Big Data is becoming a recurrent name in the biggest 
business areas in the world. A consequence of that recent 
popularity is the new born term “Data Scientist” [14]. 
IV. CURRENT SCOPE OF ICT AGRICULTURE IN JAPAN 
ICT Agriculture was born in the “Tunis Agenda for the 
Information Society", and since, Japan has been playing an 
active role towards the design and implementation of the 
required technologies to be applied in ICT Agriculture [15]. 
Academia, as well as Company Research Centers, has been 
actively working on this topic due to its importance in Japan. 
Researchers in Academia focus their approach towards the 
design of custom systems, which will allow them [16]:

Fig. 1. Subject areas researching Big Data, Elsevier’s Research Trends 
1. Field monitoring (numerical data acquisition, detailed 
image-capturing system) 
2. Construction of a Data Acquisition System 
These custom made systems, will later be linked to the 
Japan Meteorological Agency for further crosscheck analysis. 
These are based on the farmer’s expertise, which will give the 
core information the system designer or integrator, which will 
decide the different sensors, networks and data format. Further, 
the generated data will be stored in Data Bases for further 
analysis, in which case different visualization software 
packages could be used. 
In the case of Company Research Centers they decided to 
pursue a wider approach in which not only the technical 
approach was tackled but also the Management Area as well as 
the business concerns from the producer point of view and the 
market point of view. In this case, retailers are considered the 
market, and other problems are shown as well, as the 
increasing elderly population that affects agriculture because 
there is no person to transmit the accumulated know-how [17, 
18]. 
Although, both approaches could use the advantages of Big 
Data methodologies, there are some issues regarding its 
application: 
1. In the case of Academic Institutions, the need of a 
multidisciplinary team could increase the cost and complexity 
of the project, in which case, a re-engineering could be 
necessary in order to define specific research objectives the 
working group could work on, not focusing their efforts only in 
the ICT Agriculture but in different Big Data applications 
related to society 
2. In the case of Company Research Institutions, 
although they could have much more resources than Academic 
Institutions, their cost is still high for a market such Agriculture 
in which the instability of their yearly production, that could be 
affected by external factors, could badly affect their budget 
projections making this Company based Big Data application 
not affordable. Moreover, the investment made, if it’s made, 
must be comprehensible for the farmer or farmer community; 
also the farmer must understand completely the scenario in 
which its information will work and how it will work, 
something that could be difficult to achieve due to the unique 
characteristics of the target group. 
V. THE NEDO PROJECT 
NEDO (New Energy and Industrial Technology 
Development Organization) in Japan is the Governmental 
Organization in charge of the promotion of addressing energy 
and global environmental problems, and the enhancement of 
Japan’s Industrial competitiveness, through research and 
development, not only in Japanese territory but also abroad. 
Currently, NEDO is the largest Research and Development 
organization in Japan that invested in different research and 
development projects, from Energy to the resolution of various 
issues [19]. 
In the case of this project, the main target is to create a 
system that could provide healthy food suggestions to the user 
and, if the user decides, provide as well the food he/she will 
require for their daily needs. 
The system is a conglomerate of farmers, transportation 
companies and restaurants that will generate a considerable 
amount of data. The objective is to use Big Data analysis 
methodologies in order find specific patterns that could 
improve the efficiency and accuracy of the food suggestion 
system. Due to the work group in which this project is being 
done, each active member of the group has a different and 
specific task. 
Therefore, the cost included for this project could be less 
compared to research initiatives in Academia and Company 
Research Institutions. So far the project is in its beginning, and 
we are foreseeing all the necessary details for its correct 
development. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
Since the project is in its beginning stage it must consider 
every Big Data aspect as well as its issues and trends. 
Big Data, being a relative new trend, must be used 
according to the highest ethical behavior in order to ensure the 
user confidence towards any Big Data Application 
We must ensure the privacy and data protection towards the 
end user to strength the link between the different actors of the 
NEDO Big Data project 
The different data sets that will be used in the project must 
be standardized in order to avoid loosing granularity 
The results of the analysis must be just a part of the global 
and multidisciplinary analysis towards the improvement of the 
general recommendation made by the system. 
ICT Agriculture in Japan (usually consider  under the 
“Sensor Networks” research) has been a trend topic due to the 
263
diverse factors that could affect harvest and the supply chain 
between producers and retailers. The developed initiatives, 
academic and company research based ones, have common 
objectives towards the improvement of the quality of the 
harvest as well to improve the profit the producer could make 
if all external factors could be predicted and avoided. 
Research being done in Academic centers and Companies 
are facing specific problems regarding to their particular 
characteristics. In the case of Academic research the need of 
multidisciplinary team and the temporal characteristic of the 
projects could jeopardize the continuity of their projects. In the 
case of Research done in Companies, their main disadvantage 
is the cost that the farmer must pay in order to use the service.  
Farmers have been facing some difficulties regarding their 
business because of the weather change, price instability and 
constant financial problems due to foreign competition. 
Therefore, an expensive service like this could be only 
available to big producers in which case, markets are 
completely ensured for a long period of time. 
The current NEDO project involves different specialized 
members that could improve drastically the output of the 
mentioned system without increasing its cost or causing 
external issues to the farmer or to the restaurants involved. 
Therefore, the NEDO project have a competitive advantage 
if compared to current academic or company based research. 
Handling the user’s Data with the highest ethical behavior 
will ensure the user’s confidence on the system and it will 
create a reliable environment towards the success of the 
project. 
The next step in the project is the creation of the common  
platform as well as the algorithm design and analysis strategy.
