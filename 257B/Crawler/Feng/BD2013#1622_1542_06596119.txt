 Big Data: A Scientific Visualization Perspective
 Charles (Chuck) Hansen 
SCI Institute Professor of Computer Science, University of Utah
 Abstract
 Modern high performance computers have speeds measured 
in petaflops and handle data set sizes measured in terabytes 
and petabytes. In the next decade (or less) we will see exascale 
computational resources. Although these machines offer enor-
 mous potential for solving very large-scale realistic computa-
 tional problems, their effectiveness will hinge upon the ability 
of human experts to interact with their simulation results and 
extract useful information. One of the greatest scientific chal-
 lenges of the 21st century is to effectively understand and 
make use of the vast amount of information being produced. 
Visual data analysis will be among our most important tools in 
helping to understand such large-scale information.
 Bio
 Charles (Chuck) Hansen is an IEEE Fellow and a Professor 
of Computer Science in the School of Computing and an 
Associate Director of the Scientific Computing and Imaging 
Institute at the University of Utah.
 He received a BS in computer science from Memphis State 
University in 1981 and a PhD in computer science from the 
University of Utah in 1987. Since 1998, he has been on the 
faculty in Computer Science at the University of Utah. He was 
a visiting professor at the University Joseph Fourier Grenoble 
in 2011-2012 and a visiting scientist at INRIA-Rhone Alpes 
in the GRAVIR group in 2004-2005. From 1997 to 1998, he 
was a Research Associate Professor in Computer Science at the 
University of Utah. From 1989 to 1997, he was a Technical 
Staff Member in the Advanced Computing Laboratory 
(ACL) located at Los Alamos National Laboratory, where he 
formed and directed the visualization efforts in the ACL. He 
was a Bourse de Chateaubriand PostDoc Fellow at INRIA, 
Rocquencourt France, in 1987 and 1988.
 Chuck Hansen has published over 140 peer reviewed 
journal and conference papers and has been a co-author on 
three papers recognized with “Best Paper Awards” at the 
IEEE Visualization Conference (1998, 2001, 2002). He was 
co-author on the Best Paper at IEEE Pacific Visualization 
2010. He was awarded the IEEE Technical Committee on 
Visualization and Graphics “Technical Achievement Award” 
in 2005 in recognition of seminal work on tools for under-
 standing large-scale scientific data sets.
 He has been Associate Editor in Chief of IEEE 
Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics and is 
currently an Associate Editor. His research has made contribu-
 tions to the fields of scientific visualization, computer graphics, 
parallel computation and computer vision.
