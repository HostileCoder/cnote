 Abstract—This paper deals with admission control in wireless 
networks such as WiMAX or LTE. Because of the limited 
sources, available bandwidth has to be used effectively. In case, 
where multimedia traffic is considered, each type of service has 
different requirements for transmission rate and delay. The 
frequency band has to be divided between several service 
streams. In this paper, five basic types of service will be 
considered: voice, videophone, data, videoconference and IPTV. 
These services have big deviations in transmission rates and 
delay requirements. Fuzzy logic was chosen as an admission 
control method, because of its flexibility and simplicity. It will be 
shown, that only few input parameters are needed to get good 
result. Designed model describes situation, where new connection 
wants to enter to the cell. The base station considers whether or 
not to accept connections according to service requirements and 
actual cell load. Main goal is using bandwidth effectively and 
avoiding cell overload. 
Keywords: Fuzzy Logic, Admission Control, dropping probability, 
wireless networks 
I. INTRODUCTION
 Bandwidth of each cell is limited. One base station can 
process finite number of access requests. Nowadays, each 
network has to handle several types of services. Base station 
should permit access for each incoming connection, meet 
required connection conditions and prevent congestion. To 
achieve all of these, bandwidth management has to be 
designed well. Admission control serves for this purpose. 
There is lot of admission control methods, for example 
measurement based or diffusion method. Most of them have 
lots of constraints in their applications. From some methods 
we can get good results for specific network type but 
unsatisfactory for another. Fuzzy logic is universal admission 
control method for various networks types and it is able to 
meet all requirements of quality for several multimedia 
services. It has low computation complexity, because the 
decision is made at the point of entrance to the network, which 
in wireless technologies is entrance to the cell. Fuzzy logic 
does not monitor stream variations. Admission decision is 
made once at the beginning. Then agreed transmission 
conditions are guaranteed. 
Every admission control method has to meet effective 
bandwidth utilization, because of limited frequency band, and 
congestion prevention. With rising number of multimedia 
applications and users, these two features are going to be more 
and more important. Furthermore, admission control method 
has to deal with some uncertainty as we cannot certainly 
predict a way how a transmission quality will change and how 
many users will be willing to enjoy a bandwidth. That is why 
we chose fuzzy logic as the admission control method. 
First part of the article describes transmission model, 
technical specifications and services requirements. Then the 
fuzzy logic based admission control model will be designed. 
Next the performance parameters will be presented to evaluate 
efficiency of designed model. The transmission model as well 
as fuzzy logic model is programmed in Matlab. Work outputs
 are presented through several simulations and obtained results 
are evaluated in final part of the article. 
II. TRANSMISSION MODEL
 Transmission model is designed for WiMAX technology as 
several ongoing streams of one cell with bandwidth 4MHz. 
New connections with their service specifications ask for 
admission. Base station has to make decision whether it is 
possible to handle new connection according to actual 
situation in cell. Channel is divided to 50 sub-channels with 
OFDM (orthogonal frequency divided multiplex) access and 
TDD (time divided duplex) or FDD (frequency divided duplex) 
multiplex. Each sub-channel uses ACM (adaptive coding 
modulation) coding scheme chosen according to SNR (signal 
to noise ration). One coding scheme is used in one frame 
duration because of this assumption the transmission 
conditions are stable during this period [1].  
Queue is described by number of PDUs x in queue size of 
X. Unit arrival process has batch behavior described by v and 
maximum value A. 
The model can process various types of services and it can 
be deployed  to the modern wireless networks such as 
WiMAX and LTE. Transmission requirements of used 
multimedia services are described in ITU-T recommendation 
in Table I. [1]. 
III. FUZZY LOGIC ADMISSION CONTROL MODEL
 Admission control model (shown in Fig. 1) is composed of 
3 similar parts. Each part contains block with input values and

block, where fuzzy rules [4] are applied. First, input values are 
fuzzyfied, from now it is possible to work with them in fuzzy 
logic environment. Next, fuzzy rules are used to make partial 
decision. An output of one decision block serves as an input 
for next one. In first two parts, the transmission conditions of 
new connection, such as required rate, delay and channel 
quality are processed. In final part, the arriving connection 
admission decision is made according to actual situation in the 
cell. At the end, an output of third decision block is 
deffuzyfed and final decision is applied.

Incoming connection can inform base station about their 
transmission requirements such as: 
‚ ? – transmission rate 
‚ ?p – peak transmission rate 
‚ Pp – peak transmission rate probability 
‚ dreq – delay requirement 
These input requirements are fuzzyfied and the affiliation 
degree is assigned to fuzzy function. For this purpose the 
Gaussian curve and generalized bell membership functions are 
used. Then the fuzzy rules described in Table II – Table IV 
are applied onto fuzzy values. Rules decision logic used the 
Boolean AND operator. The centroid method is chosen as a 
decision method. Generalized bell and sigmoidal membership 
functions are used in Fig. 2 – Fig. 10. to describe input 
affiliation degree of input values and output decisions, 
inspired by publication [3]. 
There is multimedia traffic in the cell so an incoming 
connection can require various type of service. According to 
this assumption, rates and peak rates are random values 
generated with Poisson probability from 5 intervals. Each 
interval is related to type of service listed in the Table I.

connection

connection

 When the rate, peak rate and probability of peak rate are 
randomly chosen and fuzzy rules are applied, traffic intensity 
decision for new connection is made.  
Delay requirements as well as mean SNR values are also 
generated randomly. This randomness preserves stochastic

attribute of connections. According to traffic intensity, delay 
requirement and mean SNR, estimation of necessary number 
of subchannels is made. According to these values, a required 
number of subchanels are estimated. Then, an output of the 
second block and used as an input of the following, where the 
final decision is made.  
The last decision block compares required number of sub-
 channels with actual cell situation and decides whether it has 
enough sources to handle this new connection.

 IV. SYSTEM PERFORMANCE
 Three basic parameters serve as system performance 
evaluation: 
1) PDU dropping probability: It is the most important 
parameter, because it has been proved that connection 
avoidance is better choice than set-up connection with poor 
quality and high number of dropped PDUs from user point of 
view. 
2) Throughput: This parameter depends on transmission 
rate and PDU dropping probability. It expresses the number of 
PDUs transmitted in one frame
 ? ? ??? ? ??????,  (1) 
3) Average delay: It means average number of PDUs in 
queue with respect to throughput. Little’s law [5] is used as 
follows:

where ®? is average number of PDUs in queue.

 PDU dropping probability is going to be closer described in 
this part. It is the ratio of average number of dropped PDUs

 Symbol j represents the number of arriving PDUs, but in 
this case takes only two values as total number of PDUs in the 
queue increases by v at every arrival phase. 
Information source can be described as MMPP in steady-
 state with probability π(x,s) [6], with only two phases s (the 
traffic source transmitting with normal and peak rate). Each 
sub-channel as Nakagami-m channel model [7].
 Behaviour of PDUs in queue describes transmission matrix, 
published in [8], [9] and [10].

 Matrix is divided to three parts. First part is related to 
situation, when buffer has enough capacity for incoming 
PDUs. PDUs arrival rate is lower than queue serving rate and 
no PDU has to be dropped.  
Second part describes situation, when PDUs arrival rate is 
close to queue serving rate. Buffer is on the edge of their 
capacity, but as in the previous case, no PDU has to be 
dropped. 
Third part it the most interesting part, because it describes 
queue situation, when buffer is full and PDUs have to be 
dropped. Queue is more and more congested. 
V. SIMULATION
 Simulation results describe two typical situations. First, no 
connection has to be rejected and second some connections

have to be rejected or accepted with constrains. The 
connection is called to be accepted with constrains when  this 
connection has to reduce its transmission requirements if it 
wants to be admitted. 
It is obvious, that there is strong relation between figures 
describing PDU dropping probability and admission control 
probability (Fig. 11 and 12). It is clear to see, that no 
connection has to be rejected, just some of them are accepted 
with constrains on Figure 12. The PDU dropping probability 
is lower than 1.5% in this case. In comparison with Table I., 
which describes various service types, most of them have 1% 
tolerance of dropped PDU. It can be said, that transmission 
meets the requirements. This simulation has shown, that most 
of the connections have throughput about 200Kbit/s and lower, 
SNR was between 14-22 and delay about 200ms. These values 
allow all connections to be accepted. There are no big 
deviations, which could cause rejection. 
Fig. 11 PDU dropping probability with increasing number of connection 
in case, when no connection has to be rejected. 
Fig. 12 Admission control probability with increasing number of 
connections in case, when no connection has to be rejected. 
The second case presents rejection of 14th connection, 
because of its poor channel quality. Additional input values of 
this connection have average distribution without bigger 
deviation, so it’s obvious, that the poor channel quality causes 
rejection of 14th connection.

in case, when one connection has to be rejected 
Fig. 14 Admission control probability with increasing number of 
connections in case, when one connection has to be rejected 
Fig. 15 Mean SNR dependence on increasing number of connections
 Connection rejection can be also caused by low delay 
requirement, when additional input values are without high 
deviations as it is shown on figures below. 
Note that, extreme values can cause connection rejection 
only in case, when the cell needs to avoid congestion. It is 
important to know, that the cell serves several connections, 
which have been accepted before and they have to be treated 
on the basis of agreed quality of service. New connection 
cannot affect ongoing connections.  
The third typical case of connection rejection is high 
transmission rate. This case is clear and so it is not presented 
in this article.

VI. CONCLUSION
 Each admission control model should meet connection 
requirements, prevent congestion and provide bandwidth 
efficiency with low computation complexity. It can be 
concluded, that all of these requirements were met. Incoming 
connections were evaluated individually according to their 
type of service. Final decision was made based on the number 
of necessary subchannels and real-time cell load. The system 
performance evaluation is based on PDU dropping probability, 
throughput and average delay. Simulations of PDU dropping 
probability reached really low values, which means, that 
simulation proved that connection requirements were met. 
 In case, where the cell was close to congestion and 
some of the incoming connections required extreme parameter 
values, such as high transmission rate, low SNR or delay 
requirement, these connection requests had to be rejected.  
 Fuzzy logic as admission control method brings big 
advantages. Model like this can be implemented in to various 
network service types. In comparison to method based on 
measurements, fuzzy logic is much more flexible and has 
lower computation complexity. In most cases, the channel is 
described by inaccuracy parameters. Another admission 
control methods cannot calculate and make decision with this 
inaccuracy. It gives good results with high efficiency and 
application flexibility, which is the main feature of fuzzy logic.
