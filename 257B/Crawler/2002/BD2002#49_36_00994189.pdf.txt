Trust, on the Internet, is headed for an all time 
low.  Recent events throughout the world have 
caused people to become very circumspect 
when it comes to transacting business over 
electronic media.  Without the ability to trust in 
the scrupulous behavior on both ends of a 
transaction, most prudent e-commerce 
operators and clients may decide to forgo the 
use of the Internet and revert back to old 
methods of doing business.  To counter this 
trend, the issues of network security on the 
Internet must be constantly reviewed and 
appropriate countermeasures devised.  At the 
same time, security measures must be 
appropriately devised so that they do not 
inhibit or in any way dissuade the intended e-
commerce operation.  As the use of wireless 
technology grows, the number of events and 
the far reaching effects of network security 
problems are likely to have an even larger 
impact on e-commerce. 
 
The security issues that need to be dealt with in 
e-commerce are very much the same as those 
occurring in the Internet in general.  Similarly, 
the issues affecting the e-commerce of 
universities also effects the .coms and most 
others commercial enterprises using the web.  
This session will focus on the types of security 
problems that can occur, the solutions for 
known problems, and strategies for 
circumventing these problems in the future.  
These include:  
• Establishing and implementing 
minimum-security requirements in an e-
commerce environment. 
• Security breach detection and recovery: 
mechanisms to detect when critical data 
has been altered and knowing when to 
rollback to recovery data. 
• Internet security education: training 
network developers and engineers how 
to design more secure systems. 
• Network performance issues related to 
the use of security measures. 
• Ensuring confidence in network 
security in order to alleviate client 
reservations towards using e-commerce. 
• Certification of security compliant 
network appliances and how this 
process might affect use of the Internet. 
• System software design that 
incorporates appropriate security 
mechanisms beneficial to e-commerce. 
• Operating system security 
• Secure transactions and 
authentication/authorization. 
 
Attendees are challenged to interact with 
presenters to seek out strategies that apply to 
their own network environments.  Discussions 
initiated in this venue promise to produce a 
continuing channel of communication between 
those who participate.
