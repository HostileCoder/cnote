’ The business landscape has been radically changed
since the advent of the Internet. The Internet has opened
new opportunities for companies to revamp existing Elec-
tronic Data Interchange (EDI) systems and introduce new
business models. In particular, the integration of business
processes across increasingly fluid boundaries of companies
into virtual enterprises, can be potentially greatly eased by
relying on the Internet as the business backbone.
Virtual enterprises constitute temporary, location-
independent consortia aimed towards a shared goal. These
networked organizations do not only integrate their value
chain to increase the customer-perceived added-value, but
also typically share their resources in a more efficient way
then before. This new paradigm of doing business demands
integration of existing legacy systems, packaged software
(ERP systems) and newly developed component based en-
terprise systems. Integration of these various technolo-
gies is far from trivial. Organizations attempting to inte-
grate their systems across the value chain are facing com-
plex issues such as integrating enterprise models, seman-
tic interoperability, definition of interfaces and interchange
standards, wrapping legacy system components, and, im-
plementing secure and reliable distributed transactions in
such highly distributed and hybrid component-based envi-
ronments.
Recently, various methodologies, architectures and tech-
nologies that have emerged to address these requirements.
These include: OMG’s Model Driven Architecture (MDA),
middleware standards (SOAP, CORBA), message broker
architectures, cross-organizational workflow management
systems, business object frameworks, wrapper technolo-
gies, interface standards such as WSDL, SAP BAPI’s, Mi-
crosoft Biztalk, UDDI, ebXML, standard modeling lan-
guages (UML), and lastly, model interchange formats
(XMI).
This minitrack presents seven excellent papers that ad-
dress and challenge the wide range of research topics and
solutions within the field of enterprise application integra-
tion such as presented in the above.
The first paper by David Flater is entitled “Impact of
Model-Driven Architectures (MDA)”. This paper discusses
the gradual migration of many standardization organiza-
tions, such as the Object Management Group (OMG) into
the area of modeling, transcending rather low-level inter-
face standards such as IDL. In particular, this paper focuses
at the OMG’s MDA and explains how it can be used to im-
plement various levels of interoperability.
The second paper, by Ernst Kesseler presents practical
experiences with integrating existing real-time simulators
for training, mission planning and networked organizations,
consolidated in the SmartFED tool.
The paper of Marinos Themistocleous and Zahir Tari
outlines a case study of a multinational petroleum company
that adopted an enterprise application integration strategy
to integrate its ERP systems. This case study resulted in
some interesting observations, e.g., 60% of the time to in-
tegrate systems is consumed for reengineering the business
processes.
The next paper, written by Jeff Sutherland and Willem-
Jan van den Heuvel, combines theories from the area of
Complex Adaptive Systems (CASs) to explain the adaptive
behavior of biological systems, with research from the arena
of enterprise application integration that is based on apply-
ing integration that is based on a variety of business object
technologies (middleware, frameworks and components).
Lastly, Jilles van Gurp, Rein Smedinga and Jan Bosch
introduce an architectural design notation, that allows com-
position of architectural components and superimposition
of the components on each other. In this way, the authors
argue, the resulting information systems are capable of deal-
ing with change in a graceful manner.
