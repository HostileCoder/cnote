Abstract 
Recent research on modeling timing jitter has raised a requirement for a predictable, high magnitude, uniform, 
and wide bandwidth H-field. In this paper, a novel H-field generator design methodology is proposed. It consists of 
a single layer air core solenoid and a digital power switch driver that takes advantage of low power, wide bandwidth, 
and big current-driven capability. With input overdrive voltage, the digital switch can drive rail-to-rail voltage with 
output current up to 16A and power bandwidth more than 3 MHz. 
This paper demonstrates a novel solenoid driver circuit to generate an accurate H-field by comparing digital and 
analog approaches and comparing the experimental data with the theoretical data. 
1. Introduction 
Current advanced technology has integrated test functions of automatic test equipment (ATE) into the testhead 
board so that the volume, cooling requirement, and power consumption of ATE are reduced dramatically while 
functionality is increased greatly. As a result, very powerful DC-DC converters are used very often on the test head 
board for ATE. 
[1] has presented analysis and measurement of timing jitter induced by radiated EMI from the switch operation 
of DC-DC converters. To model the radiated EMI onto the timing jitter, an external H-field is applied around the 
phase-locked loop on the board. [ 1] used a ferrite core solenoid and a LC resonant circuit driven by a function 
generator. However, the H-field it generates is not large enough compared with the real magnitude of the H-field 
induced by the on-board and adjacent-board DC-DC noise. It also shows saturation problem due to the magnetic 
material saturation [5]. Its high inductance makes it vulnerable to the environment noise such as a PC board with 
ground plane [4], and the inductance changes with the H-field. All these will induce impedance error that may be 
dominant in the resonance circuit. Therefore, the current driving the solenoid and the generated H-field are not 
predictable. 
In this paper, a single layer air core solenoid and a digital switch solenoid driver are proposed for the novel 
H-field generator. In contrast to analog drivers, there is no bias current for the digital switch. Theoretically, it 
can drive up to 16A current with more than 3 MHz power bandwidth. 
2. Solenoid as an Electromagnetic Device 
2.1. Inductance of a Solenoid 
The inductance of a solenoid shown in Fig. 1 can be calculated by [9J 
L J1N2A 
I 
, where 
J10 - Permeability of the free space 
k - Relative permeability of the magnetic material to the free space 
N - Number of turns 
N' - Turns per meter 
(1) 
For a solenoid to generate a strong H-field, large inductance is not desirable. In such case, small input frequency 
fluctuation will vary very much its impedance, which may make conducting current unpredictable. For example, 
for a 4-layer, lOa-turn, ferrite core solenoid, the inductance L is about 285 J1H for a certain size and wire. If the 
real frequency is w, then the impedance error induced by the input frequency fluctuation for a LC resonant circuit 
is: 
Z ILW - dw i 
I
w2 -w5 1 
Cww5 (2) 
, where Wo = l/VLC is the resonant frequency. When Wo is 27r X 500 kHz, the resonant capacitance C is 355 
pF. If w is 27r x 502 kHz, Z will approximately be 7.2 f!. It can be even larger when the resonant frequency 
changes. Therefore, the impedance error can not be ignored. However, if inductance is reduced, C has to be 
bigger. Therefore, from Eq. (2), we can see the impedance error can be reduced by using a larger resonant 
capacitor, i.e. a lower inductance of the solenoid.

] -2- (4R2 + 4D2 + [2 - 4Dl)! + (4R2 + 4D2 + [2 + 4Dl)! 
, where I is the current through the coil. 
(3) 
If there is a magnetic material in the core of the coil, {Lo has to be changed to {L [9] [3], which is permeability 
of the magnetic material and equal to k{Lo. Therefore, the magnetic field strength H at the point P, which is in 
the air, can be calculated by H = B / {Lo. If D is replaced with S + l/2, then H becomes 
H _ k IN' [ -S S + l 
] - 2 (R2 + S2)!

(6) 
From Eq. (4), (5) and (6), it can be seen that increasing k, I, N', l, and decreasing Rand S can increase H at 
the point P. 
k can be increased by choosing different magnetic materials. For example, for a ferrite core, k can be 8 and 
1000000 for a Ferrite U60 and a supermalloy, respectively. Very big k can dramatically increase the magnetic field 
of the coil, but make it very easy to saturate and very unstable to the variations of temperature and voltage etc. 
N' can be increased by using multiple layers. Rand S are determined by the application, which typically requires 
S as small as possible and R to satisfy the area requirement for H-field coverage. Increasing k, N', l, however, can 
increase inductance as well. As shown in Eq. (4), inductance does not help increase H-field but make it vulnerable 
to the input frequency error and environment noise. Therefore, inductance of the solenoid should be as small as 
possible. 
Alternatively, an air core and single layer solenoid is proposed and very high current I is used to drive the coil. 
l and I are carefully chosen so that a reasonable high H-field is generated. It has an inductance of only several 
{LHs, such that very high noise immunity is accomplished. Compared with a multiple-layer solenoid, a single layer 
solenoid has the advantage of low self-capacitance and thus high self-resonant frequency [8]. In conclusion, an air 
core and single layer solenoid becomes the choice of design. 
3. Solenoid Driver 
3.1. Analog Drivers 
In order to see the efficiency of analog drivers, a source follower using an N-channel power FET transistor was 
designed as shown in Fig. 2. But it has problems of stability and low current driving capability due to its big bias 
current. Then a power operational amplifier circuit shown in Fig. 3 was tested. However, the power bandwidth is 
limited. In our application, although it works up to 60 kHz, it is still not big enough for the research of radiated 
EMI noise from DC-DC converters on timing jitter. Although there exist commercial operational power amplifiers 
working more than 1 MHz frequency power bandwidth, they are not cost effective. 
3.2. Digital Switch Driver 
A digital power switch using both N and P-channel power FET transistors is proposed as an alternative. 
The proposed digital driver circuit is shown in Fig. 4. Instead of using an analog sine wave, which will have 
dead zone for the digital switch driver, as in the cases for analog drivers, a square wave is used as the input 
signal overdriving to the supply voltage. The transistors have very low channel resistance and very high switch

speed [7] [6]. Theoretically, it can drive up to 16A current and more than 3 MHz frequency. It satisfies both 
frequency and current driving capability requirements. It has several advantages: 
1. Rail-to-rail output voltage. 
2. Low power consumption because of no static current from Vdd to Vss. 
3. High stability due to the digital operation. 
4. Higher noise immunity. 
5. Much less cost than a linear power operational amplifier. 
The circuit uses multiple carbon resistors to reduce the parasitic inductance. If one wire resistor is used, even 
though it shows high power rating, it suffers from the parasitic inductance from the wire resistor. A small sense 
resister R3 is used, as shown in Fig. 4, to measure the voltage so that current through the coil can be calculated 
by just dividing the value of the sense resistance. Fig. 5, 6, 7, and 8 show the voltage waveforms of the sense 
resister under different frequencies.

4. Measured H-field and Calculated H-field 
4.1. Measured H-field 
A Hewlett-Packard close-field probe 11941A is used to measure the generated H-field. If the resonant circuit is 
used, the capacitance has to be tuned whenever the frequency is changed. In order to simplify the measurement 
process, the resonant capacitor was not used. Even though there is impedance due to inductance, it is predictable. 
As shown in Fig. 9, the H-field is not flat, otherwise the curves in Fig. 9 will be almost flat. The final measured 
H is calculated by 
H = VSA +AF+K (7) 
, where 
VSA - Voltage in dBp,V measured on spectrum analyzer 
AF - HP 11941A Antenna Factor in dB (J-t�(m) 
K - Loss or gain in dB between HP 11941A and spectrum analyzer. 
Figure 5. Voltage Waveform of the Sensor Resister for 100 kHz Input Frequency 
Figure 6. Voltage Waveform of the Sensor Resister for 400 kHz Input Frequency 
In our case, there is no extra gain or loss, so K is zero. Also for frequency lower than 1 MHz, we assume the 
Antenna Factor is linearly distributed. The measured H-field is shown in Table 1.

5. Comparison of Measured H-field and Calculated H-field 
As in Fig. 4, since we didn't use the resonant capacitor, the current can be calculated by 
(8) 
, where R2 is the current limiting resistor. 
From Fig. 9, we can see the error between calculated and measured H-field is quite small. If a resonant capacitor 
is used to cancel the impedance of the solenoid, R2 becomes 0 n, and R3 is reduced to 0.375 n, the maximum 
16A current can be reached. Therefore, the constant and highest H-field, theoretically more than 190 dBf.1'v/m, 
can be achieved. Comparing this current-driving solenoid driver with the voltage-driving driver using a function 
generator in [1] which cannot output more than 1A current, the advantage of using this novel digital current 
driver is quite obvious.

6. Conclusion 
In this paper, an analysis on inductance, H-field, and choosing a solenoid as the source of the H-field generator 
is given. A digital solenoid driver is proposed and tested. Compared with analog drivers, the digital driver has 
advantage of low power, stable, and powerful current-driven capability. The novel H-field generator is used for 
further research on modeling timing jitter.
