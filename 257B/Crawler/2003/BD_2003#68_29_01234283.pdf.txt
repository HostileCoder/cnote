There is an increasing interest in OC-768 systems that transmit
data at speeds of 40-43 Gb/s due to its ability to reduce the cost-
per-bit of transmitted data. In the transmit direction of a Serdes-
Framer-Interface Level 5 (SFI-5) compliant OC-768 system, six-
teen channels of NRZ 2.5Gb/s current-mode logic (CML) electri-
cal data are multiplexed into a signal at 40-43Gb/s. A 17th chan-
nel is used to deskew data on the 16 channels[1]. To reduce the
cross talk, this transmitter is partitioned into two devices: 1) an
SFI-5 compliant 16:4 multiplexer (MUX) that recovers the input
data, aligns the 16 channels according to the information in the
17th channel and multiplexes the 16 x 2.5Gb/s data into 4
streams of 10Gb/s data; and 2) a 4:1 MUX/CMU (reported in
paper 13.4). This paper focuses on the 16:4 MUX implemented in
a 0.18¬µm 120GHz fT SiGe BiCMOS process [2].
The block diagram of the 16:4 chip is shown in Fig. 13.5.1. It
comprises 17 input lanes, a digital deskew logic block, and a
128:4 MUX. Each input lane comprises an input buffer, a delay-
locked-loop (DLL) and a 1:8 demultiplexer (DEMUX). Since the
differential peak-to-peak amplitude of the 2.5Gb/s data inputs
can vary from 0.175V to 1V[4], input buffers are used to ampli-
fy/limit the input data to the emitter-coupled logic (ECL) level
and also provide the required 1.2V termination. 
The SFI-5 compliant 2.5Gb/s data, corrupted by low-frequency
wander and high-frequency jitter, are recovered by the DLL
which also adjusts the rising edge of the 2.5GHz clock to the data
eye center. Conventional voltage-controlled delay line (VCDL)
DLLs have finite delays, and therefore, suffer from limited lock
range. Noise transients or leakage in the duration of long
sequences of 1s or 0s data can lead to a condition in which the
loop has exhausted its locking range. The dual loop architecture
in Figure 13.5.2 is adopted to overcome this limitation. The cali-
bration loop is a conventional VCDL which ensures its line delay
is half of the 2.5GHz clock period across process, temperature
and supply voltage variation. The eight identical delay cells with
differential topology generate eight clock phases spanning 0O to
157.5O through positive taps, and the other eight phases span-
ning 180O to 337.5O through the complement taps. This comple-
mentary architecture reduces the power of the delay line by a
factor of 2. A bang-bang rather than a linear-phase detector is
chosen in order to reduce the phase offset caused by the leakage
current from the charge pump; the penalty paid is a slightly
increased bang-bang jitter of 2 ps peak to peak. Sharing a cali-
bration loop between every two adjacent DLLs reduces the cali-
bration- loop power dissipation by a factor of 2. 
The main loop is a digital loop. After comparing the phase rela-
tionship between the input data and the clock, the main loop
adjusts the choice of the clock phase so that the clock rising edge
is at the center of the data eye. In this architecture, because a
finite-state machine (FSM) controls the selection of the phase,
the output clock phase can be easily rotated to provide unlimit-
ed (modulo 2œÄ) phase shift capability, as in a phase-locked loop
(PLL). However, this dual loop DLL excludes the problems of sta-
bility and phase-error accumulation commonly associated with a
conventional VCO-based PLL[3]. Another advantage of this dig-
ital DLL architecture is that long sequences of continuous 1s or
0s at the input will not cause phase drift as in an analog loop due
to charge pump leakage.
Figure 13.5.3 shows the block diagram of the deskew block. The
2.488Gb/s input data lanes in the SFI-5 compliant device can
have skew with respect to each other as well as relative and
absolute wander. The function of this block is to deskew the 16
data lanes using the deskew channel (DSC) [1] and absorb any
wander before they are combined into four 10Gb/s lanes. The cir-
cuit can compensate for 11b of static skew and 21b of dynamic
wander/jitter. The deskew circuit receives 17 lanes (16 data plus
DSC) of 2.5Gb/s data on 312.5Mb/s byte-wide paths as provided
by the 1:8 DEMUX block. Each lane's data has arbitrary bit
alignment within a byte. The bit-aligner subcircuit aligns the
data at byte boundaries. The data then enters the First-in/First-
out (FIFO), which serves two purposes: the FIFO transfers all 17
data lanes which have individual clocks to a common clock
domain derived from the 5GHz clock as well as absorb any wan-
der in the data lanes with respect to each other or the common
transmit clock. The deskew logic then uses the byte delays to line
up the data and passes them to the 128:4 MUX block. 
Figure 13.5.4 shows the block diagram of the 128:4 MUX which
consists of 4 parallel 32:1 MUX blocks and a clock divider which
generates 2.5, 1.25GHz and 622.5-MHz clocks from the off-chip
5GHz clock. Each of the 32:1 MUXs is comprised of a bank of 2:1
MUXs in a tree-type structure, and the 2:1 MUX is based on a 5-
latch structure. The 128 x 312.5Mb/s single-ended full-rail
CMOS data from the deskew logic are multiplexed into 4
streams of data at 10Gb/s. CMOS to ECL converters (C2E) are
placed at the 32:8 CMOS MUX outputs, where the data rate is
1.25Gb/s. 
The 16:4 MUX was co-packaged with the 4:1 MUX in a custom
package and achieved an error-free operation with 231-1 PRBS
input data for over 12 hours, at which point the measurement
was terminated. The 622.5MHz output clock sent to the framer
achieves an rms jitter of 2.15ps. Figure 13.5.5 presents the mea-
sured jitter tolerance at 2.488Gb/s, which meets the SxI-5 speci-
fication[4]. The input sensitivity is measured as better than
100mV differential peak-to-peak, and the chip achieves error-
free operation with the speed of the input data varying from 36
Gb/s to 43 Gb/s. The last two results are limited by measurement
equipments. Figure 13.5.6 summarizes the measurement results
and Fig. 13.5.7 shows the chip micrograph.
