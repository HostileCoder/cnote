Abstract: It is increasingly being recognized that 
navigation and communications systems play an ever- 
expanding role in the proliferation and application of 
autonomous underwater vehicles (AWs)..The objective 
ofthis study was to quantify the impact ofhighaccuracy 
navigation requirements on the performance ofthese 
systems withm an MCM scenario. 
The assessment quantified the UUV navigation 
requirements based on the time to complete a mission 
(i.e., search an area to a specific probability of detection/ 
classification (PdPc)). The assessment also examined 
thecommunicationcapabilityrequiredintermsofde~g 
a required data message (size, content, transmission/ 
storage time, etc). We investigated four different 
navigation conceptdtactics used to search a 1000 by 
8000 yards region that varies in depth from 10 to 40 
feet. A lawnmower search with a uniform track spacing 
of 30 yards was used for each case. The results showed 
that tactics were a big driver and in some cases, having a 
high accuracy INS unit on a U W  can be detrimental to 
overall mission performance. This assessment was 
conducted using the Autonomous Littoral Warfare 
Systems Evaluator - Monte. Carlo (ALWSE-MC) 
simulation developed by the Coastal Systems Station 
(CSS).
