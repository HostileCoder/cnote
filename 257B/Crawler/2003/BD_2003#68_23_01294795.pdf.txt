Abstract- This work reveals that the number and strength of 
Canary Island mesoscale eddies is higher during the second 
semester of 1998 year and it is dominated by long lived (>6 
months) and big size (>150 km) anticyclonic eddies, propagating 
westward hundreds of kilometers (>500 km) from the place they 
were generated. This prevalence of anticyclones could be 
motivated by the mutual influence of mesoscale eddies. This 
interaction is documented showing the coalescence during 
October 1998 of various anticyclonic eddies of different sizes, 
strengths and stages of development. 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
As mentioned by [1], respect to other eastern boundary 
currents, the Canary Current upwelling region has a distinctive 
topographic feature. It is the Canarian Archipelago, consisting 
of seven main islands distributed zonally at 28ºN between 100 
km and 600 km from the African coastline (Fig. 1). Then, the 
archipelago span the transition zone between the upwelled 
eutrophic coastal waters and the offshore oligotrophic waters, 
and it produces a disturbing effect over the equatoward flow of 
the Canary Current and the Trade winds. This generates 
mesoscale variability downstream of the islands in the form of 
warm wakes and cyclonic and anticyclonic eddies. So far the 
most documented and studied features are those found south of 
Gran Canaria Island, using both in-situ and remote sensing 
observations [2], [3]. 
 From these previous works, it has been concluded that island 
induced eddies are recurrent oceanographic structures which in 
combination with others coming from the coastal zone, like 
upwelling filaments, contribute significantly to the variability 
of the observed physical and biological fields south of the 
islands, as shown in [2]. In spite of the advances made a 
number of questions relative to the formation and evolution of 
island induced eddies, remains unanswered because of the 
spatial and temporal coverage limitations of preceding 
observations. 
Recently, it has been also shown that south of Canary Islands 
anticyclonic eddies are usually bigger than cyclonic ones and 
they have been observed during some months. Then, this paper 
is focused on the study of island generated anticyclonic eddies, 
using a data set covering the needed spatial and temporal 
requirements. It was decided to carry out a joint analysis of all 
available AVHRR satellite scenes and ERS-2 altimeter data 
covering the Canary Island upwelling region for a period 
higher than a year for the present research. 
II.  DATA PROCESSING AND METHODS
AVHRR images corresponding to 1998 year and first 
months of 1999 were provided four times a day at the 
Universidad de Las Palmas de Gran Canaria high resolution 
picture transmission (HRPT) receiving station, belonging to the 
Servicio de Ecologia Asistido por Satélite (SeaS-Canarias). 
The raw HRPT data were processed to channel 4 (brightness 
temperature) and sea surface temperature (SST) scenes and 
then they were geometrically corrected. After that, a dynamic 
scene analysis was realized with monthly movies generated 
using all the good satellite image frames. Then useful 
oceanographic information not accessible in isolated images 
was extracted as the evolution of size and position of 
mesoscale features. 
ERS-2 sea level anomalies (SLA) data from January 1998 to 
March 1999 were processed for this work following the 
methodology described in [4]. Data were generated by the 
Collecte Localization Satellites (CLS), and taken from CD-
ROM by Archiving, Validation and Interpretation of Satellite

tracks are shown in Fig. 1. The SLA data were gridded onto 
15 day, 0.5

 Island eddies were labelled to distinguish each other. It was 
done taking in account their cyclonic or anticyclonic character 
(indicated with letter C or A), and the place where they were 
generated. A number was added at the end to differentiate 
eddies shedded at different times from the same location. 
III.  RESULTS
A. Trajectories, drift speed and size of long live eddies 
 Only a few eddies identified by visual inspection in 
AVHRR scenes, were observed as prominent features during 
an extended time higher than two months during 1998. The 
first long live anticyclonic, AC1, was detected south of Gran 
Canaria on June 26, 1998. This eddy followed the path 
showed in Fig. 2a as observed in satellite data. It was initially 
advected to the south at a mean speed about ∼3.5 cm s
-1
.
Then, starting August it moved ∼35 km eastward maintaining 
its speed, motivated perhaps by the presence of anticyclonic 
eddy, AT1, placed further offshore, and after that, it continued 
shifting slowly to the south at ∼1.75 cm s
-1
 reaching the 
nearest position to the continental shelf at ∼26ºN on 
September 10. Taking in account that Canary Island eddies 
usually extend to several hundred meters depth [1], it is quite 
possible that bottom topography could operate slowing down 
or arresting AC1. In September AC1 started to move westward 
again at a mean speed of ∼3 cm s
-1
 coinciding with the 
displacement of AT1 further offshore, increasing AC1 further 
its size to ∼160 km being detected until the end of October, 
when it apparently collided with other anticyclonic island eddy, 
AT2, as it will be described in next section. Eddy AC1 had the 
spatial scale and the strength necessary to be recorded by 
altimeter data. It is confirmed in sea level anomaly maps 
corresponding to the cycles 34 to 36 where relatively high 
values (>15 cm) of sea level are found south of Gran Canaria 
(Fig. 3a). 
 The individual island eddy that could be identified the 
longest time in satellite data during 1998 was an anticyclone 
detected south of Tenerife on July 27, referred as AT1. The 
path followed by this eddy is shown in Fig. 2b.This eddy 
reached a diameter size of ∼150 km in only one month and 
travelled southwestward but showing a predominant western 
component, moving at a mean speed about ∼4.6 cm s
-1
 (111 
day average) and holding up this direction until half November 
when the eddy center reached a latitude and longitude next to 
25.8ºN and 21ºW. During this time AT1 kept its size of ∼150 
km and could be tracked easily through sea level anomaly 
maps (Fig. 3a). Afterwards, the eddy continued progressing 
westward meandering (Fig. 3b). In total, during the six months 
that AT1 was followed, it crossed a considerable distance of 
about ∼650 km, meaning that in average this eddy moved 
around 100 km by month. 
These results suggest an apparent disproportionate 
dominance of anticyclones for the Canary Islands region. This 
agrees with theoretical and observational results in other 
eastern boundary regions as shown by [5] supporting the 
anticyclones dominance. Ref. [6] explained the propensity of 
these features due to the fission of cyclones and the merge of 
anticyclones. Evidences of merging of anticyclonic eddies 
shedded from the Canary Islands are discussed in next section. 
B. The coalescence of island anticyclonic eddies 
It is known from laboratory observations, analytical and 
numerical models that vortices of the same sign merge if they 
are close enough. This merging is thought to be a frequent 
phenomenon in the ocean, even if there is not documented to 
many examples of these encounters. 
 South of Canary Islands it is often observed the presence 
at the same time of equal signed eddies. Two collisions of 
anticyclonic eddies seem to happen in October 1998. The first 
one was produced by two young vortices generated south of 
Gran Canaria and Tenerife respectively, AC2 and AT2, 
observed first time on October 13. These two eddies became 
elliptical rapidly and they came closer each other forming a 
“figure 8” structure on October 18 (Fig. 4). The mean 
diameters of AC2 and AT2 just before merger took place were 
about 70 and 75 km, and the distance between the centers was 
about 90 km. In the next clear AVHRR scene, available on 
October 23, the size of AT2 had expanded to ∼90 km while 
AC2 had nearly disappeared. This situation resembles to the 
interaction between two unequal vortices in which the weaker 
vortex is wrapped around the outside of the stronger core. 
Therefore, it could be an indication that AT2 was stronger that 
AC2. 
 The second collision was caused by the interaction of eddy 
AT2 (after its first collision) and mature eddy AC1. On 
October 23, eddy AC1 with a mean size about 135 km was

place
d south of AT2, coming closer gradually, adopting both again a 
“figure 8” structure with the centers of eddies separated 130 
km on October 26. There are not clear AVHRR images until 
November 8, in which a bigger anticyclonic eddy with a 
diameter about 160 km was observed, and it is thought as the 
result of the coalescence between eddies AT2 and AC1, and 
then it is referred as AC1T2. This vortex is also recorded in sea 
level anomaly maps as a large core of positive values higher 
than 20 cm in the central part (Fig. 3b). 
 Once the coalescence process finished, AC1T2 started to 
move southwestward, in a similar way to eddy AT1 (Fig. 2a), 
at a mean speed about ∼4.6 cm s
-1
 (35 days average), and then 
in the middle of December when the eddy reached a latitude 
next to 26ºN, it advanced westward at a mean speed about ∼3.5 
cm s
-1
 (68 days average) until February 21, 1999 when the 
eddy was tracked last time. 
IV.  CONCLUSSIONS 
From the observations presented here, the main conclusions 
from this study are as follow: 
1.- Over extended periods the mesoscale dynamics seems to 
be dominated by anticyclones. They show a bigger size (∼150 
km) and are observed during a longer time (more than six 
months) than cyclones. 
2.- A common characteristic of the path of eddies is the 
westward movement of vortices. Then it is possible to find 
long lived anticyclonic eddies more than 500 km westward 
from the island where they were generated at approximately 
26ºN starting the 1999 year. 
3.- Drastic structural changes could be observed when 
anticyclonic eddies became quite close, giving place to a new 
eddy resultant of the coalescence of them. The results suggest 
that this kind of interactions occur commonly south of Canary 
Islands.
