Many scientific applications require that image data be stored in floating point format 
due to the large dynamic range of the data. These applications pose a problem if 
the data needs to be compressed since modern image compression standards, such as 
JPEG2000 are only defined to operate on integer data. The typical way to handle 
floating point data is to do an initial quantization. This approach allows standard 
techniques to be used on the quantized data but may be unacceptable to researchers 
due to the irreversible data loss. Another compression approach is to use strictly 
lossless methods such as LZW based techniques. The disadvantage of this approach 
is low compression ratios, no capability for lossy compression, and low flexibility of 
the compressed data stream. The purpose of this paper is to propose extensions to 
the new JPEG2000 standard which allow for the efficient coding of floating point 
data. These extensions have the advantage that they maintain desirable properties of 
JPEG2000, including flexible embedded bit streams, lossy and lossless compression 
from the same algorithm flow, post-compression rate-distortion optimization , and 
image scalability, while also being efficient. 
Achieving a floating point image compression algorithm that is compatible with 
JPEG2000 is a difficult task, especially when considering the problems of reversible 
floating point color and wavelet transforms. Consequently, this paper only considers 
the more narrow problem of deriving floating point bit plane coding algorithms for 
JPEG2000. The importance of the results here are that bit plane coding is needed for 
an overall floating point algorithm, and thus can be applied when acceptable wavelet 
and color transforms are derived. In addition, a complete floating point algorithm 
can be attained by applying bit plane coding directly to the untransformed image 
coefficients (as in done in bi-Ievel image coding, and intrinsically done on the low-low 
wavelet transformed subband) . 
The proposed approach for bit plane coding is to represent floating point values as 
"big integers" and code these integers directly as in JPEG2000. The main advantage 
of this approach is that all properties of JPEG2000 are retained, whereas the main 
disadvantage is loss of efficiency. For example, coding 32 bit float values potentially 
requires coding 278 bit planes. Efficiency can be improved by noting that each coef­
ficient is coded in only 24 bit planes, which is a small fraction of the total number. 
The paper introduces a separate eligibility pass every several bit planes to lower the 
number of coefficients coded in each coding pass resulting in improved efficiency. In 
addition, the paper expands the concept of significance and context formation to 
accommodate bit plane coding of floating point values.
