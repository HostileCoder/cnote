Abstract- The middle Yangtze plain, located on the central of 
China, is well-known to the world as one of the regions mostly 
suffering from flooding disaster in China in recently. The 
increasing flooding is not only the results of the nature process, 
but also the results of the land use/cover change. The research on 
the land use/cover change is very helpful to trace the flooding 
damage. In this paper, a series of land use/cover coverage were 
first generated through visually interpreting LandsatTM and 
ETM image data of 1990, 1995 and 2000 with MGE and 
ARC/INFO software. Then, based on the net-change analysis, 
conversion matrix and dynamic degree model, the characteristics 
of spatial-temporal change and the transfer of land use/cover 
were analyzed in this area. The results showed that the areas of 
farmland and woodland decreased, while that of built-up area, 
water area, grassland and non-used land increased during the 
past 10 years, and there was a significant shifting from farmland 
to water body or built-up area. From 1990 to 2000, the cultivated 
land decreased by 78600 hm2, of which 55% was changed to 
water area, especially most to fishpond, and 33.41% to the 
built-up land. For the same 5-year interval, the pace of land-use 
change in 1990-1995 was much faster than in 1995-2000. By 
using the dynamic degree model, it was found that the greatest 
changes of land use/cover occurred in big city, i.e., Wuhan City，
Nanchang City, and the slowest change mainly in the counties 
near the Dongting Lake and the Poyang Lake. Because the 
large-scale land reclamation from lake ever in history has been 
curbed effectively in this flooding plain since 1990, the authors 
deduced that the worsened flooding risk in this area should be 
attributed to the over-reclamation before 1990. Since 1990, 
although there has been the return of the cultivated land to lake, 
it has not sufficiently alleviated the flooding disaster duo to a 
limited restore of water body. 
Ⅰ．INTRODUCTION 
Changes of land use and land cover (LUCC) are of the most 
importance among human alteration of the Earth’s land 
surface [1]. The research on the changes is not only one of 
core projection in the Global change study, but also one of the 
hot spots in the resources management and environmental 
sciences.  
The middle Yangtze plain of central China is one of 
important bases for grain product as well as one of the 
well-known regions seriously suffering from flooding disaster 
in the whole country [2]. Because land use/cover change is 
one of key factors resulting in the increasingly flooding 
disaster in the low-lying flooding plain, it is important to 
identify the dynamic process of the change.  
For a long time, the change of land use/cover in the area is 
seldom explored systematically due to the lack of adequate 
and acute serial data on land use. So, this study is aimed at 
presenting the spatial-temporal patterns of the change via two 
phases: (1) Generating a series of land-use coverage were 
gotten firstly through visually interpreting Landsat TM and 
ETM image data; and (2) Analyzing the spatial-temporal 
characteristics of land use/cover changes at different period 
during the last decade. 
Ⅱ.STUDY AREA 
The middle Yangtze River plain of central China covers an 
area of 138345km2, of which 30234km2 in Hunan province, 
70490km2 in Hubei province and 37620 km2 in Jiangxi 
province (Fig.1). In this area, there are top-ranking fresh lakes 
in China, including Poyang Lake which is the largest lake, 
Dongting Lake which is the next, and the well-known 
Jianghan Lakes. 
The area has a subtropical monsoon climate, with an 
average annual rainfall range of 1000–1600 mm, and annual 
mean temperature of approximately15-17℃. Because of the 
long-term silt deposition and over-done reclamation, the 
Dongting Lake shrank rapidly from 4350 km2 in the 1940s to 
0-7803-8742-2/04/$20.00 (c) 2004 IEEE 2654
less than 2691 km2 in 1979, and the Poyang Lake from 5200 
km2 to 3800 km2, and the Jianghan Lakes from 8330 km2 to 
2370 km2. Accompanying with the sharp shrinkage of these 
lakes, the flooding and waterlogging is becoming more and 
more serious. For instance, the economic loss caused by the 
disasters in the Dongting Lake area remarkably increased 
from 16 billion yuans in 1950-1959 to 109 billion yuans in 
1990-1998. Obviously, the land use was one of the key factors 
that have resulted in the increasing flooding damages. How 
about the recent change of land use/cover in this area recently? 
This is the project need to study further.

 III. Data and methods 
A. Data Sources 
   The basic spatial data of land use/cover of 2000 in this 
paper came from the national resource and environment 
database, and moreover, the Landsat TM and ETM data, 
which were captured in 1990,1995 and 2000 respectively, 
were used for extracting the information of the land use 
change while topographic map, regional thematic research 
data and maps were consulted Besides, statistic data on social 
and economics used in this paper were gathered from statistic 
yearbook, and household survey.  
 
B. Methods   
The information of land use/cover change can be extracted 
from satellite data by means of image-to-image comparison, 
image-to-map comparison and map-to-map comparison. In 
this process, the automated image classifier generally work 
well in spectrally homogeneous areas, but not in highly 
heterogeneous regions even though many techniques have 
been developed for improving automated classification [3]. 
The remote sensing characteristics of different land use/cover 
types vary according to not only the spectral reflectance but 
also the shape, size, position, etc., and it is impossible for any 
particular automated image classifier to be applicable to 
mapping all of them [4]. In reality, supported by GIS, manual 
interpretation of satellite image has been applied with 
satisfactory accuracies to the detection of the spatial-temporal 
dynamic of land use/cover change processes [5] [6] [7] [4]. 
In this paper, a method of visually interpreting image on 
screen, based on the image-to-map comparison, was adopted. 
The first step was to make the land use map from the Landsat 
TM/ETM image of 2000[8], and build up the database with 
the ARC/INFO software. A two-level classification system 
was applied. There are six catalogs in the first-level, i.e., 
cultivated land, woodland, grassland, water area, built-up area 
and non-used land. In the second-level of the classification, 
there are 19 types. As example, the cultivated land is split into 
paddy field and dry land. The second is to overlay the land 
use map of 2000 on the 1990 and 1995 image data 
respectively, and extract the changing information of the land 
use/cover after registering the different images geometrically. 
By means of image-to-map comparison, the changing 
boundaries of the land use/cover types can be detected.  
Ⅳ.RESULTS 
A.  The temporal Patterns of Land use/cover Changes 
The research results indicated that the areas of farmland, 
woodland and grassland decreased, while of others, water area, 
grassland, built-up area and unused area, increased from 1990 
to 2000.  
As shown in table 1, the farmland land decreased by 78580 
hm2 in 1990-2000, taking account for 1.04% of the total 
cultivated land. For the 5-year interval, a decrease was 
continuously observed though the pace declined. It reduced 
by 65426 hm2 in 1990-1995 while only 13154 hm2 in 
1995-2000, and the percent of farmland area decreased in 
total area changed from 0.87% to 0.18% correspondingly. A 
little decrease of 3051 hm2 and 210 hm2 were detected for 
woodland and grassland respectively during the last ten years. 
Among the land use categories that areas increased, the area 
of built-up area increased significantly by up to 41382 hm2, 
with an expansion rate of 7.28% of the total built-up area 
during the decade. At the different period, it was found that 
0-7803-8742-2/04/$20.00 (c) 2004 IEEE 2655
the increasing area in the previous 5 years was 28058 
hm2more than that in the late 5 years. Another land-use type 
whose area increased remarkably was water area, with an 
increase of 34012 hm2, about 1.90% of the water body area 
during the 10 years. An outspread of 39614hm2 was observed 
in the first period, and small shrinkage of the water area was 
detected in the second period in reverse. The grassland area 
decreased by 1162 hm2 in the previous 5 years, however, 
increased by 952 hm2 in the late 5 years. Unused land, 
including beaches and swamp, changed greatly due of the 
seasonally fluctuated of water level. It increased about 1996 
hm2 in 1990-1995, while by 8444 hm2 in 1995-2000. This can 
be an implication that the flooding stresses in the district seem 
to become more serious.

B.  The Conversion of Land use/cover Changes 
What did the land use and land cover in the study area 
change from and to during the recent decades? These issues 
can be addressed by the analysis on the conversion of land 
use/cover change.

area 360  99  0  3422  20 -- Unused
land % 9.2  2.5  0.0  87.7  0.5 -- 
 
There is a significant shift from farmland to water body and 
built-up area. As shown in table 2, about 62%(65687 hm2) 
and 31%(33112 hm2) of the farmland area decreased were 
changed into water body and built-up area respectively during 
the period of 1990-2000,and at the same time there were 
about 22152hm2 area shifted from water body to cultivated 
land, and 4240 hm2 from woodland. Because the farmland 
area changing to water area was far more than that changing 
from water area, the large-scale reclamation from lake ever in 
history has been curbed effectively in the studied area. 
The expansion of every kind of built-up land was 
remarkably at the expense of farmland. 80.01% of the 
increased area came from cultivated land between 1990 and 
2000, and the loss of forest took account for the most of the 
remains. None of built-up land was observed changing to 
other land use classes. 
The spread of the water area was come mainly from 
farmland, unused land and grassland, hardly from forest. Most 
of the woodland area decreased was lost to built-up land, and 
the unused land area mainly to water area at two periods. 
C.  The Spatial Differentiation of Land use/cover Changes 
In order to reveal the regional differentiation of land 
use/cover change, the dynamic degree model was used. The 
model is defined as follows (Liu et al., 2000): 
        n 
s = ｛∑(△si-j/si)｝*(1/t)*100%     （i,j = 1,2,…n）          
        ij 
where si is the total area of the land use type ‘i’ at the 
beginning of monitoring, △si-j is the overall area of land use 
type ‘i’ changed to ‘j’ type from the begin to the end of the 
monitoring period, t is the period of the years from beginning 
to the end of monitoring, and s is the land use change rate 
among the period ‘t’, which is the land use change dynamic 
degree. 
Taking the administrative unit as basic mapping unit, the 
degree was calculated and mapped out. Fig.2 revealed that, 
from 1990 to 2000, the city, such as Wuhan City, Xiantao 
City, Nanchang City, Ezhou, Huangshi, and Hanchuan, had 
high dynamic degree of more than 50, suggesting the faster 
changes of land use/cover in the cities. Counties near to the 
Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake, had got the lower value of 
less than 5, and the changing speed was lower in this region. 
 
Ⅴ.CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION  
The increasing flooding in the middle Yangtze plain is not 
only a natural process, but also the result of inappropriate land

Fig.2 Distribution of the dynamic degree of the land use/cover change in the study area 
 
 use, i.e., the large-scale land reclamation from lake in 
history. Thus, explicitly monitoring the spatial-temporal 
changes of land use/cover is of most importance to trace 
the flooding damage.  
From 1990 to 2000, the areas of farmland, woodland and 
grassland decreased, while that of built-up area, water area 
and non-used land increased, and the changing pace in 
1990-1995 was much faster than in 1995-2000. Land use in 
city-level administrative unit changed rapidly duo to their 
well economic condition and more population. The slowest 
changed area existed in the counties near to east and southeast 
of the lake area. Since 1990, there was a significant shifting 
from farmland to water body or built-up area. Because 
large-scale reclamation from lake ever in history has not been 
observed in the studied area since 1990, it can be concluded 
that the worsened flooding risk in this area should be 
attributed to the over-reclamation before 1990.
