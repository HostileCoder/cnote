Abstract 
This paper describes a qualitative research study that 
surfaced practitioner interpretations (assumptions, 
knowledge, and expectations) of applications integration 
downsides.  Although integration is the primary benefit of 
enterprise systems, like most things, integration also has a 
downside.  However, most people agree that integration is 
still desirable.  The challenge is to understand and 
manage the negative aspects of integration to minimize 
the adverse effects.  Doing this requires an awareness of 
the potential problems.  This paper augments past 
research on this subject with the results from a recent 
investigation of integration of applications for enterprise 
systems.  Fifty-one people representing three stakeholder 
groups from four organizations were interviewed.  The 
data revealed thirty-one unique integration downsides 
representing at least five dimensions.  It now appears that 
integration is not always desirable or practical for a 
number of legitimate reasons.  Collectively, organizations 
spend billions of dollars to achieve integration so it seems 
reasonable that understanding applications integration 
downsides is important to success.  Yet, little is known 
about practitioners’ perceptions of integration that 
influence their decisions and actions.   
1. Introduction 
Integration has been a major objective of MIS for 
decades [1], [2], [3], [4].  Integration of separate and 
isolated “islands” of systems and data began with projects 
involving a few applications [5].  Less than two decades 
ago, the floodgates of applications integration burst open 
with ERP implementations gaining considerable 
momentum in the mid 1990s as Y2K approached.  
Integration objectives encompassed enterprise-wide 
initiatives such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) 
systems and enterprise data warehouses [6].  
Organizations have pursued several different approaches 
to integration including ERP, EAI, Middleware, and 
Componentware.  Today, integration among organizations 
is an increasing trend.  This new breed of integration, 
known as B2B and interorganizational systems (IOSs), 
transcend legal enterprise boundaries [7], [8].   
The research presented in this paper reveals 
practitioner perceptions (assumptions, knowledge, and 
expectations) of applications integration downsides.  
Integrated enterprise systems are defined as artificial 
mechanisms created by organizations to compete in the 
marketplace and to perform routine operations.  
Understanding and studying these monolithic creations 
has been and continues to be difficult.  One approach is to 
investigate practitioner perceptions of enterprise systems 
since people, representing a variety of stakeholder groups 
create, implement, manage, and operate integrated 
systems.  The work on social construction of technology 
[9] and technological frames [10], [11] suggests 
approaches than can be used to study complex IT 
technologies.  This paper adopts the position that 
interpretations of applications integration by practitioners 
are socially constructed and shape organizational 
outcomes.   
The findings of an exploratory study are described 
that surfaced perceptions of downsides to applications 
integration by three stakeholder groups – managers, IT 
professionals and end-users.  Although data was collected 
on different stakeholder groups, analysis of stakeholder 
differences is not the primary purpose of this paper, but 
will be the topic of a future paper.  However, some 
differences in groups are reported in the results.   
The research objective was to investigate attributes 
and benefits of applications integration.  Reality required 
using enterprise systems (ES) as the lens to study this 
phenomenon.  ES are a legitimate implementation of 
applications integration and are the only example of 
applications integration for many practitioners. 
While it is generally assumed that integration is a 
positive thing, the results of this study indicate many 
practitioners believe there are numerous disadvantages 
associated with applications integration even though most 
of these same people still prefer integrated solutions. The 
research reveals legitimate reasons to avoid or limit 
integration although some “downsides” or objections 
appear arbitrary or biased personal preferences.

The remainder of this paper describes the motivation 
for the research and a brief description of the history of IT 
integration.  Then, the relevant literature is reviewed and 
the purpose of this research, its importance, and the need 
for continued research on this topic are discussed.  Next, 
the research methodology, data collection, and data 
analysis procedures are described.  This is followed with a 
description of the results and supporting evidence.  The 
appendix contains a quantitative summary of the results.  
The paper concludes with a discussion of implications and 
future research directions. 
2. Research Motivation 
Although organizations, collectively, spend billions 
of dollars to achieve IT integration, little research has 
been conducted to understand practitioner perceptions of 
problems associated with integration.  The one major 
exception has been studies that investigated ERP success 
factors.  Because practitioner perceptions – including 
assumptions about the characteristics, benefits, and 
downsides of integration – influence decisions and 
actions, this represents a critical knowledge gap.  For 
many practical situations “perception is reality.”  The 
purpose of this research is to begin to address this gap by 
surfacing the shared frames of reference (assumptions, 
knowledge, and expectations) [12] of three stakeholder 
groups - managers, IT professionals and end-users.   
3. The Literature 
The virtues and advantages of applications 
integrations for enterprise systems, especially ERPs, have 
been widely reported in the literature [13], [14], [15], 
[16], [17], [18].  Therefore, the literature reviewed for this 
paper was restricted to framing integration in general and 
the downsides of applications integration in particular.   
3.1. Integration Approaches and Importance of 
IS Research on Integration 
Integration is a widely applied concept in science, 
engineering, computer science, and economics as well as 
IT [19], [20], [21], [22], [13].  A review of the topic of 
integration in the IS research literature shows that the 
pursuit of IT-enabled integration dates back to the dawn 
of the computer age – the idea for enterprise-wide 
integration was considered as early as the 1950s and 
1960s [1].   
During the last five decades, experts have sought to 
integrate the various functions of the enterprise using 
computers [23].  The initial concept was to create a single, 
totally integrated system for an enterprise [24], [25].  The 
next major school of thought that followed sought to 
achieve enterprise integration by having all programs 
“feed” off a single, centralized database for the entire 
organization [23].  Integration efforts has evolved during 
the last half century from interfacing modules of a 
computer program to the electronic coupling of different 
organizations with one another (known as B2B).  
Successive generations of integration technologies have 
become increasingly complex, as the scope of integration 
has continuously expanded.   
Historically, the research emphasis in information 
systems and computer science domains mirrors a similar 
pattern, moving from ‘small scope’ to ‘large scope’ 
integration topics.  The emergence of enterprise systems, 
in particular, has prompted calls for intensive IS research 
in this area.  As Markus and Tanis (1999) comment, 
“Integrated enterprise systems deserve serious research 
because of their great potential for financial, technical, 
managerial, human, and strategic benefits, costs, and 
risks” [14, p. 173].   
3.2. Questioning Integration Objectives 
Increasingly, a few IS researchers have begun to 
question assumptions about the benefits of integration and 
the degree of integration that is desirable or practical [26], 
[27].   
“The value of [an ERP system] is that it is totally 
integrated; and the downside of [an ERP system] 
is that it is totally integrated” [15] cited in [28, p. 
1049].   
While IS researchers are questioning assumptions and 
raising concerns related to applications integration, no 
empirical research has been conducted to understand 
practitioner perspectives on applications integration 
downsides.   
Contrary to popular belief, integration may not 
always be desirable or deemed practical for a variety of 
reasons discussed throughout this paper.  Consequently, it 
appears reasonable that we need to know more about the 
specific nature of applications integration downsides in 
order to intelligently evaluate various integration 
strategies and arrive at prudent decisions.  Most 
practitioners and academic researchers seem to value 
integration.  However, the practicality of 100% 
integration is questionable. 
“The notion that a company can and ought to 
have an expert (or group of experts) create for it 
a single, completely integrated supersystem––an 
“MIS”––to help it govern every aspect of its 
activity is absurd” [29] cited in [14, p. 173]. 
Others also echo Dearden’s sentiment that the 
demands imposed by integration might be too great in 
some circumstances [27], [30].  Prompting these concerns 
are issues related to complexity, turbulent business

environments, short application lifecycles, and rapid 
technological changes.  These and other issues are 
discussed next. 
3.3. Integration Downsides and Concerns 
Eight integration concerns were found in the 
literature.  These concerns are briefly discussed below.
Loss of Control Issues – “Does…dependence [on 
vendors] have negative effects on organizations” [14]?  If 
an organization creates a system then their IT staff 
understands the system and are able to perform 
maintenance and add functionality.  This situation 
changes when software packages are purchased from a 
vendor.  Typically from a third party, consultants are 
hired to help with configuration, training, and 
implementations.  Even when the organization’s staff is 
deeply involved with learning the purchased software 
package, the organization must still rely on the vendor for 
new functionality and routine maintenance.   
Design Issues – “Rather than designing a system to 
meet the organization’s idiosyncratic ways of working, 
enterprise systems adopters often adjust the organization’s 
ways of working to fit the package (because modifying 
packages has numerous negative consequences)” [14].  
So, the advantages traditionally associated with 
requirements analysis are eliminated.   
Enterprise systems are typically designed to be 
tightly coupled.  This means the components 
(applications) were designed to work together and to use a 
common database.  On the surface this sounds good.  The 
problem is that it reduces flexibility and can have 
unintended negative side effects [31].  For instance, “The 
tight integration of all processes in an EWS [enterprise 
wide systems] package reminds one of the butterfly effect 
as discussed in relation to Chaos theory” [32]1.
Costs and Risks – Acquiring and implementing ERP 
systems can be both costly and risky.  Risks include 
picking the wrong vendor, disruption to operations, huge 
financial investments, and at the extreme, even 
bankruptcy [33].  Ross (1999) found that ERP 
implementations could be very disruptive and have 
adverse effects on employees including management [34].  
“…there is general consensus that business process 
change adds considerably to the expense and risk of an 
enterprise systems implementation.  The principal reason 
is the difficulty of managing large-scale human and 
organizational change” [14].   
1 Sor was referring to Gleick: “…a butterfly stirring the air in 
Peking today can transform (into) storm systems next month in 
New York” (1987, p 8). 
Organization Fit – Integration may not be 
appropriate for some organizational structures and 
business models [13].  Slater (1999) reported that Dell 
discontinued the implementation of an ERP system 
because of a lack of fit between the software package and 
Dell’s management style [35].  The volatile business 
environment requires agile companies that can constantly 
adapt.  However, organizations that change their 
organizational structures too often may find ERPs 
unsuitable [36].   
Cost and Competitive Advantage – It is widely 
known that ERP systems are costly to acquire and 
implement.  For example, Bailey (1999) reported that 
Allied Waste discontinued a $130 million computer 
system because it was considered too expensive and 
complicated to operate [37].  Fear of losing competitive 
advantages has been given as a reason by some firms for 
not implementing enterprise software [13].   
Complexity – Enterprise systems are challenging 
both technically and managerially.  ERP systems can 
contain over 10,000 tables and 1,000 plus business 
processes.  “Enterprise systems projects are managerially 
challenging, since they may involve parties from many 
different organizations and cut across the political 
structures of the organization” [14].  
Disintegration – The focus of enterprise systems has 
been on integration.  However, disintegration can be 
equally important and even more complex for 
multidivisional organization.  Reasons for disintegration 
include divestures and outsourcing [27].  Davenport 
(2000) believes it is unlikely that firms will devote much 
attention to the disaggregation [disintegration] issues [6].  
Best Practices – In theory, best practices represent 
the best way to conduct business.  However, the benefits 
derived depend on how the best practices are 
operationalized.  According to Sasovova et al. (2001), 
“The major constraint to the successful transfer of best 
practices is the nature of the innovation” [27].  Others, 
including Robey and Boudreau  (1999), have argued that 
technology does not guarantee success [16].  Even if best 
practices did consistently improve operations, this would 
level the playing field thereby likely causing negative 
competitive advantage problems.   
4. Methodology
4.1. Data Collection 
The data collected for this study was from semi-
structured interviews.  Fifty-one participants were 
interviewed from four organizations ranging from the 
public sector of higher education to large and mid-size 
private sector petro-chemical firms.  Each organization 
Proceedings of the 37th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2004
0-7695-2056-1/04 $17.00 (C) 2004 IEEE 3
included members of three stakeholder groups – 
senior/mid-level managers, IT professionals and end-
users.  Group interviews of three to five individuals from 
the same stakeholder group were conducted.  An 
interview guide was used, consisting of twelve semi-
structured, open-ended questions designed to surface 
practitioner perspectives related to the topics shown in 
Table 1.  This paper is only concerned with three of the 
twelve questions which dealt with downsides of 
applications integration.  Specifically, the questions were: 
1. Do you feel applications integration is desirable or 
undesirable?  Please explain why. 
2. Should all applications and data be integrated?  
Please explain.  
3. What are the disadvantages of applications 
integration (if any)? 
The above questions are part of a broader study that 
investigated the very essence of applications integration 
for enterprise systems [4].   
Interviews were approximately one hour in length 
and were tape-recorded.  Each interview session was 
opened by reading a brief statement about the research 
and the purpose of the interviews.  During the interviews, 
care was taken to avoid asking additional questions that 
might bias the responses.  Additional unscripted questions 
were asked if it became necessary to ensure that the 
interviewer understood a person’s input or to help get the 
discussion started after a period of silence.   
4.2. Data Analysis 
Content analysis was used to surface themes in the 
interview data that reflected practitioner understandings 
of applications integration.  The approach suggested by 
Weber (1990) was followed to code the interview data 
[38].  A set of codes used to classify the data was 
developed based on concepts from the research literature.  
The codes were later augmented with additional emergent 
ideas discovered by the researchers during the coding.   
Using a content analysis form developed for the 
study, each sentence from the interview transcripts was 
assigned one or more codes.  Each data element 
(sentence) was coded by two different people, the primary 
researcher and an IS doctoral student.  The coders then 
met to assess the level of agreement in code assignments.  
Discussion resulted in refinement of the initial set of 
codes.  The data was then recoded, again independently, 
by the two different coders.  Average overall inter-coder 
agreement was 67%.  However, the inter-coder agreement 
for the last two organizations coded was 74% reflecting 
much learning by the coders.  Krippendorf (1980) 
recommends that inter-rater reliabilities be greater than 
70% [39].  Considering this is the first known study that 
uses content analysis to investigate perceptions of 
integration downsides, 67% is considered acceptable. 
The final step in the analysis was to review all 
transcripts, results of the coding, and notes made by the 
researchers during the data collection/analysis process.  
Nine major themes, described in the next section were 
identified. 
5. Results
It is important to keep in mind that most discussions 
of applications integration are based on packaged 
software and the experiences that people have had with 
these packages.  Thus, most of the following comments 
are in the context of commercial ERP software packages. 
This section describes the analysis of the interview 
data.  Practitioners identified 31 unique downsides.  These 
items have been organized into five dimensions.  For 
discussion purposes, the results have been organized into 
major themes.  These themes paint an initial picture of the 
attitudes that practitioners have about the downsides of 
applications integration.  A number of specific downsides 
to integration were documented.  Some perceptions 
appeared invalid (at least on the surface) while others 
appeared factual.  Yet, most people preferred integration 
even while acknowledging the shortcomings.  The 
significance of this was that while integration was 
beneficial for many applications, 100% integration does 
not appear practical or desirable in most instances. 
Downsides of integration could be viewed as 
negative by pro-integration advocates.  However, there 
are some seemingly legitimate reasons not to seek 
integration or to avoid it.  At this point, it appears

appropriate to comment on the term downside.  
“Downside” has a negative connotation and does not 
always convey the correct or intended meaning.  
Sometimes “concern” is a better choice while at other 
times “challenge” is perhaps the better choice.  Therefore, 
references to downsides include both concerns and 
challenges as well as the more negative meaning. 
Table 2 lists five of the 31 most frequently cited 
concerns which account for about 42% of all concerns.  
Frequencies can be an indicator of the relative importance 
of the ideas related to applications integration for each of 
the stakeholder groups.  A more detailed summary 
showing category/dimension frequencies for each 
stakeholder group is shown in the appendix.   
Table 3 provides a summary of integration concerns 
by dimension.  From the table, we see that two of the five 
dimensions (Complexity and Risks) account for 55% of 
all downsides.  So it is not surprising that four of the top 
five most frequently cited concerns are from these two 
dimensions.  Most of the downsides seem consistent with 
prior research [14], [27]. 
5.1. Themes That Surfaced 
The following is a detail description of the nine 
themes that surfaced during the analysis. 
Employee Requirements Greater – Practitioners 
believe that you must have personnel with a higher skill 
level to adapt to an integrated system.  One person put it 
this way.  “You look at the personnel and you have people 
who have been able to perform jobs and functions before.  
And now all of a sudden, they can't because they simply 
don't have the skill level, the ability to understand the 
implication of what their job does and what happens 
[when they perform given actions] and it is so crucial that 
they understand that.” 
Clearly, it seems plausible that complex enterprise 
systems require a more knowledgeable staff.  For 
instance, another participant commented, “[Integration] 
requires people to have a global view of things.”  Some 
felt a reduced skill set was required of employees 
although the employee had to be more talented/capable.  
They argued that an integrated system created a problem 
for hiring and retaining qualified staff.   
Risks – A variety of risk were identified that 
included security concerns, data quality, dependence on a 
single vendor.  The following are examples of practitioner 
concerns.   
“[If] your end-users don't have a very clear 
understanding of what their transaction is going to 
cause to happen in the system, you create a nightmare 
because they don't realize the impact of every 
transaction that they do.”  
“If someone puts garbage in, it just ricochets through 
the system as garbage.”   
“If the end-user doesn't really know what they are 
doing and what the impact of their little piece of the 
pie is, it can be really bad.” 
A recurring theme was data security in terms of 
access.  A few participants were concerned to the point 
that they felt security was so important for certain data 
that it required data to be separate from other data.  Other 
security related concerns voiced were: 
“There is a risk that vendors don't respond timely to 
marketplace changes.”  
“[An enterprise system means] having all of your 
eggs in one basket.” 
“If the system fails, there is absolutely nothing you 
can do.  All the systems stay up together.  If you have 
one system and something happens, then everything 
stands still.” 
Maintenance More Difficult – Practitioners believe 
“There is more work involved when you change a process 
or adapt a new procedure when you change how your 
system works because you have to go all the way through 
and change all of the modules.”  Another person 
commented, “If the system is too big then it becomes 
almost impossible to do an upgrade.”

Complexity – Complexity was one of the two 
dimensions that accounted for over 55% of all concerns.  
Practitioners recognized the monolithic nature and hence 
the complexity of modern enterprise systems.  This seems 
to be reason for the following comments: 
 “If you have a problem at the end of the process, in 
order to reverse that problem, you have to back up 
across all processes and possibly across all functions.  
It becomes more complicated because it is 
integrated.” 
“Complexity and cost double.” 
“As you get more and more integrated, it gets so 
complex, you almost can't deal with it.” 
“A disadvantage is it makes it more difficult to 
identify the problem.  If everything is all integrated 
with one another and you are out of balance, how do 
you figure out where you are out of balance?” 
Flexibility – Flexibility was attacked on two fronts.  
First, people were concerned about the rigidity of 
integration in terms of functionality.  This led to the 
second concern that applications integration can adversely 
affect competition in some cases.  Some comments were: 
“Limits you when you are integrated, you are only 
allowed to go along the path of the integrated 
product.” 
“Lack of flexibility or slowness to adapt ERPs 
adversely affects speed to market for new products 
and services.” 
Functionality – Of course the heart of an enterprise 
system is the data.  However, we usually think of the 
functionality as representative of the system since 
functionality defines the systems capability.  
Functionality may therefore be the most debated aspect of 
enterprise systems and distinguishes one vendor from 
another.  Some typical complaints heard about 
functionality were: 
“You may sacrifice critical functionality.” 
“Functionality doesn't fully meet business 
requirements.” 
“I will use maintenance as an example.  Our 
maintenance department will tell you that they prefer 
to use a system outside of SAP to manage their 
maintenance task because it is a key to customized 
maintenance whereas within SAP you have your 
limitations.” 
Cost/Benefits – The cost/benefits of integrated 
enterprise systems has long been a subject of interest to 
researchers.  Clearly, organizations that implement these 
extremely expensive systems must believe the benefits 
justify the costs especially in view of the risks involved.  
Comments related to benefits and costs were: 
“Cost of change can be too high.” 
“It is very hard for us to imagine the benefits of 
integration up streaming and down streaming by 
using one integrated system.” 
“The additional efficiency that is actually gained 
from the system may not be enough to compensate 
how much it bogs down the system.” 
Rationale for Integration – In general, most 
practitioners interviewed felt that integration was a good 
thing.  Yet, for some, it seems they had a nagging doubt 
about integration for many situations.  In other words, 
integration is not always desirable and depends on the 
particular circumstances.  These concerns are reflected in 
the following remarks. 
“If your business is [not] integrated, why would you 
want your systems to be integrated.” 
“You can get led into integration for the sake of 
integration.” 
“Unless you are vigilant, you can start to integrate 
things that don't really need to be integrated.  In turn 
what you get is a very complex and difficult modified 
structure.”   
Data Issues – As mentioned earlier, data is the heart 
of any system.  Thus, concerns about data management 
seem perfectly natural.  Example comments were: 
“Something we always come across is, it seems like 
in an integrated environment the level of data quality 
needs to be a lot higher than you would have to have 
in an interfacing environment because you can sort of 
make compensating moves in an interfacing 
environment; whereas, you are dead alone with 
everyone else being dead if someone fouls up one 
piece of information.” 
“When you share information between offices and 
someone not in your office is looking at your 
information that information may not be properly 
interpreted.” 
“Some data just doesn't fit together.” 
6. Discussion
Many of the findings from this study appear to 
support prior research as discussed earlier in the literature 
section.  Chief among these are (1) loss of control, (2) 
costs and risks, (3) organizational fit, (4) complexity.  
Interestingly, one practitioner commented that, “I 
think you gain by integration but you also lose by 
Proceedings of the 37th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2004
0-7695-2056-1/04 $17.00 (C) 2004 IEEE 6
integration.”  Such comments are consistent with 
Filipczak’s view (1997) discussed earlier [28].  The 
comment also seems to summarize the commonly held 
view of the practitioners interviewed.  Integrated 
enterprise systems are thought to offer tremendous 
benefits but not for all situations.  ES implementation 
failures have been blamed on many things such as lack of 
upper management commitment.  Much research has been 
undertaken to identify critical success factors.  From this 
study, it seems some reasons for lack of success may be 
related to unavoidable downsides.  This is reminiscent of 
the comments from the movie, Oh, God! when God asks: 
“How do you make an ‘up without a down’ or a ‘front 
without back’?”  Understanding the downsides of 
integration allows us to address legitimate concerns and 
avoid costly mistakes.   
There seems to be a relationship between knowledge 
of enterprise systems and views of integration downsides.  
People with the most enterprise experience tended to be 
the most pragmatic.  They understand and readily admit 
the downsides and limits of integration.  For the most 
part, people with commercial enterprise systems felt that 
integration was still desirable even though they fully 
understood and acknowledged the numerous problems 
and challenges involved.  Therefore, it seems that 
knowledgeable practitioners understand that compromises 
must be made between cost, benefits, and risks.   
Integration downsides appeared to be exaggerated in 
some cases.  While many of the downsides are legitimate 
concerns, many are not.  Integration merely for the sake 
of integration is not desirable because it clearly implies 
expenditure of resources for no good reason.  On the other 
hand, objecting to others using your data because they 
might misinterpret the data does not appear legitimate.  
For instance, one end-user remarked that, “If you mess 
up, everybody knows about it immediately.”  Although 
the user viewed this as negative, this could be interpreted 
as positive from the organization’s viewpoint because 
such problems are more readily identified and therefore 
can be corrected more quickly. 
This study suggests that applications integration is a 
“fuzzy notion” for many practitioners.  Some practitioners 
may have pursued, and continue to pursue, applications 
integration without having a precise or deep 
understanding of exactly what it is they are seeking to 
achieve.  This is interesting since an understanding of 
what integration is seems to be a prerequisite to 
identifying integration downsides.  Nonetheless, 
practitioners seem to have a better grasp of the integration 
downsides than they do of what integration “is.”   
The major contribution of this study is that it has 
surfaced 31 practitioner perceptions of applications 
integration downsides.  Additionally, five downside 
dimensions have been identified.  These findings should 
be important to future IS research since such perceptions 
influence actions and decisions as organizations seek to 
leverage enterprise systems investments. 
7. Summary and Conclusions 
This paper reports the findings from the analysis of 
in-depth interviews of 51 practitioners from four different 
organizations that represent three stakeholder groups 
regarding downsides to applications integration.  Thirty-
one downsides representing five dimensions were 
revealed.  In spite of these downsides, virtually everyone 
interviewed believed that integration is desirable although 
not for all situations.   
Numerous opportunities are available for additional 
research and include: 
• Creating an instrument to measure applications 
integration downsides 
• Replicating this study  
• Investigating the implications of applications 
integration downsides
