Abstract- When dealing with multiobjective optimization of 
the tyre-suspension system of a racing car, a large number of 
design variables and a large number of objectives have to be 
taken into account. Two dflerent models have been used, both 
validated on data coming from an instrumented car, a differential 
equation based physical model and a neural network purely 
numerical model. Up to 13 objective functions have been defined, 
at least 14 of which showing to be in strict clash each other. 
The equivalent scalar function based formulation is intentionally 
avoided due to its well known limitations. A fuzzy definition of 
optima, being a generalization of Pareto-optimality, is applied to 
the problem. The result of such an approach is that subsets 
of Pareto-optimal solutions (being on such a problem a big 
portion of the entire search space) can be properly selected as a 
consequence of inputs from the designer. The obtained optimal 
solutions are compared with the reference vehicle and with the 
optima previously obtained with design of experiments techniques 
and different MO optimization strategies. 
1. INTRODUCTION 
The notion of Pareto Optimality and the related notion of 
Pareto dominance, are the basic concepts for the development 
of multiobjective optimization theory and algorithms, both in 
the community of ”classical” multiobjective optimization [ I ]  
and in the community of evolutionary multiobjective optimiza- 
tion (EMO) [2].  When looking at both classical multiobjective 
optimization and at the twenty years of E M 0  history, it can 
be easily concluded that almost all algorithms have aimed at 
converging towards either a particular Pareto-optimal solution 
(classical methods) or towards the entire Pareto-optimal front, 
which is the set of optimal solutions in the Pareto sense 
(EM0 methods) [3]. This is essentially due to the fact that 
both classical and evolutionary multiobjective optimization 
algorithms have been mostly developed and addressed to 
engineering design problems. In such area the number of 
objectives is usually not huge hut the computation of such 
objectives is time-consuming and highly complex [4]. 
Nevertheless, when problems with a number of objectives 
relatively larger than two or three were considered in the 
above framework, the limitations of Pareto optimality came 
out-both for classical and evolutionary methods-to give an 
unmanageable and large set of Pareto Optimal solutions; re- 
searchers subsequently developed a wide variety of techniques 
for the visualization, additional classification and choice of 
Pareto optimal solutions [SI.

The reason for the limitations that one encounters when 
using the PO definition in multi-criteria optimization problems, 
is that Pareto’s definition [6] captures the notion of “optimal- 
ity” in a narrowly prescribed sense, several different concepts 
of “optimality” can thus be introduced and considered 171. 
More into details, in Pareto’s definition, when comparing two 
solutions, the following three aspects are not taken into con- 
sideration: the number of improved (or decreased) objectives, 
the relevance of such improvements (or decreases) and the 
decision maker’s preferences between objectives (if any). All 
three issues are crucial in the human decision making process 
and may lead to several degrees of dominance, when two 
solutions are compared and, consequently, to several degrees 
of optimality among Pareto optimal solutions. 
The first issue, regarding the number of improved objectives, 
is tackled in [SI where the authors also consider an additional 
weighting procedure for the incorporation of preferences (the 
third issue) as crisp weighting coefficients. The joint consid- 
eration of both the number of improved objectives and prefer- 
ences gives a very compact definition of optimality, but a more 
simple and effective way for a proper numerical formalization 
of decision maker’s preferences, is the use of the fuzzy set 
theory. This leads to a very general definition of fuzzy dom- 
inance and optimality where the decision maker’s linguistical 
knowledge of preferences is numerically formalized; a widely 
developed theory on this is already available in literature [9],  
and [IO]. The natural application of such work is in the field 
of many-criteria decision making (MCDM) problems where 
the decision maker’s preferences have a leading role in the 
decision making process; an example of such a preference- 
based linguistic decision making procedure can be found in 
Differently, the aim of the present work is to exclude 
preferences from the optimization process and to consider 
fuzzy memberships as a tool for the numerical formalization 
and treatment of the size of improvements in the domi- 
nance definition [12]. The natural field of application of such 
an approach is mostly multiobjective optimal design with 
several criteria (more than three), where objective functions 
are numerical crisp functions, being eventually very complex 
and computationally very expensive. In the case of problems 
where preferences are to be included in the optimization, 
[ I l l .  
a good overview of current research on this topic in the 
EM0 community is given in [I31 and [14] and a technique 
for transforming non-crisp (qualitative) relationships between 
objectives into quantitative attributes is presented in [15]. 
Moreover, when tackling conflicting design problems with 
multiobjective optimization, it is often important to remove 
any bias deriving from the decision maker's preferences and to 
compute "unbiased" solutions. An example of such a problem, 
can be found in [16] where the optimal design of a controller 
for a gas turbine is formulated as a 6-objective multiobjective 
optimization problem. 
Another example, related to industrial design, can be found 
in 151, where a 4-objective problem is tackled and a complex 
strategy, based on self-organizing maps, is developed for the 
visualization of PO solutions and for the a posteriori selection. 
Unlike what happens in multi-criteria decision making, when 
dealing with MO, even four objectives only are sufficient for 
an unaffordable complexity in the space of Pareto-optimal 
solutions. Several examples of design problems with a huge 
number of objectives can be found in the automotive design 
field [17]. In [I81 a 17 objective problem is tackled, for 
the design of a full car chassis where no preference-biased 
solutions are required. PO solutions are computed and the 
difficulty encountered in the choice among them is clearly 
outlined. The same happens in [I71 where a 14 objective 
problem is formalized for the optimal design of the tyre- 
suspension system of a racing car. When dealing with such 
problems, the automotive expert would be strongly interested 
in computing a sampling of the entire Pareto front, with- 
out introducing any preference-based bias, but this may be 
unpractical due to the high number of objectives. For this 
reason, the computation of a proper suh-set of the PO front, 
corresponding to a higher degree of optimality and based 
on the definitions given in the present paper, gives a wide 
variety of choice possibilities with no preference based biases. 
The extended definitions of k-optimality and fuzzy-optimality 
can be applied to multiobjective optimization problems at 
two levels. Level 1: a-posteriori selection of non-dominated 
solutions obtained via available MOEAs. Level 2: development 
of new algorithms directly converging towards the k-front 
(or fuzzy front) Results will be shown related to the first 
approach. Fuzzy-optimality and k-optimality are thus linked 
to a complex set of techniques in order to make practical 
the procedure of automated optimal design on such problems. 
The entire' procedure requires the exploitation of differential 
modelling, NN modelling, design of experiments, statistical 
correlation analysis, Evolutionary multiobjective optimization 
and validation (through comparison with real data) of each 
step. The overall schema of the computational procedure is 
shown in figure 1. Although the main subject of the paper is 
fuzzy and k optimality, some details about the entire procedure 
and its blocks will be given.

11. FUZZY DEFINITION OF OPTIMA FOR MULTIOBJECTLVE 
OPTIMIZATION 
The following multi-objective optimization problem is con- 
Def 2.1 (Multi-criteria optimization problem): Let V 
sidered [I], [19], [ZO]: 
K1 x KZ x . . .  x KN and W C O1 x Oz x . . _  x On4 be 
vector spaces, where Ki,Oj (with i = 1,. . . , N and j = 
1,. . . , M) are (continuous or finite) fields. Let N ,  M E W, and 
f : V H W be a mapping. A Non-linear constrained mulri- 
criteria (minimum) optimization problem with M objectives is 
defined as: 
where S2 is a nonempty subset of V. 
The set f? is referred to as design (domain) search space, 
or feasible region. Its image n o  = f(n) is referred to as 
objective (domain) search space, or feasible objective region. 
The set f? is defined and bounded by two constraintfunctions 
g : V H RP, h : V U Wq, where p ,  q E N as follows: 
n= {V E V 1 g(v) I 0 A h(v )  = 0). (2) 
When design optimization is concerned, V = W N  and 
W = P'; consequently each f i  is a mapping from W N  
to Iw. Moreover, for better clarity and simplicity and with 
no loss of generality, we assume that all objective functions 
are to be minimized. If an objective function f i  is to be 
maximized, all formulas still holds for the minimization of 
- f,. For the reader's convenience, we recall here the well 
known definition of Pareto dominance (definition 2.2), Pareto 
optimum (definition 2.3) and Pareto set and front (definition 
2.4 in a multi-criteria ( M  criteria) optimization problem. v 
is the decision (or design) variables vector, it belongs to the 
search space R. 
Def 2.2 (Pareto dominance): For any two points (candi- 
date solutions) v1,vz E 0, v1 is said to dominate vz in 
10 
the Pareto sense (P-dominate) if and only if the following 
conditions hold 
fi(v1) 5 ft(vz) for all i E {1 ,2 ,  ..., M }  
fj(v1) < fj(v2) for at least one j (3) { E {1,2,  ..., M }  
Def 2.3 (Pareto optimality): v* E fl is Pareto-optimal (P- 
optimal) if there is no v E R such that v P-dominates v*. 
De$ 2.4 (Pareto set andfront): We call Pareto Optimal Set 
(Sp) and Pareto Optimal Front ( 3 p )  the set of Pareto-optimal 
solutions in design variables domain and objective functions 
domain, respectively. 
When considering a big number of objectives, the Pareto def- 
inition of optimality in a multi-criteria optimization problem 
can be unsatisfactory due to essentially three reasons: 
P I  the number of improved objective functions values is not 
taken into account, 
P2 the (normalized) relevance of the improvements is not 
taken into account. 
P3 no preference among objectives is considered. 
Such issues are essential decision elements when looking for 
the best solution, and they are implicitly included in the 
common-sense notion of optimality. 
When no preferences are prescribed by the designer (P3), in 
order to account for P1 and P2, in the following sections we 
will give two more general definitions of optimum for a multi- 
criteria optimization problem. One Pi issue at a time will be 
taken into account, and the definitions will be introduced in 
such a way that the classical Pareto optimum definition will 
be a special case for both the definitions. 
A. PI: Taking into account the number of improved objectives: 
k-optimality 
When the Pareto optimality definition is considered, two 
solutions VI and v:! (to be compared) are equivalent, if at least 
in one objective the first solution is better than the second one, 
and at least in one objective the second one is better than the 
first one (or if they are equal in all the objectives). Indeed 
a more general definition, being able to cope with a wider 
variety of problems, should take into account the number of 
objectives where the first candidate solution is better than the 
second one and viceversa. Let us first introduce the following 
functions, which relate a natural number to each couple of 
points in R. 
%(vi,v:!) E Nli 5 M A  f<(vi) < fdvz)}l (4) 
n,(vl,vz) H i  E NIi 5 M A  f i ( v ~ )  = f<(v~)}l (5)  
nw(Virv2) l{i E Nli S M A  f , ( v ~ )  > f , (v~)}l  (6) 
For each couple of points V I ,  v:! E R, the function nb counts 
those objectives where VI is better than v2, ne counts those 
objectives where the two solutions are equal, and nul counts 
those objectives where VI is worse than v2. To lighten the 
mathematical notation, from now on we will consider a generic 
couple of points and we will write simply nb,n, and n, 
instead of nb(vl,vz),n,(vi,vz) and nW(v1,vz). Obviously, 
the following inequalities hold 
natn ,+n ,  = M ,  (7) 
0 < nb,n,,n, < M (8) 
We are now able to give a first new definition of dominance 
and optimality, namely (1-k)-dominance and k-optimality: 
De$ 2.5 ((I-k)-dominance): v1 is said to (I-k)-dominate 
v2 if and only i f  
where 0 5 k 5 1. 
As can be easily seen, 1-dominance (i.e., k = 0) is nothing 
else than Pareto-dominance (definition 2.2). Ideally k may 
assume any value in [0,1], but because na has to be a natural 
number, only a limited number of optimality degrees need to 
be considered. In fact in equation (9) the second inequality is 
equivalent to 
M - ne 
nb [TTTl’ 
where r.1 is the ceiling operation (1.1 is the smallest integer 
greater than the real 2). After defining (1-k)-dominance, the 
following definition of optimality can be given: 
Def 2.6 (k-optimality): v* is k-optimum if and only if 
there is no v E R such that v k-dominates v* 
The meaning of the terms “(1-k)-dominance” and “k- 
optima1ity”is that the former is a loose version of Pareto 
dominance (1-dominance), while the latter is a strong version 
of Pareto optimality (0-optimality). Concepts of S p  and 3p 
can be now easily extended in the following way: 
Def 2.7 (k-optimal set and front ): We call the k-optimal 
set ( S k )  and the k-optimal front ( 3 h )  the set of k-optimal 
solutions in the design variables domain and in the objective 
functions domain, respectively. 
Several Sk sets and 3 h  fronts are thus introduced, one for each 
value of k ;  moreover, as evident, SO is the Pareto Optimal set 
(Sp), and 30 is the Pareto Optimal Front (Fp). 
B. P2: Taking into account the size of improvements: Fuzzy 
optimality 
A simple and effective extension of of (I-k)-dominance and 
k-optimality is to substitute crisp relations in Eqs. 6 with fuzzy 
ones. As a first step, for each objective function, the degree 
of improvement (or equality) between two points v1 and v2 
is taken into account. In order to do this fuzzy numbers and 
fuzzy arithmetic will be considered. As a second step, we 
extend the dominance relation itself to a fuzzy relation. We 
remark that, in this work, fuzzy set theory is not related to 
treatment of preferences among objectives, but it is related to 
the size of the improvements, with the underlying hypothesis 
that all objectives have equal importance. 
The standard way to introduce fuzzy arithmetic (here being 
the objective domain search space Ro), is to relate to each 
point in no three fuzzy sets (fuzzy number), one for equality, 
one for “greater than” and one for “less than”. For coherence 
with the terminology used so far, we refer to the membership 
function as be, pw (where w means “worst” and where we 
are talking about minimization problems) and p b  respectively. 
The fuzzy definition of nb, nu, and ne (now with superscript 
F )  are the following 
M 
nF(v1,Vz)  d Cpt’(f i (v1)  - ~ z ) )  
nc (Vl rVZ)  4 Cw$’(f;(vl) - f d v z ) )  
n r ( v 1 , V z )  CpP’(fi(~1) - f i W )  (12) 
(10) 
,=I  
M 
(11) 
i=l  
M 
i= l  
In order n [ , n z  and n: to be a meaningful extension 
of nb,n,  and n e ,  the membership functions p r ) , p $ )  and 
p?’ have to satisfy the Ruspini condition [21] and thus, 
in all the domain, they must sum up to 1 (For a detailed 
description of the Ruspini condition role in fuzzy membership 
function definition, see [22]). In fact, under this hypothesis, the 
following holds 
M 
n r  + n,” + ng = X ( p !  + pLy + p:) = M 
Two possible different membership shapes, linear and gaus- 
sian, can be considered. For both of them The shape definition 
requires some parameters being E,  and yi for the linear 
one and ui for the gaussian one. Although the definition of 
such parameters is to he carefully considered, their intended 
meaning is clear and closely related to the physical properties 
of the system. They thus can be provided by the human 
decision-maker knowledge on the system. 
(13) 
i=l 
ci defines in a fuzzy way the practical meaning of 
equality and it can thus be considered the tolerance on 
the i-th objective, that is the interval within which an im- 
provement on objective i is meaningless (in other words 
the maximum imperceptible improvement on objective i). 
T~ can be defined as a relevant, but not big, size improve- 
ment for objective i. 
ui evaluation requires a combination of the two afore- 
mentioned parameters &) and -/,; the following formula 
for the membership pe can be used: 
C. k-optimalily with fuzzy numbers of improved objectiws: 
fuzzy optimalily 
At first the following extended definitions of k-dominance 
and k-optimality can be given. l i b .  n. and nul a e  replaced by 
n:, n% and n; in definitions 2.5 and 2.6. 
De$ 2.8 ((1-kp)-dominance): V I  is said to ( I - k F ) -  
dominate v2 if and only i f  
1: 15) 
where 0 5 kp 5 1. 
With the above definition, once k p  is provided, it is easy 
to check whether a candidate solution (I-kp)-dominates or 
not another solution. A simple extension can be given for 
definition 2.6 as follows: 
De$ 2.9 (kp-optimality): v* is kp-optimum if and only if 
there is no v E R such that v kp-dominates v* 
The parameter k (now called k,~) has the same meaning as in 
the previous case (0 5 5 l), but now continuous degrees 
of optimality and dominance are introduced (kp-domin;ince 
and kf-optimality). 
Moreover, an extension of Sk and 3 k  can be defined as 
follows: 
De$ 2.10 (kF-optimal set andfront): We call S k r  and 
FkkF the set of kp-optimal solutions in the design variables 
domain and in the objective functions domain, respectively. 
111. THE SYSTEM MODELS AND OPTIMIZATION PROBLEM 
A. Differential equation based model 
A vehicle model, divided into modules, has been con- 
structed. Each module is an object which interacts with the 
other ones by means of inpuvoutput variables. The result is a 
18 d.0.f. model that simulates satisfactory the actual vehicle 
dynamic behavior. The car chassis is considered as a rigid body 
(6 d.0.f.). The tyre forces transmitted by the suspension system 
are applied to the vehicle body by considering two resultant 
forces and two torques. The vehicle body is subject to aerody- 
namic lift and drag forces. Front and rear independent suspen- 
sion systems have a double wishbone layout. Shock absorbers 
are modelled as non-linear components; the forces transmitted 
by the shock absorber are function of the deformation speed. 
The non-linearity due to bump stop characteristics has been 
included. The torques-speed characteristic of the differential 
has been accurately modelled. A model of braking system is 
included by considering different distribution of braking force 
at the front and rear axle. The tyre characteristics have been 
implemented by using the Pacejkn’s Magic Formulre[23]. The 
transient tyre behavior (relaxation length effect) is given by

p b  and pw be univocally derived from Ruspini’s 
condition. 
With such a fuzzy definition of n[, n: and n$ both (I-k)- 
dominance and k-optimality definition can be easily extended. 
where sigma is the relaxation length, Fy is the lateral force, 
cy is the slip angle, F, is the vertical load acting on the tyre 
and -/ is the camber angle. Combined effects of longitudinal 
and lateral slip have been considered as described in [24]. The

vehicle model has been extensively validated, see [25j, [I81 
for more details. 
B. Design of Experiments and NN based model 
Once a satisfactorily uniform and large set of training points 
has been selected through a proper design of experiments 
technique (see 1261, 1271 for more details), three MLPs (Multi- 
Layer Percept”) have been trained for the approximation 
of objectives being grouped into three sets (being defined by 
common features of objectives belonging to the sets). Mean 
values and standard deviations on both training and gener- 
alization errors are shown in Table I. When using the MLPs 
model for the optimization the one-shot approach (compute the 
model Once and then optimize) can be very time consuming 
due to the high accuracy required in the model that cannot be 
improved once the optimization is started. This is why results 
obtained with an iterative interpolation-optimization strategy 
[28] will be shown in the conference presentation. 
C. Optimization problem formulation 
The design variables that have be considered in the optimi- 
sation process are 22, as reported in Table U. The objective 
functions are obtained from the simulation of a total number 
of six running situations. The maneuvers considered are the 
steady state cornering with a path radius of 50m and 120771 
respectively (IS0 4138 standard), j-turn maneuver (IS0 7401 
standard), power on-off while steering, braking on a bend and 
passing over a non symmetric kerb. A total of 23 objective 
functions have been considered, as they are reputed fully 
representative of the actual vehicle behavior. The objective 
functions are reported in Table 111. From a general point of 
view, when such a big number of objective is considered, 
some of them may be treated as constrains. The approach has 
been discarded due to the arbitrariness in the choice and for

D. Objective correlation analysis 
In order to reduce, if possible, the number of performance 
indexes that have to be taken into account, the correlation 
between performance indices has been investigated. The statis- 
tic we used to measure correlation between each objective 
couple is the Spearman’s non-parametric correlation statistic 
[29j. Spearman’s correlation is used in preference to the 
other commonly applied non-parametric correlation statistics 
(e. g. Kendall’s tau [29]) because the latter proved to be too

solution wilh the refenace vehicle and with minima 
solutions (16152) have been obtained. Moreover utopia, 
distopia, nadir and payoff matrix have been computed through 
single-objective evolutionary computation (ES). After that k- 
dominance and fuzzy-dominance has been considered as an 
a-posteriori selection rule among Pareto-based non-dominated 
solutions. The results of different selections at different values 
of k and k.r are shown in table V. For the sake of comparison 
a selection has also been done on a set of 631701 non- 
dominated solutions corresponding to a search space sampling 
of lo6 points. As can he seen the number of selected non- 
dominated solutions becomes smaller for high values of k, 
making possible the final solution selection. Moreover column 
three of table V shows the meaning of k-optimality that is the 
minimum number of improved objective functions that one 
counts when considering all possible couples of k-optimal so- 
lutions at different values of k. When fuzzy optimality is used 
for the selection na becomes a real number (see section 11). 
Focusing the attention on results corresponding to k=0.6 (Table 
V, +), a comparison in objective space domain is shown in 
figure 4 between k-optimal solutions, reference vehicle and 
two different optima corresponding to previously computed 
minima by using scalar function approach. One possible com- 
bination of three among the 13 conflicting objectives is shown. 
As it can be seen, almost all k-optimal solutions dominates 
the reference solution and are significantly close to the utopia 
point. Moreover a set of 256 solutions is in some way practical 
for the final choice by the designer. kp-optimality can be used 
for the choice of one final solution. This can be seen from the 
last line in Table V (f = 0.8). The selected solution is shown 
in figure 5 and 6 in the phenotypic space of the sideslip angle 
at c.g. (versus time) and centripetal acceleration (versus time) 
respectively. The compasison is performed with the reference 
vehicle and with previous optima (see above). The selected

One k-aplimd solution in the phenotipic space of sideslip angle at 
k-optimal solution shows a relevant improvement on both the 
objectives with respect to the reference vehicle and to both 
previously computed optima. 
V. CONCLUSION 
The multiobjecive optimization of the tyre-suspension sys- 
tem of a racing car has been tackled. The problem has shown 
to be highly challenging mainly due to the high number of 
objectives to be considered (totally 24 with 13 conflicting each 
other). Several approaches have been followed involving state 
of the art evolutionary optimization algorithms (NSGAII) both 
on the differential model and on the NN model. Nevertheless 
the number of objectives is so large, that a huge number of 
non-dominated solutions have been obtained among which it 
is difficult to make any a-posteriori choice. In order to solve 
the problem a different definition of optimality (previously

developed) has been applied to the problem. It has shown to 
be significantly flexible both as an a-posteriori selection rule 
among non-dominated solutions and as an extension to Pareto 
dominance definition to be included in the available mul- 
tiohjective evolutionary algorithms. Some results are shown 
and compared to the actual vehicle behaviour and to some 
additional optima obtained through a classical scalar function 
approach.
