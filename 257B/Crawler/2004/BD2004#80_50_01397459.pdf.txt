Abstract- Short term load forecasting is a recurrent topic in 
the operative planning activities of companies dedicated to the 
distribution and trade of energy around the world due to the 
competitive electricity market, in which an advantage in the 
previous knowledge of demand could mean the difference 
between obtaining big benefits or incur in economic losses. 
In this paper a novel method for short term load forecasting is 
proposed based on the similar day approach and the use of Soft 
Compnting techniques. This approach is founded on the search 
for the most similar day in history, to the forecasted day, based 
on the explanatory meteorological variables forecast for the load 
of this day. Once the "similar" day is found, the load forecast 
will be the same of that day with an adjustment for load growth. 
LAMDA-fuzzy-clustering techniques, regression trees, CART 
classification and fuzzy inference for the peak power, daily 
energy and load curve forecast are used. 
The validation of the proposed method is made with 
meteorological and load data from a Colombian city.

I. INTRODUCTION 
T he art of load forecasting, particularly short tenn, became one of the top growing areas of study and 
significance since the emergence of competition in the 
energy markets. After the privatization and deregulation 
tendency of power systems in many countries, including 
Colombia among them, the purchase and sale of energy in 
this new market constitute the base of business for the 
distribution and electricity trade companies. 
For these companies it is vital to have good knowledge, or to 
obtain a good forecast of the short term load with the purpose 
of fixing prices in advance, according to their service supply 
costs. This contributes to these companies savings, for 
example in Great Britain, the savings were in the order of US 
$30 millions for a 4% improvement in load forecasting [1]. 
Diverse methods for short term load forecasting have been 
tested with different degrees of success. There are two main 
tendencies of models for short term forecast: the causal or 
conventional models, which outline the relationships among 
load and factors influencing it, mainly social and weather 
variables; and the time series models which outline the 
relationships with values observed in the past. 
The model presented in this paper is based in the similar day 
approach and a forecast for the load curve, the peak power 
and the daily energy consumed is achieved.

The "similar day" approach has been used in forecasting 
applications where the dependent variable is highly correlated 
with the meteorological variables and the calendar location. 
The method proposes to search in history a very similar day 
based in some known explaining independent variables, 
generally of climate and time (day of the week, month, etc.) 
and to predict the dependent variable, in this case the electric 
energy demand, in accordance to what had happened to this 
variable in the similar day found. It is important to note that 
in this method there are no mathematical functions found for 
the explaining variables. 
The hourly electric load in a Colombian coast located 
company and the hourly temperature of the corresponding 
city are used for the research development. The data used for 
methodology validation go from January 1998 to June 2000. 
II. STATE OF THE ART 
Conventional methods in short-term load forecasting are 
among others: regression models, ARIMA, ARIMAX or 
SARIMAX models [2], Box and Jenkins transfer functions 
[3], optimization techniques [4], non-parametric regression, 
structural models, curve adjustment procedures and there are 
some more recent methods whose results are compared with 
the ones mentioned such as expert systems [5], artificial 
neural networks [6], fuzzy inference [7] and Neuro-fuzzy 
models [8]. 
The load to forecast in the system is a random non-stationary 
process composed by thousands of individual components. 
Therefore, the range of possible approaches to the forecast is 
wide. Usually the only possibility is to take a macroscopic 
view of the problem, and try to model the future load as a 
reflection of previous behavior. This still leaves open space 
to very different solutions. Due to the nature of load, the only 
objective method to evaluate the approaches is experimental 
evidence [9]. 
Expert systems have been also used in load forecasting. 
These systems are heuristic models, which usually can 
include both quantitative and qualitative factors. A typical 
approach is trying to imitate the reasoning of a human 
operator. The idea then is to reduce the analogical thought 
behind the intuitive forecasting to formal logic steps. A 
popular approach has been to develop rules based on fuzzy 
logic [9]. 
Another important technique in short term load forecasting is 
the neural network. In these models, the network inputs 
generally are present and past load values and the outputs are 
future load values. The network is trained using real load 
data from the past [10]. 
There have also been suggested models with no-supervised 
learning for load forecasting. The purpose of these models 
can be the classification of days in different types of day, or 
to choose the most appropriate days in history to be used as 
base for the real load forecasting. 
III. MODEL PROPOSED 
In the method proposed in this paper peak power and daily 
energy forecasts are made in order to predict the load curve, 
looking for the most similar day in history based on the 
meteorological forecasts for tomorrow's day. It is achieved 
using classification and identification with LAMDA and 
CART methodologies, obtaining and implementing a rule 
based Fuzzy Inference System and the similar day approach. 
A. STAGE 0: Data Analysis 
The data used for methodology validation go from January of 
1998 to June of 2000. For a more complete proof, load data 
of a longer period of time would be preferred. 
Some cyclical effects for the load data, see Figure 1, can be 
observed starting from the working day; the weekend rhythm 
is followed by most people. In labor days social activities are 
in a higher level than in Saturdays and Sundays, therefore the 
load is also higher. The series begins with five quite similar 
patterns that are the Monday to Friday load curves. Next two 
different patterns continue for Saturday and Sunday. Then 
this same weekly pattern is repeated [ 10].

On the other hand the daily rhythm takes place because of the 
synchronous behavior of people during the day. Most of 
people sleep at night; consequently the demand is low during 
night hours. Also during the day, many activities tend to be 
simultaneous for most of people (labor schedule, lunch hour, 
etc.). The daily rhythm changes throughout the year [10]. 
There are also differences between days of the same month or 
meteorological condition. Therefore, in load forecasting days 
are often divided in numerous types of day, each has its own 
characteristic load patterns. Saturdays and Sundays have 
different load curves than other days. Often Mondays and/or 
Fridays also separate from other labor days, because the 
proximity of weekend can have a slight effect in load [10]. 
In the proposed model the explanatory variables used for the 
forecast were: the day of the week, the type of day (classified 
as labor, weekends and holidays) and the meteorological 
conditions of the day to which the load is to be predicted. 
B. STAGE I: LAMDA to determine the similar day 
The similar day technique is founded on the search for the 
most similar day in history to tomorrow, or to the day to 
predict, based on the explanatory meteorological variables for 
the electric power consumption. 
The objective is that with the meteorological forecasting for 
tomorrow, or for the day to predict, the most similar day in 
history can be found. Some software programs, available in 
the market, look for the most similar day using clustering 
methods with neural networks. 
In the work developed the LAMDA (Learning Algorithm 
Multivariate Data Analysis) classification method is proposed 
to be used with this aim. LAMDA was chosen because it 
shows some advantages that other classification systems don't 
have. One of these is determining the number of clusters, 
without being the user who decides the input space partition, 
and this is not excessive. Another interesting feature is that it 
can be chosen whether the supervised or the not supervised 
classification is used [11]. 
LAMDA is a fuzzy classification method that is rooted in the 
adequacy degree analysis of each object to a class, concept 
related with the membership degree to a fuzzy set. The 
contribution of each one of the attributes or individual's 
describers, to the membership degree to a class is called 
marginal adequacy (MAD, Marginal Adequacy Degree). 
These marginal adequacies are combined with the use of 
"Fuzzy Mixed" operators to finally fmd the adequacy degree 
of the individual to each one of the classes (GAD, Global 
Adequacy Degree) [11]. 
As no pattern was known to determine similar days it was 
necessary to carry out first not supervised classification, so 
that later supervised classification could be done in such a 
way that when entering a new day (individual), the algorithm 
was able to identify at least one (1) most similar day. 
The "learning" consists on fmding parameters defming each 
one of the classes' describers. The type of parameters and the 
way to fmd them depends on whether the work is done with 
quantitative or qualitative describers, and the means to 
determine them depends on whether a supervised learning is 
being carried out or not [11]. 
A non information class exists (NIC=Non Informative Class), 
which determines the minimum threshold of global adequacy 
that an individual should have in order to belong to some 
2 
class. In the case of supervised learning, the individuals that 
don't overcome the GAD of the NIC class are said not to 
belong to any of the classes. For not supervised learning, 
starting from the NIC parameters and the individual that was 
not classified, a new class is generated. So starting from only 
one group, all the individuals are fmally classified locating 
them in groups that are generated depending on the GAD's. 
For the similar day identification, the IDEAM (Colombian 
institution for meteorology) made possible the access to their 
meteorological database. Basically data of years 1998, 1999 
and 2000 were obtained. However there were problems with 
the database as it was not fully completed and the variables 
measures are not hourly taken. Therefore the variables used 
for obtaining the similar day are the following: average 
temperature and average humidity in the morning, afternoon, 
and night of the next and current day; solar shine in the 
morning and afternoon of the current day; average speed of 
the winds in the morning, afternoon, and night of the current 
day; maximum and minimum speeds of the winds in the 
current day and maximum and minimum temperature in the 
next and current day. 
Once the variables were chosen, tests on the not supervised 
classification were made with the software elaborated by the 
control group of the Universidad de Los Andes. Several 
simulations with different demand values and distributions 
were made using 900 of the base of 1088 data for training, 
because in this type of problem there is one seasonal pattern 
per year and it was important to try to embrace all of the 
possible cases. 
After the tests it was determined that the best distribution for 
classifying data was the normal when the demand parameter 
is 0.39 since the number of classes is not excessive and the 
classification is more homogeneous that in other cases. The 
result of not supervised classification is shown in Figure 2.

C. STAGE II: Forecast for peak power and daily energy 
1) Part a: Search of relevant variables and obtaining ofif­
then Rules using CART 
Once made the daily load curve analysis it was decided to 
forecast the peak power and the daily energy, other important 
data such as the load factor and the minimum power were not 
forecasted since they are quite constant with the test data. 
CART is a classification and regression trees algorithm. It 
makes supervised classification and it can find the decision 
rules of the cluster and in the application for load forecasting 
it was used for this purpose only after the classification with 
LAMDA was completed. 
As the clusters had already been determined, it was necessary 
to determine whether all the variables were relevant, or if it 
was better to add other non meteorological variables in order 
to obtain better functions of Takagi Sugeno type for the 
defuzzyfication. This way, several models were suggested 
depending on meteorological variables, the day of the week, 
the type of day and the variable to predict in previous times. 
With CART it was found that the meteorological variables, 
the type of day and the day of the week were enough to make 
the peak power and energy forecasts. When autoregressive 
models were used, that is, the output in previous times, the 
error obtained was similar to the model that only uses 
meteorological data but the more autoregressive the output 
was the less necessary the meteorological variables were. 
Once defmed the clusters and variables, if-then rules were 
also found for the fuzzy inference system using CART. 
However CART only provides Takagi - Sugeno rules of zero 
order, which was not the optimum for the problem. This was 
solved using least minimum squared on each cluster as later 
explained. 
As example, in the decision tree obtained for peak power one 
of the rules obtained is: 
If the day type is weekend or holiday and the average speed of winds of the 
current day in the afternoon is more than 4.45 and the humidity of the 
current day is' less than or equal to 94.5 and the temperature of the next day 
in the night is less than or equal to 26.95 then the peak power of the next day 
is of 436873. 
2) Part b: Takagi- Sugeno (T S) Rule A4justment using least 
minimum squared regressions 
With the CART algorithm the classification rules for each 
cluster were found but of zero order (a constant value), 
therefore it was necessary to make an adjustment to that 
regression. We proceeded to make the regressions using least 
minimum squared. 
There were found excellent adjustments in several clusters 
that exceeded all the statistical tests, this means, the t test that 
indicates the adjustment tolerance of each variable, the F test 
that indicates the global adjustment tolerance of the model 
and the value of R squared that indicates how much can the 
model forecast. However, there were also found clusters 
where the value of R squared did not exceed 0.6 (fairly good) 
and the value of F was barely more than the critical F, but in 
spite of this in the great majority of cases the typical error of 
adjustment was less than in the case where the rule was left 
with a constant value. In the cases where the defuzzyfication 
3 
of the rule is constant, it is because the quantity of cluster 
data was too small as to use least minimum squared. 
Also in some of the clusters it was found that a fairly good 
model with the explanatory variables did not exist, so that a 
division of the cluster had to be made depending on the day 
type or the day of the week, for example, the cluster 23 had 
the following rule: 
If the day of the week is Monday or Tuesday or Wednesday or Thursday or 
Friday and the average speed of the winds of the current day is more than to 
3.75 and the temperature in the night of the next day is less than or equal to 
27.15 and. ••••••.•• then the daily energy of the next day is 8.46487E+006. 
As can be seen, there was no difference whether the day was 
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. When a 
least minimum squared was intended, none of the statistical 
tests was satisfactory; therefore more explanatory variables 
were used to improve the model adjustment. For this purpose 
binary variables or dunnnies were manipulated to represent 
the day of the week because it was known that this variable is 
relevant for the load forecasting. In this case there was better 
adjustment making these distinctions although it incurred in a 
greater division of the input space. 
For example node 23 changes from 1 to 4 rules, as follows: 
» Node 23 a: if the day of the week is Monday and the average speed of 
the winds of the current day is more than 3.75 and ...... . 
» Node 23 b: if the day of the week is Tuesday and .... . 
» Node 23 c: if the day of the week is Wednesday and ... . 
» Node 23 d: if the day of the week is Friday and the average speed of 
the winds of the current day is more than 3.75 and ..... . 
In total there were about 350 tests made to find 87 functions 
for the consequents of the TS rules. 
3) Part c: Implementation of the Fuzzy Inference System 
Once the Takagi - Sugeno rules and the number of 
membership functions were obtained the following step was 
the implementation of the FIS. To create the fuzzy inference 
system the "fuzzy" function of the Fuzzy Logic toolbox in 
MATLAB 6.1 was used. 
The system has in total 25 inputs, for the 7 days of the week, 
the three day types (labour, holiday or weekend), and the 15 
meteorological variables. Since the day of the week and the 
type of day are concrete values the membership function that 
better fits is the singleton, not yet implemented in the 
toolbox, therefore a very narrow triangular function was used. 
Bell functions were used to implement meteorological 
variables and function parameters were estimated using least 
minimum squared estimators. With the two FIS, for peak 
power and energy, the forecast of these variables was made. 
D. STAGE III: Integration of the fuzzy clustering and FIS 
In Stage I, with the use of LAMDA meteorologically similar 
days are found and in Stage II forecasts for peak power and 
daily energy peak are made. Now the user will have to 
choose which the most similar day in history is and make the 
growth adjustments to be able to forecast the load curve of 
the day to forecast following the flux diagram in Figure 3.

TEST CASE: SIMILAR DAYS

Table I shows the result of the meteorologically most similar 
days to a test day, on this case Wednesday October 18 of 
2000. It was found according to the GAD of the data in the 
class that the most similar days are: Friday August 3 of 2000, 
Friday May 5 of 2000, Tuesday November 23 of 1998 and 
Thursday October 14 of 1998 . . We observe that the standard 
deviation in most of the variables for the similar days is low. 
Figure 4 shows one variable of those with which the search of 
the similar day was made. As it can be seen these variables 
are quantitatively very near. Figure 5 shows the load curves 
of the similar days obtained based only on the meteorological 
variables. These load curves are similar evidencing that the 
meteorological variables have explanation power for the 
electric power consumption.

Once the similar days were identified the meteorological 
data, the day type and the day of the week were entered to the 
fuzzy inference system for the short term load forecast. 
Table II shows the result when the Takagi - Sugeno rules 
consequent of first order were used. 
However there is still error due to the small database, since it 
has not been possible to characterize all the different types of 
days. One can observe that the days December 25 are non­
typical days that could not be well characterized as 
consequence of few learning data.

Fig.5. Load curves of the meteorologically similar days to Noy/ 8/2000. 
Later, to find the demand curve, the most similar day is 
chosen between the similar days found by fuzzy clustering, 
for this it should be kept in mind the day of the week, the day 
type and the calendar date, for example, if it is Christmas day, 
it has priority a similar day of one earlier Christmas that other 
days of the year. 
Making the forecast of load curve for example for Thursday 
November 24 of 2000, the most similar days found were: 
Tuesday June 2 of 1998, Friday June 5 of 1998, Thursday 
July 9 of 1998, Tuesday July 27 of 1999 and Wednesday 
November 10 of 1999. Having as a priority the similarity of 
the day of the week, it is chosen as similar day the day 
Thursday July 9 of 1998, load data can be seen in Table III. 
Keeping in mind the criteria of moving up the curve to the 
peak power, without passing above 3% of the daily energy 
forecasted, the curve goes up in a delta calculated as follows: 
,1 = Ppeak forecasted - Ppeak of similar day 
2 
The result of the adjusted curve is shown in Figure 6. For 
this day it can be observed that the error in the peak power 
forecast was 0.55% and in the energy demand was 2.74%. 
When the similar day approach is used for the demand curve 
forecast it has an error of 2.96% on average, and the form of 
the curve is similar.

IV. CONCLUSIONS 
A novel method is shown to make short tenn demand forecast 
using the bases of fuzzy logic and statistical methods. This 
method allows making the forecast of the whole demand 
curve contrary to others in which the curve is forecasted by 
means of an hourly forecast. 
CART classification and regression trees allow identifying 
the relevant variables for STLF without using autoregressive 
models in the load. In the test case, the variables used were 
temperature, relative humidity and speed of the winds. 
Based on data analysis support rules can be generated for the 
expert that show the reasoning line followed by the model. Is 
a tool for peak power and daily energy forecast integrated to 
the similar day approach through the fuzzy inference system. 
The model developed can be applied to any dynamic mime 
system in which forecast is necessary to be made. However, 
a limitation of the proposed method is the propagation of 
error because a high degree of meteorological forecast is 
needed.
