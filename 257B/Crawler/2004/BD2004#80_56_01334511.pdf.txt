Abstract
The automatic color grading of ceramic tiles is still a 
big challenge, which needs more researching work. The 
classifying methods based on color means or histograms 
can’t meet current factory requests, because in modern 
building, various types and color patterns have been 
applied to floor & wall ceramic tiles. In this paper, a new 
method has been proposed to tackle the question that is 
wavelet texture analysis combined with color information. 
The selection of wavelet has been discussed, as well as the 
extraction and optimization of feature set based on 
wavelet decomposition of samples’ color images. Knn 
classifier and the error rate have been used to evaluate 
classifying performance, and FFFS (Floating Forward 
Feature Selection) method has been applied to 
feature-sets’ sub-optimization. The experimental results 
have shown that the sub-optimal wavelet textural features 
combined with color information well described the 
samples’ clustering based on color, texture and resolution, 
and the classifying results have taken on very good 
agreement with experts’. The experiments also have 
shown the feature optimization greatly decreased feature 
vectors’ dimensionality, and consequently decreased 
computational complexity. 
1. Introduction 
In ceramic tiles industry, the automation of visual 
inspection is still a difficult work because of the 
complexity of human visual perception. Nowadays, there 
are some published research [1,2,3,4] on the final 
inspection at which stage the major job include the 
grading tiles into distinct color categories or the rejection 
of tiles with defects and pattern faults, and some methods 
have been developed for color grading. For example, C.
Boukouvalas etc. used the average either of all pixels of 
the tile for the grading of uniformly colored tiles [1], or 
the average of each chromatic category of the tile 
separately for the grading of two-colored tiles with 
well-defined large-scale pattern [2], and the color 
histogram [3,4] is considered the main method to deal 
with multi-colored randomly textured tiles.  
Both methods are challenged when more colors and 
more complex patterns appearing on modern tiles’ surface. 
The fatal limitation of color histogram is that it can’t 
describe the spatial distribution of colors although with 
advantage of being invariant to translation and rotation, 
that means two tiles with different color distribution may 
be mistakenly graded to the same category when their 
histograms are similar but appearances maybe are 
different. So currently how to effectively conduct the 
color grading of multi-colored randomly textured tiles still 
need further efforts. In this paper, a new method based on 
wavelet analysis of color image is introduced. 
We have learnt the visual perception of a colored tile is 
a combination of color, texture and scale (or the distance 
between the tile and human’s eye). The change of scales 
will lead to change of textural appearance, as well as 
change of color perception. According to this, wavelet 
texture analysis is an effective tool because of good 
localization both in spatial region and frequency region. G. 
Van de Wouwer [5] made great efforts to add color 
information to wavelet texture analysis of gray images, 
namely the wavelet texture analysis of color images. It is 
a good method to combine information of color, texture 
and scales into a compound set of features. The 
experimental result shown it is feasible and effective 
when color grading multi-colored randomly textured tiles. 
2. Wavelet Texture Analysis of Color Images
Mallat first proposed the term of multi-resolution 
analysis (or approximation) [6]. In his famous paper [6], 
He constructed the uniform framework of orthogonal 
wavelet base, and with the framework the multi-resolution 
representation of image decomposition was given, that 
makes it quick and easy to wavelet transform and reverse 
transform, which is called Mallat algorithm.  Based on 
those works, Wouwer suggested the method to extend 
wavelet decomposition algorithms from gray image to 
color image, and the method to extract textural features 
[5].

The textural characteristics can be measured from the 
wavelet representation of image of which energy is the 
most important one. Usually energies of the detail 
sub-images are used as textural features because they are 
the high frequency part of origin image and include the 
primary textural information. Energy of the 
sub-image niD  is defined as  ( ) 22)( RbbdbDE nini ∈= ³ GGG                  (4) 
The wavelet energy signatures { }

compose a textural feature set of given image with 
wavelet decomposition of d depth, which reflect the 
distribution of energy along the frequency axis over scale 
and orientation and have proven to be very useful for 
gray-level texture characterization [5].  
2.2. Extension to Color Image 
The most straightforward extension of the wavelet 
energy signatures to color images is to transform each 
color plane separately and compute the energies of each 
transformed plane, i.e. replace I by the R, G, and B-plane 
(when deal with RGB color images) consecutively in 
equation (3) and (4), and we denote such an energy by 
jX
niE  where the jX  indicates the color plane (for 
example, { }
3,2,1=jj
X  represent R, G, and B plane 
respectively in RGB color image case).    
Usually the three planes of color images aren’t 
independent, so the wavelet coefficients between different 
color planes exist correlation. Wouwer define

 the wavelet

covariance signatures include the energies and the others 
represent the covariance between different color planes 
and consequently reflect the coupling between the color 
and texture properties of the image. 
3. Wavelet Selection 
With the development of wavelet analysis in recent 
years, a variety of wavelets of different properties have 
been constructed. Consequently in application a selection 
must be conducted to make features more efficient with 
suitable wavelet. In automation of tiles’ inspection, the 
computational complexity is a key factor, so the first 
consideration is the selected wavelet must be able to apply 
Mallat algorithm. Nowadays there are several families of 
wavelet meeting this request such as Daubechies compact 
support wavlets, Coifman wavelets, biorthogonal spline 
wavelets and reverse biorthogonal spline wavelets etc. In 
this paper, we discussed the selection of suitable wavelet 
through classification performance comparison of 60 
multicolored tiles which have been color graded as 6 
categories by professional inspector.  
Through following schemes, we conduct performance 
comparison: 
(1) Samples. In this paper, test samples are necessary 
to evaluate performance of classification. To improve 
classification performance of limited samples, we 
construct test samples by leave-one-out method that is to 
take one out of the whole samples as test sample and the 
others as design samples.  
(2) Classifier design. We choose Knn classifier with 
k=3, because it is simple, effective and robust. 
(3) Feature extraction. More than twenty wavelets all 
of which support Mallat algorithm have been chosen to 
conduct decomposition on the sample tiles’ color images 
and their wavelet covariance signatures have been 
extracted as feature sets.   
(4) Performance evaluation. In this paper, we take error 
rate as error estimation, and define it as

We come to the conclusion that the classifying 
performance is much better when selecting biorthogonal 
spline wavelet of 2 orders. Also the table shown that the 
performance didn’t go up with the wavelet decomposition 
depth. The phenomenon may be explained with 
resolutions (or scales) of images. In wavelet 
representation, the detail sub-images of different 
resolution describe the different physical construction of 
image, at lower resolution, which represent bigger 
physical construction and reflect the outline information 
of image. As we known, the wavelet decomposition 
conduct through high resolution to low resolution, that is 
more decomposition depth, more outline information will 
be included in feature set. In tiles’ color grading, the 
outlines between tiles are very similar, so the 
superabundance of outline information make classifying 
performance worse. 
4. Optimization of Feature Set 
We have learnt the fact that classification performance 
does not always ascend with growth of feature set 
dimensionality that also has been verified by our 
foregoing experimental result in above section. 
Accordingly it’s reasonable to conduct dimensionality 
reduction and feature selection in terms either of 
computational complexity or of classification 
performance [7]. For example, the feature set is of 36 
dimensions after conducting wavelet decomposition of 2 
depths on color image and extracting the wavelet 
covariance signatures as features, but not every one of 
which is good and efficient for classification. The 
optimization of feature set aims to search those features 
the most representational and the most efficient. In this 
question we must decide how many features and which 
features come to the best classification performance under 
given criteria. One answer to this question is full 
searching that is performance comparison of all possible 
feature combinations, but it is usually big time consuming 
despite good performance. So in practice, suboptimal 
methods are used to replace it. There are many alternative 
suboptimal methods, among which the FFFS (Floating 
Forward Feature Selection) is verified the best [8]. 
Based on the experiment in section 3, we select 
biorthogonal spline wavelet of 2 orders and conduct 
wavelet decomposition of 2 depths on color images of the 
same 60 tiles and extract the wavelet covariance 
signatures (of 36 dimensions) as their raw feature sets. 
Then optimize the raw sets by FFFS algorithm [9] with 
Knn as classifier and error rate as cost function. The 
experimental results have shown in figure 1.

feature set, and the ordinate indicates corresponding 
classifying performance (here namely correct rate eˆ1− ).
Figure 1 shown that when the dimensionality of 
selected feature set is 3, the classification performance is 
up to saturation of correct rate 98.33% then hold on until 
the dimensionality is 31 at which point the classification 
performance begin to descend that means some bad 
features have been added. 
From experimental data, when the dimensionality is 3, 
the optimal features combination is: the energy of 
horizontal detail sub-image of 1 depth decomposition on 
red color plane, the energy of horizontal detail sub-image 
of 1 depth decomposition on blue color plane, and the 
covariance signature between horizontal detail sub-images 
of 2 depth decomposition on red color plan and blue plane 
respectively. Additionally all the bad features of more 
than 31 dimensions are almost the energies of green color 
plane or covariance signatures between green color plane 
and the other two planes. By observation on sample tiles 
(see figure 2, two tiles of different color grading are taken 
as example), we found that all tiles have the similar 
pattern of alternate with red and blue color on white 
background, but the spatial distribution of red and blue 
color is different that discriminate tiles of one color grade 
from those of another color grade.

4. Conclusion 
Human’s visual perception on colored tiles is a 
complex combination included colors, brightness and the 
spatial distribution (or texture) and even psychological 
factors. In addition, the textural perception will vary with 
distance between the tiles and human eyes that mean the 
resolution (or scale) must be taken into consideration. In 
the view of this point, wavelet texture analysis combined 
with color information should be an effective tool.  
In this paper, the experimental results shown the 
wavelet representation of color image effectively describe 
the spatial distribution of colors and textural information 
over scale and direction, and the optimization of feature 
set not only drastically reduce feature set dimensionality 
(from 36 to 3) consequently greatly decreased 
computational complexity, but also improve classifying 
performance (from correct rate 96.7% to 98.33). 
To summary it up, we come to the conclusions: first, 
the wavelet representation of colored image is a powerful 
tool for color grading of multi-colored randomly textural 
ceramic tiles; second, to effectively applied the tool, the 
wavelet selection and feature optimization must be 
conducted.
