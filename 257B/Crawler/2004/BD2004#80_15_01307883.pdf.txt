EXTENDED ABSTRACT: 
This paper addresses the problem of taking into account the data imprecision in the clustering of 
binned data using mixture models and binned EM algorithm [ 13. Within the framework of a defects 
detection problem by acoustic emission control, we were brought to treat a set of points using the 
EM algorithm [2,3] applied to a diagonal Gaussian mixture model [4]. This one provides a 
satisfactory solution but the real time constraints imposed in our problem make its application 
impossible when the number of points becomes too big. As data sets become larger, data processing 
becomes increasingly complex and as a result, the data analysis will be expensive in computation 
time. The solution that we propose is to group data and available data will thus takes the form of a 
histogram. Such data are also called binned data. Binning data is common in data analysis and 
machine learning. An EM approach to solve this problem was already proposed [5] in dimension 1 
and was then generalized to the multidimensional case [ l ]  to deal with binned data. This EM 
approach rcquircs the cvaluation of rnultidimcnsional intcgrals ovcr cach bin at cach itcration. 
Naive implementation of the procedure can lead to computationally inefficient results. To reduce 
the computational cost, a number of straightforward numerical techniques are proposed in [l]. In 
the diagonal Gaussian mixture model [4] case, these integrals can be computed by simply using the 
one-dimensional normal cumulative distribution function. In this paper, we fit the binning data 
procedure to imprecise data. We model imprecise data by multivariate uncertainty zones and we 
propose to assign each uncertainty zone to several bins with percentages proportional to its 
overlapping surfaces with the bins. The experimental results compare this binning procedure with 
the classical one (applied to imprecise points) and with the interval EM algorithm [6]  considered 
here as a reference, using simulated data.
