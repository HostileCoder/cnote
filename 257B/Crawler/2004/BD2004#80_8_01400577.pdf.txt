Abstract— To safely transfer a broadcast packet to all nodes
in computer networks is an important issue. However, it is a big
challenge to transfer broadcast packets over wireless networks
reliably due to the unsettled wireless links and lack of the
acknowledgment (ACK) scheme. Therefore, in this paper, we
proposed a reliable broadcast scheme named broadcast engage-
ment ACK mechanism (BEAM), which is completely compatible
with the IEEE 802.11 protocol, in the data link layer rather
than the network layer. This is because that the overhead of
raising the reliability of broadcast transmission in network layer
would be significantly reduced in data link layer. Simulation
results show that the proposed BEAM can reach approximate
100% reliability even in heavy traffic load. Besides, by using the
proposed mechanism, the IEEE 802.11 protocol could provide
the reliability of unicast transmissions as well as broadcast
transmissions and avoid redundant control overhead.
I. INTRODUCTION
A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is constructed by
several mobile handsets or laptops, which is used on-demand,
and needs dynamic routing protocols when there is a packet
needed to be transferred more than one hop. In point-to-point
communication networks a large number of broadcast-routing
protocols have been proposed [4], [7]. The mobile node usually
broadcasts a route request (RREQ) packet that is flooded
through the network in a controlled manner to perform route
discovery and is replied by unicasting a route reply (RREP)
packet from either the destination node or intermediate nodes
that have a route to the destination. However, unlike wired
networks to which broadcast packets can be easily and safely
delivered, it is a big challenge to transfer broadcast packets
over MANETs due to the uncertain of the reception of
broadcast transmissions and the unsettled wireless links.
Flooding packets to all nodes in networks could be achieved
by using multiple unicast transmissions in network layer or
using broadcast transmissions in data link layer. The former
solution, however, would cause many control overheads and
degrade the performance of MANETs since too many dupli-
cated packet transmissions are performed in one broadcast
transmission [12]. These solutions have been investigated and
discussed in many literatures [1], [3], [5], [12].
In [1], Algar and Venkatesan proposed a reliable broadcast
protocol, named as AVR, based on replying acknowledgment
(ACK) packets back to the sender. The basic idea of AVR is the
provision for each mobile node to retain a so called history
of messages broadcast to and received from its neighbor(s).
A node which receives a broadcast packet replies an ACK
to the sender via unicasting and updates its local history. If
a sending node does not receive an ACK from a neighbor
within a certain time, it timeouts and resends the packet. If a
sender does not receive an ACK after several retries, it assumes
the link disconnection is not transient and stops sending
the message. Obviously the exchange of local information
and redundant broadcast retransmission would lead to the
broadcast storm problem [12] and degrade the performance
of networks. Besides, the requirement of sending ACKs in
response to the receipt of a packet for all receivers may cause
channel congestion and packet collisions, which is called ACK
implosion [3]. The ACK implosion problem may worsen the
broadcast storm problem [12].
In order to alleviate the broadcast storm problem, Lou and
Wu proposed a broadcast with selected acknowledgements
(BSA) [5] protocol for reliable broadcast transmission in
MANETs. When a node broadcasts a packet, it selects a subset
of one-hop neighbors as its forwarding nodes to forward the
broadcast based on a greedy manner. The selection scheme of
forwarding nodes is based on neighbor-designating algorithm
[6], [8]. Although the BSA can reduce the ACK implosion
phenomenon, finding the forwarding nodes in a given graph is
the NP-complete problem [6]. This drawback would consume
the limited battery power of mobile nodes rapidly.
The wastage of redundant transmissions of a broadcast
packet could be solved in data link layer since the broadcast
frame is transmitted once by using broadcast identification.
However, many medium access control (MAC) protocols such
as IEEE 802.11 [2] adopt blind broadcasting mechanism to
transmit broadcast frames and leads to unreliable broadcast
problem due to the lack of ACK1 scheme. The uncertain
broadcast problem might not satisfy the requirement of reliable
broadcast transmissions of higher layers.
In order to solve this problem, a reliable MAC broadcast
scheme named broadcast medium window (BMW) protocol
is introduced in [9], [10]. The basic idea of the BMW

is provided in data link layer.

protocol is that it treats each broadcast request as multiple
unicast requests. Each node maintains three lists: its neighbors,
sending buffer, and receiving buffer. In BMW, when a node has
a broadcast data to send, the sender places the packet into its
sending buffer and sends out an request-to-send (RTS) control
frame containing the sequence number of the upcoming data
frame and the MAC address of the first node in its neighbor
list. When a node receives a RTS containing its MAC address,
it will check the list of its receiving buffer to see whether it has
received all the data frames with sequence number smaller than
or equal to the upcoming one. If all the data frames (including
the upcoming one) have been received, the receiver sends a
clear-to-send (CTS) with appropriate information to suppress
the sender’s data frame transmission. Otherwise, the receiver
sends a CTS frame with all the missing data frame sequence
numbers. This process would be terminated when all nodes in
the neighbor list have been served.
Unfortunately, the BMW is inefficient since it requires at
least n contention phases for each broadcast data frame where
n is the number of neighbors. Not only is each contention
phase lengthy time, but also the sender has to contend for the
right of access to the medium with other nodes. It is possible
that some other nodes win the contention and thereby inter-
rupts and prolongs the ongoing broadcast process. Besides, the
BMW also has a lot of overhead and does not guarantee the
reliability of the transmission immediately, and needs to cost
a maintenance of three lists. According to these drawbacks,
we proposed an efficient reliable broadcast scheme named
broadcast engagement ACK mechanism (BEAM), which is
operated in data link layer and is compatible with the IEEE
802.11 MAC protocol.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Sec-
tion II introduces the operations of proposed BEAM and
illustrates the frame format of the BEAM in detail. The
simulation models and results are given in Section III. Finally,
we will give some conclusions in Section IV.
II. THE BROADCAST ENGAGEMENT ACK MECHANISM
The reliability of broadcast transmission could be improved
by adopting the acknowledgment scheme [11] (the ACK
frame used in data transmission). We use the subfields Type
(=10) and Subtype (=1000), which is a reserved number in
the IEEE 802.11 protocol [2], of the frame control field of
MAC header to indicate a specific broadcast frame that would
receive broadcast ACK (denoted as BACK for short) frames
from its neighbors. The frame format is shown in Fig. 1.
However, requiring all nodes which have successfully received
the broadcast frames to reply a BACK would be a problem
since these nodes will reply their BACKs at the same time
and collide with each other. In order to solve the troublesome
problem, we use an additional field named BACK Order,
which is an MAC header extension, to request all receiving
nodes to reply their BACKs in specified order. The length of
BACK Order field is determined by its neighbors, which can
be easily obtained by persistently monitoring the transmission
activities around its transmission range, e.g., using a neighbor

table to record the transmitter address (TA) of each data frame
and maintain for a period. The record would be removed from
the table when there are no transmissions of the node after a
specific time period. Since the number of neighbors varies by
time, we use a subfield Number of BACKs shown in Fig. 1 to
indicate how many nodes n should respond to the broadcast
frame. This subfield’s length is 2 octets long (for supporting
maximum 216 = 65,536 neighbors).
After receiving the broadcast frame, nodes which are spec-
ified in the BACK Order would reply BACKs one by one
according to the order of the list indicated in the frame
body. Thus the sender node could uses the conditions of
acknowledgment to confirm the reception of each node. The
broadcast frame will be retransmitted immediately after doing
not receive a BACK frame within an idle slot time (e.g.,
20µs in direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) system). This
process would be terminated after receiving all BACKs of its
recorded neighbors. However, the sender may not receive all its
neighbors’ BACKs due to the mobility or the communication
interference. This problem could be solved by adopting the
limitation of maximum time of broadcast retransmission.
The duration of broadcast transmission includes the broad-
cast data frame transmitting time plus n × (SIFS + ACK)
in normal condition. The duration will be extended if a
corrupted data frame or missing a BACK frame occurs. We use
the network allocation vector (NAV), named broadcast NAV
(BNAV), recorded in the duration field of the MAC header in
each broadcast data frame and BACK frame to indicate the
duration of the broadcast transmission. The duration will be
recalculated if a broadcast retransmission is performed. We
note that the duration of new recalculated BNAV denoted as
extended BNAV equals the length of original duration except
the portion of having been replied BACKs. We also note that
the duration field of BACKs records the remaining BNAV in
its duration field to restrain the hidden nodes’ transmissions.
Fig. 2 illustrates an example of the proposed BEAM. The
network topology shown in left side consists of a sender,
four receivers, and four hidden terminals. The duration of
original broadcast data frame equals the data frame length
plus four SIFSs and BACKs. Assume node 1 receives the

to sender s successfully but node 2 does not receive the
broadcast frame (interrupted by node 6) and does not reply
a BACK. After one idle slot, node s rebroadcasts the data
frame and recalculates the new duration of retransmission as
extended BNAV. The length of extended BNAV is the data
frame length plus the remaining three BACKs. Finally all
remaining nodes receive the broadcast data and reply their
BACKs accordingly. The broadcast transmission algorithm is
shown in Fig. 3 where nBACK represents the number of
BACKs. Besides, the algorithms of transmission and reception
are given in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, respectively.
III. SIMULATION MODELS AND RESULTS
In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed
BEAM, two kinds of simulation models are designed to
observe the broadcast fraction and broadcast delivery ratio.
Simulation parameters follow the IEEE 802.11b Standard and
are listed in Table I. In our simulation models, direct sequence

convergence protocol (PLCP), and PLCP protocol data unit
(PPDU) format are used. The background data packets arrival
rate of each mobile node follows the Poisson distribution. The
broadcast request arrival rate of each mobile node also follows
the Poisson distribution, and the broadcast frame length is a
fixed length of 25 octets. Each simulation run lasts 60 seconds
and each simulation result is obtained by averaging the results
from twenty independent simulation runs.

broadcast transmissions and the data arrival rate of each hidden
terminal is 10 packets/second. The unicast data arrival rate of
each node (consider as background traffic) is 2 packets/second,
and the broadcast arrival rate of each node is considered from
0.5 packets/second to 2.5 packets/second.
Fig. 6 shows the broadcast fractions by the pure IEEE
802.11 broadcast scheme and BEAM under different offered
load. This offered load is calculated by data packet arrival
rate of hidden terminals and background traffic and broadcast
requests of full connected nodes. We can see that the broadcast
fraction of the IEEE 802.11 lowers from 70% to 27% gradually
due to the interference of hidden terminals. However, the
proposed BEAM uses the BACKs scheme to prevent hidden
node phenomenon and reaches approximate 100% reliability
even in heavy traffic load.
Afterward we run the simulation in the multihop ad hoc
environment. The working space is enlarged to 600 m × 600
m with a transmission radius of 120 m. Different numbers of
nodes (range from 20 to 100) are randomly placed in this area.
Excepting the first mobile node, the other mobile nodes will be
reallocated until it has at least one neighbor. This ensures the
simulated network topology is a connected graph. The unicast
data arrival rate of each mobile node is 1 packets/second, and
the data arrival rate of broadcast request in each mobile node
is considered as 2 packets/second.
We compare the performance of our proposed BEAM with
the following schemes:
• Blood flooding (BF): each node forwards the packet when
it receives the packet.
• AV Reliable broadcast (AVR) [1].
• Broadcast with selected acknowledgements (BSA) [5].
Two important performance metrics are investigated:
• Broadcast delivery ratio: The ratio of the nodes that re-
ceived the broadcast packet to the number of the network.
• Broadcast forwarding ratio: The fraction of the total
number of nodes in the network that retransmit the
broadcast packet at least once.
Fig. 7, Fig. 8, and Fig. 9 show the broadcast delivery ratio

of BEAM, blind flooding (BF), AVR, and BSA in different
retry counts. BF can’t guarantee the data transmits correctly
due to it lacks the ACK mechanism. Therefore, the delivery
ratio of BF is not good. Besides, BEAM, AVR, and BSA have
ACK mechanism, along with the retry increase, the broadcast
packet may a more widespread dissemination. If broadcast,
each receivers must sends ACKs to source in AVR. But in
BSA, only selected forward node sends ACKs to source and
broadcast, the delivery ratio of AVR is obvious lower than
BSA. Regardless of in which environments, BSA use fewer
nodes to broadcast the message, but its delivery ratio is not
excellent. Due to our scheme to use schedule method to send
ACKs and to avoid other nodes influence the broadcast. We
can see our proposed scheme have highly delivery ratio.
In Fig. 10, the BSA only selects some forward node to
reply ACKs and broadcast it, so his forwarding ratio lower
than AVR and the BEAM. However, the BSA is a network
layer approach and could combine our BEAM for further
enhancement. Fig. 11 and Fig. 12 show that the combination
of BSA and BEAM have low broadcast forwarding ratio and
highly broadcast delivery ratio. The result indicates that the
BEAM can achieve higher reliability broadcast transmissions.

IV. CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we proposed a reliable broadcast transmission
scheme named broadcast engagement acknowledgment mech-
anism (BEAM) for broadcast transmission in ad hoc networks.
The proposed BEAM not only achieved high flooding delivery
ratio but was fully compatible with the IEEE 802.11 MAC
protocol. The BEAM enhanced the broadcast fraction of IEEE
802.11 to 100% even in heavy traffic load. This was achieved
by enforcing the neighboring nodes to confirm their receipt
of the broadcast frame accordingly. Besides, the BEAM was
the data link layer protocol rather than the network layer
protocol and thus reduced a lot of control overheads in
achieving reliability. Simulation results showed that the BEAM
approaches higher broadcast delivery ratio as well as reduces
bandwidth consumption efficiently.
