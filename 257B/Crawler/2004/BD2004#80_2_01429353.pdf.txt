Comparison of Market Parameters for Jump-Diﬀusion
Distributions Using Multinomial Maximum Likelihood Estimation
Floyd B. Hanson and Zongwu Zhu
Abstract—Previously, we have shown that the proper
method for estimating parameters from discrete, binned stock
log returns is the multinomial maximum likelihood estimation,
and its performance is superior to the method of least squares.
Useful formulas have been derived for the jump-diﬀusion
distributions. Numerically, the parameter estimation can be a
large scale nonlinear optimization, but we have used techniques
to reduce the computation demands of multi-dimensional
direct search. In this paper, three jump-diﬀusion models
using diﬀerent jump-amplitude distributions are compared.
These are the normal, uniform and double-exponential. The
parameters of all three models are ﬁt to the Standard and
Poor’s 500 log-return market data, constrained by the data
ﬁrst and second moments. While the results for the skew and
kurtosis moments are mixed, the uniform jump distribution
has superior qualitative performance since it produces genuine
fat tails that are typical of market data, whereas the others
have exponentially thin tails. However, the log-normal model
has a big advantage in computational time of parameter esti-
mation compared with the others, while the double-exponential
is most costly due to having one more model parameter.
I. Introduction
Despite the great success of Black-Scholes model [2] in
option pricing, this pure log-normal diﬀusion model fails
to reﬂect the three empirical phenomena: (1) the large
random ﬂuctuations such as crashes and rallies; (2) the non-
normal features, that is, negative skewness and leptokurtic
(peakedness) behavior in the stock log-return distribution;
(3) the implied volatility smile, that is, the implied volatility
is not a constant as in the Black-Scholes model.
Therefore, many diﬀerent models are proposed to modify
the Black-Scholes model so as to represent the above three
empirical phenomena. Merton [9] introduced the jump-
diﬀusion model in ﬁnancial modeling, using a Poisson
process for the jump timing and a log-normal process for the
jump-amplitudes to describe the market crashes and rallies.
Some models are proposed to incorporate the volatility
smile, for example, Andersen, Benzoni and Lund [1] have
made elaborate estimations to ﬁt jump-diﬀusion models
with log-normal jump-amplitudes, stochastic volatility and
other features. Some models are proposed to incorporate the
asymmetric features of the stock log-return distributions.
Recently, Kou [8] proposed a jump-diﬀusion model with
a log-double-exponential process for the jump-amplitudes.
Since crashes and rallies are rare events, so the Poisson

process is reasonable for the timing of jumps. However,
there is a problem in choosing the log-normal or log-
double-exponential process for the jump-amplitudes since
the exponentially small tails of the log-normal and log-
double-exponential distributions are contrary to the ﬂat and
thick tails of the long time ﬁnancial market log-return data.
Around the near-zero peak of the log-double-exponential
and the log-normal, the jumps are small, so are not quali-
tatively diﬀerent from the continuous diﬀusion ﬂuctuations.
Moreover, an inﬁnite jump domain is unrealistic, since the
jumps should be bounded in a real world ﬁnancial markets
and an inﬁnite domain leads to unrealistic restrictions in
portfolio optimization [5].
So, Hanson and Westman [4] proposed one jump-
diﬀusion model with log-uniform jump-amplitude. Most
recently, Hanson, Westman and Zhu [7] showed that for
IID simulations the binned distribution is multinomial. They
estimated the market parameters for this log-uniform model
by subsequent multinomial maximum likelihood method to
ﬁt ﬁnancial market distributions such as the Standard and
Poor’s 500 stock index.
The main purpose of this paper is to compare the
performance of three jump-diﬀusion models whose jump-
amplitudes are the log-normally, log-uniformly and log-
double-exponentially distributed.
II. Some Theoretical Results
A. Stock Return Process, S(t)
The following stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE) is
used to model the dynamics of the asset price, S(t):
dS(t) = S(t) (µddt + σddW (t) + J(Q)dP (t)) , (II.1)
where µd is the drift coeﬃcient, σd is the diﬀusive volatility,
W (t) is the stochastic diﬀusion process, J(Q) is the Poisson
jump-amplitude, Q is its underlying Poisson amplitude
mark process, J(Q)dP (t) is just a symbol for the countingPdP (t)
i=1 J(Qi), P (t) is the standard Poisson jump process
with joint mean and variance E[P (t)] = λt = Var[P (t)].
B. Stock Log-Return Process, ln(S(t))
The stock log-return ln(S(t)) can be transformed to
a simpler jump-diﬀusion stochastic diﬀerential equation
(SDE) upon the use of the stochastic chain rule [6],
d[ln(S(t))] = µlddt + σddW (t) + QdP (t), (II.2)
where µld ≡ µd − 0.5σ2d is the log-diﬀusive (ld) drift and
for simplicity the log-jump-amplitude is taken as the mark
Q = ln(J(Q) + 1).

C. Log-Normal Jump Distribution
Let the density of the jump-amplitude mark Q be normal
φQ(q) = φn(q;µj , σ
2
j ), (II.3)
where φn(q;µj , σ
2
j ) is the normal density with mean µj
and variance σ2j . The log-normal jump-amplitude jump-
diﬀusion model was used in [9], [1], [3] and others.
For the density for this jump-diﬀusion model with log-
normal jump-amplitude, Hanson and Westman [3] proved,
with corrections given here in terms of the distribution
truncated to the second order approximation in terms of
the Poisson distribution, the following corollary:
Corollary: The second order approximation to [x1, x2]

amplitude is given by

p
σ2d∆t, pk(Λ) =
e−ΛΛk/k! is the Poisson distribution with parameter Λ =
λ∆t and k jumps and ∆t is the corresponding trading time
increment in years.
This corollary is based upon the law of total probability
[6, Chapter 0] resulting in the sum over all k Poisson
jumps, the convolution theorem [6] yielding the density of
the log-jump-diﬀusion conditioned on there being k IID
jumps, and the fact that the convolution of two normals
is also normal [6]. For the purpose of comparison, we
use two terms of the expansion to provide more accurate
estimations since we are dealing with small but moderately
small time steps. The additional contribution of the third
order approximation is only 1.5% whereas the 2nd order
approximation contributed 23% to the 1st. Note that an
appropriate 2nd order renormalization is used to preserve
the distribution property.

D. Log-Uniform Jump Distribution
Let the density of the jump-amplitude mark Q be uni-
form
φQ(q) =

b− a , (II.5)
where a < 0 < b and H(x) is the Heaviside unit step
function. The mark Q has moments, µj ≡ E[Q] = 0.5(b+a),
σ2j ≡ Var[Q] = (b − a)2/12. The original jump-amplitude J
has mean E[J(Q)] = (exp(b)− exp(a))/(b− a)− 1.
For the distribution of the jump-diﬀusion model with log-
uniform jump-amplitude, the following corollary follows
from the density in [6, Chapter 5],

For the distribution (II.6), the ﬁrst and second order term
formulas, Φ

ujd(x1, x2) for i = 1 : 2, have been reduced by
integration by parts to single normal distribution integrals to
minimize the computational costs, making it comparable for
the normal jump case in (II.4). Also, the terms are arranged
to minimize the eﬀects of catastrophic cancellation.

skewness and kurtosis coeﬃcient for these three models to
suﬃcient accuracy for a satisfactory comparison.

Sometimes, the kurtosis is represented as the excess kurtosis
coeﬃcient by subtracting three from the kurtosis coeﬃcient
so that the excess is zero for the normal distribution.
III. Parameter Estimations
The basic point of view, here, is that the ﬁnancial markets
are considered to be a moderate size simulation of one of
these three jump-diﬀusion processes.
A. Empirical Data
We use Standard and Poor’s 500 (S&P500) stock index
in the decade 1992-2001 [12] as the sample of the ﬁnancial
market since it is in general viewed as one big mutual fund
so that it is less dependent on the peculiar behavior of any
one stock. Let n(sp) = 2522 be the number of daily closings

B. Multinomial Maximum Likelihood Estimation
In a previous paper [7], the multinomial maximum likeli-
hood estimation of model parameters is justiﬁed for binned
ﬁnancial data, but applies to very general binned data. The
main idea for this method is the following:
• Step 1: Sort the sample data into nb bins and get the
sample frequency f
(sp)
b , for b = 1:nb.
• Step 2: Get the theoretical jump-diﬀusion frequency
with parameter vector x:
f
(jd)
b (x) ≡ ns
Z
Bb
φ(jd)(η;x)dη ,
where φ(jd)(η;x) is some jump-diﬀusion density in η
and Bb is the bth bin.
• Step 3: Minimize the objective function:

, (III.2)
where the negative of the likelihood is minimized,
corresponding to the minimizing MATLAB function
fminsearch to get the optimal parameters x∗ for the
three compared models, respectively. This MATLAB
function is an implementation of the Nelder-Mead
down-hill simplex direct search method [11]. The
Nelder-Mead is usually faster than other optimization
methods when it works. Some comparisons with our
multidimensional golden section search method for the
ﬁnancial parameter estimation problem are given in
[7].

C. Jump-Diﬀusion Moment Estimation Constraints
For the jump-diﬀusion model with log-normal and log-
uniform jump-amplitude, there are ﬁve (5) free jump-
diﬀusion parameters: {µld, σ
2
d, µj, σ
2
j , λ}. For the model
with log-double-exponential jump-amplitude, there are six
(6) free jump-diﬀusion parameters: {µld, σ
2
d, µ1, µ2, p1, λ}.
So, to reduce this set to a reasonable number, the multi-
nomial maximum likelihood estimation is subjected to the
mean and variance constraints:
M
(sp)
1 = M
(jd)
1 and M
(sp)
2 = M
(jd)
2 . (III.3)
Two diﬀusion parameters, µld and σd, are eliminated by

subject to positivity constraints with suﬃciently small
ε > 0. Although σ2d normally should be positive, but not
necessarily for the ﬁrst argument of the max in (III.5).
For the log-normal and log-uniform jump-diﬀusion model,
only three free parameters are left: x = {µj , σ2j , λ}. For
the log-double-exponential jump-diﬀusion model, four free
parameters are left: x = {µ1, µ2, p1, λ}with signiﬁcantly
more computational estimation costs and it is subject to
an exponential form of catastrophic cancellation unless the
one-sided exponentials are appropriately collected.
IV. Numerical Results, Figures and Discussion
We use the MATLAB 7.0 [10] to program our codes.
The multinomial maximum likelihood estimation given
here is used to estimate the jump-diﬀusion parameters.
The numerical optimization was performed using the
fminsearch function [10]. For the normal distribution
integrals Φn(x1, x2;µ, σ
2) or Φn(x1;µ, σ
2), the use of the
fast and reliable MATLAB complementary error function
erfc was critical, since more standard integration functions
for unscaled arguments failed small variance σ2 tests due
to poor detection of the main probability mass. For the log-
normal and log-uniform model, the same starting point x0
is used. For the log-double-exponential model, the diﬀerent
starting point x0 is used: initial µ1 and µ2 are from an initial
estimation of the µj and using p1  0.6 > 0.5 and the λ∆t
value are the same as the log-normal or log-uniform.
The empirical data used in the estimation are the S&P500
daily closing log-returns from the decade 1992-2001. This
data is displayed here in Figure 1 with 100 equally spaced
bins. The ragged appearance of the histogram resembles
the random simulation of a density using a moderate, but
inadequate sample size. The crashes are represented by
the extreme negative tails and the rallies by the extreme
positive tails, but these extreme events are diﬃcult to see
since they are rare events with small frequency counts, i.e.,
the extreme tails are sparsely populated, with the extreme
negative events more widely separated than the extreme
positive events. Note that extremeness is measured by the
values of the log-returns on the horizontal axes.
However, if the histogram frequencies are multiplied by
the centered value of the evenly spaced bin log-returns,

slowly with the jump magnitude, especially in the shoulders
of the hysteriagram. The convolution of the diﬀusion with
multiple jump uniform distributions in (II.6) help counter
the normal distribution tendency to having exponential thin

distribution.

Figure 5 shows that the log-double-exponential jump-
amplitude ﬁtted model hysteriagram exhibits too thin tails
that decay too fast with the jump magnitude that is very
similar to the log-normal jump-amplitude model. The con-
volution of normal and exponential distributions in (II.8),
like the normal jump-amplitude model, can only lead to
exponential thin tails.

derived distribution parameters {µd, σd, µj , σj , λ}. Since
the trading days per year are about 250 days, it is not likely
that the jumps rate is more than 100 per year because the
ﬁnance market should be kept stable, so, λ  64 for the
log-uniform is more reasonable. The near-zero peaks of the
normal and double-exponential lead to jump rates that are
double or more than the uniform jump rate. Note that the
jump rate includes all size jumps, including those hidden
under the log-normal diﬀusion. In the table the overall jump
mean µj is given for the purpose of comparison, but for
the double-exponential, the negative jump mean is −µ1 =
-6.88e-3 and the positive jump mean is µ2 = +6.35e-3. For
the double-exponential, the probability of negative jumps is
p1 = 0.504 and that for positive jumps is p2 = 0.496.
The overall jump-diﬀusion parameters {µd, σd, µj , σj , λ}
have somewhat diﬀerent distributions among the three jump
models, with the diﬀusive means and volatilities being the
closest among the parameters. The uniform distribution
gives more weight to the negative jumps with the largest
−µj = 12.18e-4 and largest σj  1.52e-2.

Table II shows the diﬀerences of the variance-normalized
higher moments of skewness β3 and kurtosis β4 between
the estimate value and the observed values. The absolute
skewness diﬀerence is the lowest for the log-uniform jump
model, while the absolute kurtosis diﬀerence is the lowest
3923
for the log-double-exponential jump model.
On the other hand, the skewness diﬀerence is the worst
for the log-normal jump model and the kurtosis diﬀerence
is the worst for the log-uniform jump model, but the log-
normal is only 5% lower than the log-uniform. Of course,
the numerical calculations of the third and fourth moments
are of doubtful computational reliability for data. The ﬁnal
multinomial maximum likelihood values using the negative
of minimum values are essentially the same for all models,
since the same stopping criterion was used.

Table III shows that the log-normal model takes some-
what more iterations and function evaluations than the log-
uniform model does, but the log-normal model parameter
estimate takes about 60% of the time to execute. One reason
is that the log-normal requires only similar normal distri-
bution calculations for each jump count k in (II.4), while
the others require more complex combinations of normal
distributions, powers and exponentials. The extra parameter
needed for the double-exponential means the iteration count,
the function evaluation count and the timings are much
greater. However, the computational eﬀort for both the
uniform and double-exponential models have been greatly
reduced by using integration by parts and more to get single
integrals. If the parameter estimation is done oﬀ-line for an
application instead of on-line then the computational saving
would not be too much of an advantage.

V. Summary and Conclusions
From the above theoretical and data analysis, we can get
the following conclusions:
• The log-uniform model is the qualitatively best overall
among the three models, in terms of genuinely repre-
senting the fat tail property, better approximation to the
empirical skewness and more reasonable jump rates of
real-world market distributions.
• The log-normal model runs faster than the other two
models due to simpler normal bin integrals. On the
other hand, the integration by parts technique has been
used to reduce the computational eﬀort for the log-
uniform and log-double-exponential models. However,
the deﬁciencies of the log-normal model demonstrates
that the distribution that is better analytically is not
necessarily a better model for ﬁnancial markets.
• The results for the log-normal and log-double-
exponential jump amplitude models are qualitatively
similar, having exponentially small tails and near-zero
peaks in the jump distribution making small jumps
more likely.
• However, all three models give reasonable quantitative,
although somewhat mixed, results.
• For the future research and considerations.
1) To improve the log-uniform and other jump mod-
els, the stochastic volatility will be considered
with other factors.
2) To consider the option price and optimal port-
folio applications, approximate solutions to these
problems will be obtained.
