t. INTRODUCTION 
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images taken from 
airborne or space platforms can have high spatial 
resolution, but are affected by the speckle phenomenon 
which makes the extraction of the useful information a 
di fficult task [ I]. 
Segmentation is a low-level description on which image 
understanding is based, It prepares for high level concepts 
such as shape and adjacency. Accurately segmented 
image are easier to interpret, and the performancc of 
objects recognisition is better. 
The gray-level, edge and texture information are the three 
dominating information in SAR images. The presence of 
speckle noise reduces the efficiency of traditional 
segmentations based on gray-level feature. Many 
traditional techniques of segmentation which rely on 
measures based on differences between pixel intensities 
suffer from noise when applied to SAR images [2]. Some 
filtering schemes havc been proposed for removing 
speckle, such as the Lee multiplicativc filter [3]. However, 
existing speckle filtering algorithms can effectively rcduce 
the speckle effect but unfortunately also, to some degree, 
smear edges and blur images, This is why 
traditional segmentation methods sometimes do not 
perform very well in edge areas. 
This paper proposed a new segmentation mcthod without 
noise filtering. The method proposed combin cs gray-level, 
edge and texture infomlation, and can determine the 
number of classes automatically. 
2. FEATURE EXTRACTION 
Texture feature 
Texture is an important additional feature for classification 
purposes. Te)l/ure involves the spatial distribution of gray­
levels in a local region. It contains important information 
about he structural arrangement of surfaecs and their 
relationship to their neighboring surfaces. 
Here we use wavelet energy to extract texture feature of 
SAR image. Each pixel responses to a neighborhood with 
N pixels in length and N pixcls in width. Every 
neighborhood is transformed by wavelet and responses to 
3 high frequency and I low frequency components 
s ubbands (as fig I il lustrates). Wavelet encrgy is defined 
as 
1 NxN-I 2 
e==-- Ils(x,y)1 NxN ,.)"=0 (
I) 
,where, S(X,y) is the coefficient of component subband, 
A Daubechics3 wavelet was used [4]. That is, each pixel 
responses to 4 wavelet energies, 
Gray-level feature 
Due to deduce the impact of the specklc, we use regional 
statistics to extract gray-level features. Here we usc mean 
and standard deviation of gray-level in the neighborh ood. 
Edge feature 
Traditional segmentation methods based on regional 
information sometimes do not perfonn very well in edge 
areas . One of the reasons is that neighborhood in edge 
areas contains two or more classcs of pixels, which make 
739

the center pixel very difficult to be classified. To ensure the 
accuracy of segmentation in edge area, we define a edge 
preserving mean of gray-level features

then the s ub-areas can be divided into two sets Hj and Lj

3. SEGMENTATION BASED ON CLUSTERING 
Image segmentation can be divided into two catalogs: 
supervised and unsupervised methods .  Supervised 
segmentation methods may get better results, but they 
require training data and can not be applied in real time 
environments. Clustering algorithm [5] is the main 
component of unsupervised methods. fuzzy C mean (fCM) 
is a common and useful algorithm whose results suffer 
from the choosing of initial clustering centers. And 
another drawback is that the number of classes must be 
determined before FCM runs. Here a novel clustering 
algorithm is presented which can determine the number of 
classes automatically. The core idea is that the data have 
the big relationship are always similar. The steps of the 
novel clustering algorithmas follow: 
Suppose X = {XI ,Xl , ... , xJ is the set of input vectors, 
each vector is Xi = {x,(l), x,(2), ... , xi(p)} , then 
1. define Vi (i = I ,2, .. . ,n) and let Vi = Xj 
2. compute the relationship between Viand Vj 
Ih-�J ] , ;ool,2, . .. ,n, 
20' 
J=I,2, . . . ,/l 
3. change the relationship between Vi and V} 
if rij <£ 
otherwise 
,where, C; is a little positive real number 
(5) 
(6) 
4. compute Wj ={Wj(l),"�(2), ... , ll;(p)} as follow 
:2." r.v {=I u j 
'Vi=

" 
f.. j=.L !I 
, i= 1,2, . . ·,11 (7) 
5. If all Wi are identical to Vi ' goto step 6, otherwise 
let Vi = Wi and return to step 2. 
6. The input vectors with the same convergent vectors 
Vi (i = 1,2, ... , II ) is classified into the same class. 
And the convergent vectors are the clustering 
centers. The number of the classes is just the number 
of converge nt vectors with different values. 
Each pixel responses to a neighborhood with N pixels in 
length and N pixels in width. When we apply proposed 
clustering algorithm to SAR image segmentation, we 
extract regional feature vectors with 7 components 
X = (Xl ,x2, .. ·,X7 ) . XI .\4 denotes LL,LH,HL,HH 
wavelet energies as fig. I illustrates. Xs and -"6 are the 
gray-level mean and standard deviation of region pixels. 
XI is the edge preserving mean of gmy-Ievel features. 
From above clustering algorithm, we notice that a 
,,'x,,, relationship matrix is computed in every flop. When 
number of input vectors is less, the memo!), and 
computing cost problem is not obvious. But when it is 
applied in image segmentation which needs to classify 
every pixel, the large memory space demanded always 
goes beyond the real physics memo!)' which will cause the 
740 
Proceedings of 2004 International Symposium on Intelligent Multimedia, Video and Speech Processing October 20-22,2004 Hang Kong 
computation impossible. So we developed an improved 
method which just computes one row vectors each flop. 
That is from stcp2 to stepS we just compute 
1", =exp[-" V -VI r). j=I,2, . .. ,1l (8) . 2cr1 
The memory space demanded and computation cost is 
R:duced. A example is given to validate this. Fig.3(1) is 
artificial data and Fig,3(2), (1).(4) arc the fmncr method 
clustering result, improved method clustering result and 
FCM clustering result respectively. From Fig.3, we can see 
both the former method and improved method can classify 
the data correctly. Whereas FCM classifies some data 
falsely (the * points denote the location of the clustering 
centers). Table I shows the running time comparison with 
different image size. We can sec that as the input vectors 
number increases, the improved method take less 
computing time than former one.

4. EXPERIMENT 
We apply our method to SAR image and compare thc 
result with other algorithms. Herc we set (j=O.2 
.; = 0.01. Fig.4 (I) is the original SAR image,and fig.4 (2) is 
the segmcntation result of proposcd algorithm Fig.4 (3) -

respectively. As Fig.4.illustrates, the result of proposed 
method is better than others. 
[n many clustering algorithms, standard deviation of gauss 
function, (J , affects the segmentation results grcatly. From 
proposed clustering algorithm, we notice that (j affects 
the relationship of data. and affcets the number of classes 
(as fig.S illustrates). Besides, due to the diffcrence of gray­
level distribution of different image, the same (J may get 
differcnt results. So the choosing of a is very important, 
which nced further research .

5. CONCLUSION 
Based on effective feature extraction and novel algorithm, 
an unsupervised SAR image segmentation method is 
proposed. Considering three dominating information: gray­
level, edge and texture information make SAR image 
accurate segmentation possible. And the proposed 
clustering algorithm can automatically detemlincd the 
number of classes, which is much better than FCM. 
Segmentation results on real SAR image demonstrate the 
effectiveness of the proposed method. Further research is 
focused on choosing cr .
