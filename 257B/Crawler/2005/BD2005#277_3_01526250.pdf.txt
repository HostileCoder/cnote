Abstract- The generation of meteorological surfaces from point-
source data is an overwork in computing evapotranspiration in 
Haihe River Basin. To date, the software in common use can't 
meet this demand. Here we offer a high efficient, flexible, 
integrated interpolation system that employs a database to store 
climate weather data, a choice of interpolation methods, 
validation and carry on batch processing. We performed 
validations for five meteorological variables (minimum and 
maximum temperature, relative humidity, average wind speed 
and air pressure) with inverse distance weighting (IDW), thin 
plate smoothing spline (SPLINE) and ordinary kriging (OK) and 
achieved comparable success among all interpolation methods. 
IDW and OK precision are superior to SPLINE, but SPLINE is 
more effective and smoothing. There is not too big difference 
between IDW and OK, and the precision obviously improves 
after temperature and pressure are revised with the terrain.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
With an area of 318,000 square kilometers and a 
population of 120million, the Haihe river basin is one of the 
seven largest basins in China. As China’s political and 
cultural center and an economically developed region, the 
basin enjoys a critical position in China. What is inappropriate 
to its key status is its ecological crisis because of natural water 
deficit. The correct estimation of water requirements is 
therefore an important step towards the development of 
efficient water management policies. 
It is the largest consumer of water resources due to the 
extensive surface that crops utilize during their development. 
Rosegrant identify both climatic variability and the 
competition for water among economic sectors, as two key 
issues that have to be taken into account for the design of 
efficient water allocation policies [1]. Evapotranspiration (ET) 
is important components of the hydrologic cycle. Estimations 
of ET are also essential in total satisfaction of crop water 
demands [2]. The new procedures and guidelines have been 
recently published in the FAO Irrigation and Drainage series 
and include the adoption of the Penman–Monteith (PM) 
approach as the new standard for determining reference crop 
ET calculations [3]. Minimum and maximum temperature, 
relative humidity, average wind speed and surface air pressure 
are five essential inputs in estimation of ET, based on PM 
model. But the generation of meteorological surfaces from 
point-source data is an overwork. To date, the software in 
common use can't meet this demand. 
Here we offer a high efficient, flexible, integrated 
interpolation system that employs a database to store climate 
weather data, a choice of interpolation methods, validation and 
carry on batch processing. We test IDW, SPLINE, OK 
performed similarly across all variables, and try to find which 
method is suiting for the five kinds of climatic data in Haihe 
River Basin. 
II. METHOD  
A. System Framework  
We developed a high efficient, flexible, integrated 
interpolation system. A flow diagram of the system is shown 
in figure 1 that indicates its modular design and functional 
relationships between data acquisition, storage, batch 
processing, Removal of erroneous data, interpolation and 
projection as surface variables.   
 
Figure 1.  Flow diagram of the system  
B. Data Retrieval and Storage 
We obtained daily climate weather data from China 
Meteorological Bureau. The system automatically retrieves 
the most current data and stores these data in the relational 
database. Currently, these weather data are updated by China 
Meteorological Bureau daily and provided observations of 
minimum and maximum temperatures, relative humidity, 
average wind speed and air pressure for approximately 81 
stations near Haihe River Basin. Observations are available 
from late 1990 to the present. The co-ordinate system and 
projection of the surface grids are as follows: Ellipsoid is 
Krasovsky; no Datum definition; Projection is Albers Conical 
Equal Area, two stand latitude are 25 °N and 47 °N;  false 
easting is 4000000 meters; longitude of central meridian is 
110°E and no northing definition. The output from this system 
will be in this map projection system, as this is commonly

used for large area maps in China. Elevation (meters) is 
explicitly considered as a third dimension due to the 
covariance of many weather variables with changes in 
elevation. 
C. Interpolation Method 
We implemented ordinary kriging (OK) [4], thin plate 
smoothing spline (SPLINE) [5] and inverse distance 
weighting (IDW) [6] as interpolators. OK calculates 
predictions using two components: a matrix of covariances 
between observations and a matrix of covariances between the 
observations and the prediction point. These covariances were 
determined from a spherical semivariogram model. SPLINE 
fitted to data sets distributed across an unlimited number of 
climate station locations [7]. It has been applied in numerous 
regions including Australia, New Zealand, Europe, South 
America, Africa and China. IDW weighs the contribution of 
each observation by the squared reciprocal of its distance to 
the prediction point. The IDW method truncates observations 
at some distance from the prediction point [6]. 
D. Removal of erroneous data  
To aid in the identification and removal of erroneous data, 
the interpolated climate surfaces were constructed using a 
two-pass interpolation scheme [8]. Observed data were 
interpolated in a first pass and residuals computed for all data 
points. The residual is the difference between the observed 
and interpolated values. Data points with high residuals may 
be indicative of erroneous data and were excluded from a 
subsequent interpolation which generated the final surface 
from which the patched datasets were constructed. A datum 
was rejected if the associated residual exceeded a fixed 
threshold. The thresholds were: 1.4°C and 1.6°C for 
maximum and minimum temperatures, respectively; 3.5 hPa 
for pressure; 10.0% for relative humidity; and 1.5m/s for 
average wind speed. The preceding thresholds were selected 
as they typically remove about 1–2% of the observed data. If 
the procedure rejected more than 5% of data from a given 
dataset, the threshold was adjusted so that not more than 5% 
of data would be rejected. Experience has shown the two-pass 
interpolation scheme can accurately detect and remove gross 
outliers in observed data. In some cases genuinely correct data 
may be removed, but this cost must be weighed against the 
effect that erroneous data can have on an interpolated surface. 
III. RESULTS 
A. Interpolation of Climate Data 
1)Temperatures 
The spatial variation of temperatures is distinct with the 
terrain. Local topography can modify substantially the 
relationship between elevation and temperature [9]. It is 
universal that the temperature drops with rising of the vertical 
height, but the lapse rate is various in different place .Here we 
apply the average lapse rate of −0.65K/100m. 
AETT += 0                                           (1) 
Where T is the observed station level temperatures (℃)，T0 is 
the sea level temperature (℃), E is vertical height(m), A is 
average lapse rate of  −0.65K/100m. 
We calculate station level temperature using “(1)” and 
generate the sea level temperature surface grids. But in the 
PM model the station temperatures surface grids is necessary. 
So we use DEM (Digital Elevation Model data) to convert the 
sea level temperature surface grids into the observed (station 
level) temperature surface grids. 
(-A)*y]DEM[x,y][x,Grid y]Grid[x, 0 +=            (2) 
Where Grid[x,y] is the value of station temperature surface 
grid in (x,y); Grid0[x,y] is the value of sea level temperature 
surface grid in (x,y); DEM[x,y] is the value of station DEM 
grid in (x,y); A is average lapse rate of −0.65K/100m.  
We interpolated the temperature of July 1st, 2003 from 
China Meteorological Bureau of the daily data using OK, 
SPLINE, IDW and got the result (see Figure2).In of Figure2, 
minimum, maximum temperatures of row A weren’t revised 
with the terrain; minimum, maximum temperatures of row B 
were revised with the terrain.

2)Pressures 
The spatial variation in observed pressure can be reduced 
if the topographic component is removed. This is done by 
converting the observed (station level) pressure into mean sea 
level pressure [10]:

and dry-bulb temperatures, station level pressure, and the 
station’s elevation (z) and latitude. If wet- and dry-bulb 
temperatures are unavailable, an approximate mean sea level

In the paper wet- and dry-bulb temperatures are unavailable, 
and we use the simple exponential decay model to compute 
the Mean sea level pressure. We use “(4)” to generate the sea 
level pressure surface grids. But in the model of PM the 
station pressure is necessary. So we also use DEM to convert 
the sea level pressure surface grids into the observed (station 
level) pressure surface grids.

We also tested the pressure of July 1st, 2003 from China

3) Relative Humidity and Wind Speed 
Topoclimatic effects can result from the influence of 
terrain on mountain winds and the generation of airflow 
effects such as cold air drainage [11].But the relationship 
between terrain and wind is complex, in this paper we aim at 
find which interpolator is suing for wind speed and relative 
humidity. 
We tested relative humidity and wind speed to generate the 
surface grids using OK, SPLINE, IDW. The data is July 1st, 
2003 from China Meteorological Bureau of the daily data. The 
results are presented in Figure 4, Figure 5.

B. Cross-validation 
To test the system, we performed cross-validation for daily 
minimum and maximum temperature, relative humidity, 
average wind speed and air pressure over the Haihe River 
Basin for the entire year of 2003, excluding 10 missing days, 
using ordinary kriging (OK), thin plate smoothing spline 
(SPLINE) and inverse distance weighting (IDW). For each 
variable, we estimated the mean absolute error (MAE) and 
standard deviation （SDEV） to quantify the accuracy and 
precision of our predictions 
Results of daily cross-validation for OK, SPLINE and IDW 
for the Haihe River Basin for 2003 are presented in Table 1. In 
general, the three test methods performed similarly across all 
variables. Temperatures predicted with OK had lower MAE 
than those predicted with SPLINE and IDW, but three methods 
showed a marked improvement with the terrain. Pressure 
predicted with IDW was low relative to the MAE and SDEV 
in the OK and SPLINE, but three methods showed a marked 
improvement with the terrain. Relative Humidity with IDW 
was also low relative to the MAE and SDEV in the OK and 
SPLINE. Wind MAE predicted with SPLINE was high relative 
to the MAE in the OK and IDW. The error matrices for these 
precipitation occurrence methods are presented in Table 1.

Table 1 presented cross-validation results for each of the 
five key weather variables for the the Haihe River Basin for 
2003 using OK, SPLINE and IDW. Where A isn’t revised with 
the terrain; B is revised with the terrain. For example, A.Tmax 
is the maximum temperature revised with the terrain, and 
B.Pressure is the Pressure which isn’t revised with the terrain.

IV. DISCUSSION  
Although there are a number of common desktop software 
applications that can both parse the available weather data and 
interpolate these data to continuous surfaces, these software 
products lack the ability to perform project, batch processing, 
removal of erroneous data, data revised with the terrain. 
Evapotranspiration modeling studies often require historical 
datasets in order to properly account for long-term trends. 
Such datasets would be tedious to create using common 
desktop software because of the intense amount of user 
interaction required. Our system can flexible, efficiently 
generate such data with minimal initial user interaction, 
especially using batch processing. 
We test the daily data of Minimum and maximum 
temperature, relative humidity, average wind speed and surface 
air pressure of the Haihe River Basin for 2003, and 
comparisons between OK, SPLINE and IDW interpolation 
methods show very small differences between the three logics. 
It is, however, important to note that OK develops 
interpolation weights not only on the relationship between the 
prediction point and observation point but rather a combination 
of those relationships and the relationships between 
observation points [12]. There are very great relations between 
the climatic data and topography. The precision obviously 
improves after temperature and pressure is revised with the 
terrain. Although the wind speed is also affected by 
topography, in this paper, we have not considered it. 
V. CONCLUSIONS 
We developed a high efficient, flexible, integrated 
interpolation system that employs a database to store point 
information, a choice of weather data interpolation method, 
validation and carry on batch processing using to compute 
evapotranspiration in Haihe River Basin. We used DEM to 
revise the spatial variation in observed temperature and 
pressure. We also presented examples of interpolating five 
meteorological variables (minimum and maximum 
temperatures, relative humidity, Average Wind Speed and Air 
Pressure) for July 1st, 2003 from China Meteorological Bureau 
of the day using OK, SPLINE and IDW. OK and IDW 
precision are superior to SPLINE, but SPLINE is more 
effective and smoothing. The precision obviously improves 
after temperature and pressure is revised with the terrain. By 
incorporating the dependencies on elevation, the interpolated 
values showed a more complex pattern, which were in good 
agreement with the temperatures and Pressure characteristics 
of the location and its interaction with the terrain. This system, 
we believe, represents an effective way of increasing the 
application of computing evapotranspiration.
