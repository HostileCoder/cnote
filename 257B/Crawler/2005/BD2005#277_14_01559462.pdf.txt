Abstract—A certain level of immunity to narrowband 
interference is inherent in a direct sequence spread spectrum 
(DSSS) signal. In many applications a system using notch 
filters rejects any narrowband interference occurring in the 
spread-spectrum band. Depending upon the number of 
notches, the notch width, the notch depth, and the locaton of 
the notches within the spread-spectrum band, the bit-error 
rate (BER) performance degradation varies. The spread 
signal distortion and the resulting intersymbol interference 
(ISI) at the chip level cannot always be directly accounted 
for in the data BER through analysis, and it is much easier 
to employ Monte Carlo simulation techniques to 
characterize the BER degradation. In some scenarios a 
notch-filtered spread-spectrum signal may also result in 
blanking certain portions of the spread-spectrum signal to 
satisfy regulatory requirements.  In such situations it is 
important to know the level of degradation a priori so that it 
can be accounted for in the link performance.  
 
In this paper we describe the simulation work carried out to 
relate the notch-filtering effect of the spread signal on the 
BER followed by simulation results.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Spread-spectrum techniques are commonly used in both 
military and civil communication and navigation systems 
for their inherent ability to provide immunity against both 
intentional and unintentional interference. Further reduction 
in narrowband interference effects can be achieved by 
notching out the narrowband interference, which is 
generally done using the adaptive transversal filters (ATF) 
in the time domain or using adaptive excision filters (AEF) 
in the frequency domain. Both of these filters adapt to place 
the notches where the interference location might be 
moving within the band. Also, both ATF and AEF are 
implemented in the receivers to remove the interference 
signal arriving along with the desired signal. There is also 
another reason for performing the notch filtering (this time 
at the transmitter): so that the transmitted signal will not 
interfere with any preexisting or legacy signal. This 
situation may arise when the same service provider to share 
the frequency band with the legacy system introduces new 
signals in the allocated frequency band or an entirely new 
system is developed to share the frequency band with other 
service providers already existing in the band. In all these 
scenarios a certain portion of the frequency band is notched 
out, thereby reducing the amount of useful signal available 
for detection. This reduction of the useful signal will 
degrade the bit-error rate (BER) performance. The 
degradation is dependent on the number of notches, the 
notch width, the notch depth, and the location of the notches 
within the spread-spectrum band. Furthermore, because of 
the notches the signal correlation properties are changed, 
thereby affecting the spreading code acquisition and 
tracking performance. Spreading code acquisition and 
tracking are very important in navigation systems such as 
the Global Positioning System (GPS), which employs 
direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) for improving the 
range accuracy. 
 
We limit our discussion in this paper to the BER 
considerations when the DSSS signals are notch filtered to 
remove narrowband interference. The simulation work 
carried out to relate the notch-filtering effect of the spread 
signal on the BER, followed by simulation results, is given 
in this paper.

2. NOTCH-FILTERED DSSS SIGNAL 
 
We consider a direct-sequence spread-spectrum system in 
which the data rate is 2400 bits per second (bps) and the 
spreading code chipping rate is 2.3 megachips per second 
(MCPS). We also assume binary phase shift keyed (BPSK) 
modulation for both the data and the spreading code. We 
assume a notch filter with a 30 dB notch at various parts of 
the spread spectrum band with notch widths as shown in 
Figures 1-8.

In all of the figures, the power before and after notch 
filtering is maintained at the same level, and the G value 
shown in the figure caption is the gain used to renormalize 
the filter output power. Note that in this process we have 
not only removed (with 30 dB notch) certain frequency 
components from the power spectral densities but also 
increased the remaining frequency components to maintain 
the power constant that in effect distorts the time domain 
signal. Two effects can be expected because of notch 
filtering. First, because of the distortion due to notch 
filtering, we can expect to see a loss in correlation peak 
between the reference spreading code and the incoming 
signal. Second, there may be intersymbol interference (ISI) 
at the spreading code chip level but may it not be at the data 
symbol level. The severity of the impacts of these two 
effects is studied through simulation that is discussed in the 
next section.

3. DESCRIPTION OF SIMULATION MODEL 
A simulation model was created using the SystemView 
(copyright Elanix Inc.) software to study the effects of 
notch filtering a DSSS signal on BER. A block diagram of 
the simulation model is given in Figure 9. 
 
 
 
Figure 9. Block Diagram of the Simulation Model 
 
In the simulation a data rate of 2400 bits per second and a 
spreading code chipping rate of 2.3 MCPS was used. As 
mentioned earlier BPSK was used for both the data and 
spread spectrum modulation. The notch filters were 
implemented using 6-pole Chebyshev low-pass, high-pass 
(HPF) and band-reject filters. For the low pass, the 3 dB 
cutoff frequency was set at 1.9 MHz, which resulted in 
attenuation of 30 dB or more beyond 2.69 MHz. This filter 
approximated the notch filter at the end of the mainlobe. An 
HPF implemented a notch at the center with the cutoff 
frequency set at 400 kHz with the result, an attenuation of 
more than 30 dB beyond 281 kHz. A Notch in the middle of 
the mainlobe was implemented by a band-reject filter with a 
greater than 30 dB rejection from 1.05 to 1.33 MHz. The 
filter responses are shown in Figures 10 through 12.

Figure 15. Input and the Middle Notch Filter Output 
Samples (Red = Input, Blue = Output)  
 
The input and the output samples from the three types of 
notch filters whose frequency responses are given in 
Figures 10 through 12 are given in Figures 13 through 15. 
In all these figures no adjustment has been made to account 
for the delay introduced by the filters. A close examination 
of these figures indicates that the center notch filter has 
distorted the signal the most and the end notch filter the 
least, as one would expect. We see the implication of this in 
the next section. 
     
4. SIMULATION RESULTS 
 
From the filter output samples in Figures 13 through 15, we 
can expect that the correlation function of the filtered 
spreading codes will also be distorted when the reference 
code is not filtered. Also, in addition to this distortion there 
may be inter chip interference (ICI), which is analogous to 
the intersymbol interference (ISI) for the data, again 
affecting the correlator output. It should also be pointed out 
here that when the notch filtering is done at the transmitter, 
the receiver may not know what part of the spread spectrum 
is notch filtered, and hence the receiver may be forced to 
use unfiltered code reference. However, if the notching is 
done at the receiver on the incoming signal, it is very easy 
to filter the reference code also to make the correlator more 
like a matched filter. Since notch filtering at the transmitter 
seems to be more difficult to deal with, we consider this 
case in this paper. 
 
The correlation functions for the filtered transmit signals are 
shown in Figure 16. From this figure it can be seen that the 
end notch filter has the least impact on the correlation peak. 
The correlation loss in this case is less than 0.5 dB. Also 
from the same figure we can see that the center notch filter 
has the highest correlation loss among the three filters. In 
this example the correlation loss for the center notch is 
about 5 dB. As one would expect, the middle notch has a 
somewhat lower correlation loss (2.7 dB) than the center 
notch filtered case. These results seem to be intuitive since 
the signal power spectral density has a peak at the center 
and the density function itself follows the classical sinc2 
function. This particular filter will introduce the most 
distortion in the signal. Since the correlation process takes 
into account the similarity between the received and the 
reference signals, a highly distorted received signal would 
result in higher correlation loss even when the power is 
maintained to be constant. Also note the side lobe peaks 
coming up for both the center and the middle notch-filtered 
DSSS signal. This indicates that the code acquisition 
process is going to be more difficult, especially for the 
center notched signal with the possibility of false lock. 
Rounding of the correlation peak will result in poor code 
tracking, meaning higher tracking error variance, which in 
turn would increase the BER.

Unfiltered Reference 
 
As mentioned earlier, if the code reference at the receiver is 
also notch filtered to match the incoming signal, there is a 
better match in the shapes of the two signals, and hence the 
correlation loss ideally should disappear. This is shown in 
Figure 17.

Figure 18. BER versus Eb/N0 - Theory and Simulation 
 
A Monte Carlo simulation was performed with the 
parameter values set as described above and the BER was 
obtained. The results are presented in Figure 18. There is 
excellent agreement between the theoretical and simulation 
results for the case of no notch filter and Eb/N0 set at 5 and 7 
dB. At 9 dB the simulation results were about 0.5 dB more 
optimistic than the theoretical results, and it is conjectured 
that the number of bits simulated may not have been enough 
for the statistics to reach steady state. As for the end notch 
filter, the simulation results show very good consistency 
with the theory. But for the center notch filter case, the 
simulation results show 3.4 dB degradation in comparison 
to a correlation loss of 5 dB, which is 1.6 dB optimistic. 
Correlation loss itself was obtained through simulation.  
Using this as the reference to compute the degradation using 
other simulation results may magnify the difference. 
However, observing the above results, it can easily be said 
that a center notch filter would degrade the BER 
performance from 4 to 5 dB, and a similar notch at the end 
of the main lobe would result in only about 0.5 dB 
degradation, and the average degradation expected would 
be close to 2 dB.   
 
6.  CONCLUSIONS AND FURTHER WORK 
 
In this paper we have shown that notching the transmitted 
DSSS signal at the transmitter to avoid interference with 
other signals that are not DSSS sharing the same frequency 
band would degrade the bit-error performance on the order 
of 0.5 to 5 dB. Of course, the actual degradation is a 
function of the notch width, notch depth, and notch location 
within the spread spectrum band. There is reasonably good 
agreement between the theory and the simulation, especially 
as the notch is moved towards the end of the mainlobe. It 
was also noted that renormalizing the filtered power to be 
the same as the unfiltered one may actually increase the 
signal distortion and hence increase the correlation loss and 
the BER. Also, if the notching is done at the receiver (for 
example) to remove narrowband interference, then the 
reference code can also be filtered to minimize the 
correlation loss or possibly remove it completely. So the 
problem addressed in this paper is more important to the 
case where the receiver has no knowledge of where to put 
the notch at the reference code and how wide should it be. 
 
It was also observed in this paper that even if the BER 
degradation is within the acceptable limit the signal 
distortion is severe enough to interfere with the code 
acquisition and tracking process. False lock points are 
introduced in the correlation curves because of the distorted 
signal; this aspect needs a careful study. Any spectrum 
shaping such as raised-cosine filter or Square Root Raised-
Cosine Filter may accentuate the signal distortion due to 
notch filtering. This also requires further study. Also, 
another careful look at the simulation may be necessary if 
the gap of over 1 dB should be narrowed.
