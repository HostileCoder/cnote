Abstract— Injector fuel stems in Orbiter and SRB Auxiliary 
Power Units (APU) gas generators are subject to 
operational damage effects that can result in fuel stem 
failure.  In addition, Orbiter APU gas generator fuel stems 
are subject to a buildup of nitride on the chromized interior 
surfaces due to the presence of hydrazine and high 
temperature conditions near the bottom of the fuel stem that 
can result in an increased susceptibility to corrosion.  Over 
time, the Orbiter nitride layers may degrade resulting in 
microcracks, which expose the underlying chromized layer 
to potential corrosion and failure.  Nitride thickness 
variations are a critical parameter in this application and 
provide an indicator of susceptibility to corrosion and 
microcracking.  Left undetected, damage to both Orbiter 
and SRB gas generators can lead to an in-flight failure with 
possible catastrophic consequences.  Current inspection 
technologies, including borescope inspections, may indicate 
some anomalies, but no nondestructive testing capability 
exists that can quantify the nitride thickness and/or damage 
inside the injector fuel stem.  The development of an 
inspection technology that can detect stress effects, 
degradation of the nitride layer, and the presence of 
microcracking inside the fuel stem is a key concern for 
Orbiter/SRB APU gas generator reliability. 
 
Positron Systems’ new material inspection technology, 
Distributed Source Positron Annihilation (DSPA), has 
demonstrated the capability to quantify the effects of 
material degradation and the onset of microcracking in 
metals and composite materials at any point in life.  The 
DSPA probe was successfully utilized to nondestructively 
evaluate changes in nitride thickness and damage for both 
Orbiter and SRB injector fuel stems (0.095-0.100” ID) in-
situ.  These measurement results were then compared to as 
manufactured and in-service APU injector fuel stems to 
assess accumulated damage.  Results from these 
measurements indicated that DSPA could provide 
nondestructive, quantitative data to assess nitride layer 
thickness and damage effects inside the fuel stem such as 
strain and related damage effects.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Orbiter gas generators are subject to potential failure due to 
operational damage caused by exposure to hydrazine during 
use, and corrosion that may occur if the nitride layer that 
develops in the hot section of the fuel stem degrades.  The 
primary damage inspection method currently used for these 
components is visual inspection by borescope.  Because of 
the configuration of the gas generators, the potential for 
induced crack damage, residual stresses/strains, and 
corrosion effects that may result in near term cracking and 
failure of the stems are significant issues affecting the 
potential for reuse of the gas generators.          
The objective of this project was to demonstrate the 
capability of Positron Systems’ DSPA technology to detect 
near surface microstructural changes on the interior surface 
of fuel stems in-situ for the following: 1) fuel stems in gas 
generator assemblies with a range of operational periods, 2) 
 2
a non hot-fired assembly, and 3) a wall thickness test 
specimen. 
The DSPA probe is a specialized positron emitter source 
which produces 3-MeV positrons that penetrate several 
millimeters into the injector fuel stem material (Hastelloy 
B).  As the positrons thermalize in the atomic 
microstructure of the fuel stem, they interact with the lattice 
structure, becoming “trapped” at irregularities in the crystal 
lattice structure. When a positron annihilates with an 
electron at the imperfection, two 511 keV gamma rays are 
produced.  The Doppler-broadened energy distribution of 
the annihilation gamma rays is indicative of accumulated 
damage and nitride deposition effects in the fuel stem. 
DSPA measurements are highly accurate with typical 
uncertainties of approximately 0.1%. The positron 
annihilation response can be detected through intervening 
layers of material up to 2 inches thick.  Comparisons of the 
measured S Parameter values for as-manufactured, 
operational and failed injector stems provides the basis for 
developing “fitness for use” criteria or remaining life 
estimates.  This study indicated that the DSPA process is 
sensitive to effects of various surface layers, damage, and 
material conditions expected on the interior surface of the 
APU injector fuel stem.       
 2. PIPA/DSPA MEASUREMENT PROCESS  
The Induced Positron Annihilation (IPA) technologies were 
recently developed at the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). 
 The Photon Induced Positron Annihilation (PIPA) 
technology is a volumetric measurement technology that 
can measure damage at depths up to 4 inches in materials 
through the use of high energy photons.  Derivative 
technologies, Neutron Induced Positron Annihilation 
(NIPA) and Distributive Source Positron Annihilation 
(DSPA) have volumetric and near-surface assay capabilities 
respectively.  These technologies are new, significant 
additions to current material characterization technologies. 
 
Positron annihilation measurement technology has been 
used extensively as a surface measurement technology. 
Documented studies illustrate positron annihilation as a 
viable method for material characterization at the atomic 
lattice structure level.   These studies have confirmed that 
positron annihilation techniques are applicable to assessing 
damage in a wide range of materials, including metals and 
composites.     
 
Specific improvements developed at INL and incorporated 
into the IPA technologies are: 
 Use of high-energy photons (15-20 MeV) and neutron 
generators/sources to generate neutron deficient nuclei 
in materials (e.g., most metals, composites and 
polymers) that in many cases produce positrons within 
bulk material that allow bulk fatigue or lattice structure 
change/damage to be measured in either a research or 
process measurement environment. 
 Use of digital data acquisition electronics that allow 
highly reproducible, stable gamma spectrometry and 
positron life-time measurements to be made to assess 
bulk defects or the characteristics of various inclusions 
in the metals or other materials. 
 Portable gamma spectrometry measurement systems 
and linear accelerators that can be easily transported for 
use in field, confined spaces or manufacturing facility 
environments.  
 Related processes that do not use accelerators but allow 
wide-area measurements (up to 100 cm2) to be made 
and near-surface assessments with penetration depths 
up to 3-5 mm to be performed.  Other more portable 
approaches, based on neutron induced prompt gamma 
rays are under development. 
 Improvements in activation methods and detection 
protocols result in minimal to no material activation or 
residual activity. 
 
The PIPA process generates positrons inside the bulk 
material through the application of high-energy X-ray 
bombardment of the target component by a linear 
accelerator.  Positrons are formed when the X-ray 
interactions result in a neutron being ejected from a small 
number of atoms within the material (photo-neutron 
reaction).  The short-lived isotope decays into a more stable 
material through positron decay within a few minutes or 
hours.  Positrons annihilate with electrons and produce 
gamma rays at 0.511 MeV (511keV) with small momentum 
induced changes that are indicative of the quantity and type 
of defects present in the material.   
 
The DSPA process utilizes either a PIPA system or a much 
smaller shielded neutron generator system, NIPA, to 
produce a high energy positron emitter source in a 
configurable probe (i.e. a flat sheet or rod configuration of 
desired dimensions).  This probe is placed over the surface 
to be examined.  The DSPA probe can be configured to 
almost any shape to provide minimal to no impact on the 
inspection technique caused by complex component 
geometries.  In addition, measurements can be performed in 
multilayer structures through outer layers of material (e.g., 
steel) up to several inches thick.    
The high energy positrons penetrate into the surface of the 
material to be examined and produce low level annihilation 
radiation that can be measured with a germanium detector 
that can be up to 12 inches away from the surface being 
measured, and through up to 1-2 inch of steel.  The 
positron-emitting probe produces positrons for 10-15 
minutes or up to several hours that are sufficient to perform 
the DSPA measurement.  The DSPA process is sufficiently 
automated such that an operator with limited training can 
perform the measurements.   
 3
Positron annihilation occurs when a positron encounters an 
electron and their mass is converted into pure energy in the 
form of two gamma rays.  If the positron and the electron 
with which it annihilates were both at rest or with little 
momentum at the time of decay, (i.e., in a defect), the two 
gamma rays would be emitted in exactly opposite directions 
(180 degrees apart), with an energy of 0.511 MeV, whereas 
if the annihilation occurs in a location without defects, the 
gamma ray measured has incremental, measurable 
differences from 0.511 MeV (Conservation of Energy).  
Figure 1 shows the PIPA/NIPA processes for volumetric 
measurements and the creation of the DSPA probe for near-
surface measurements.  Figure 2 depicts the formation and 
subsequent thermalization of the positron as it travels 
through the lattice structure, searching for a lower charge 
density region (defected area), where it becomes trapped 
and then annihilates with an electron.  The energy level of 
the annihilation gammas released is indicative of the level 
of damage. 
 
Figure 1 – PIPA/NIPA and DSPA Processes 
The positrons created by the PIPA/NIPA processes are 
formed throughout the bulk material, achieving better 
sensitivity and accuracy of defect detection than surface 
positron beam spectroscopy.  The depth of defect detection 
is only limited by the attenuation of the annihilation 
gammas to be measured by the germanium detector; related 
to the material density (Thicknesses/depths up to 4 inches 
possible).  The DSPA process is a near-surface assay tool 
and predominantly provides information on microstructural 
changes in the top 0.1-5mm of the component depending on 
the density of the material.  This process is extremely 
sensitive to surface treatment effects such as shot-peening 
and cold working in holes.  Additional information on the 
measurement processes used can be obtained from a number 
of references. 1-7

Data Analysis Methodology 
The positron data analysis is based on characterization of 
the shape of the 511 keV peak.   The annihilation energy 
(511 keV) of the annihilating positrons is incrementally 
affected by the momentum of the electron with which the 
positron annihilates.  Defects contain a higher ratio of free 
electrons to core electrons than non-defected materials.  
This phenomenon can be explained by the tendency of free 
(conduction) electrons to lose energy and slow down or stop 
in the defect.  Core electrons have a much higher linear 
momentum than do free electrons.  Thus, gamma rays from 
annihilation events involving free electrons are more likely 
to approximate the peak energy (511 keV).  This 
characteristic makes it possible to detect the presence of 
defects from the energy spectrum of the gamma ray 
emission when the positron and electron interact.1,2,3  
The primary measurement technique used is measuring the 
Doppler broadening of the 511 keV gamma ray peak.  
Although in principle, the Doppler broadened gamma ray 
spectrum can be deconvoluted to extract the electron 
momentum distribution, a simple shape parameter is 
commonly used to characterize the annihilation peak.  Two 
parameters, S (for shape) and W (wings) are usually 
employed.  The S-parameter is defined as the ratio of the 
counts (i.e., area) in a central region of the spectral peak to 
the total counts (area) in the peak, and W-parameter is 
defined as the ratio of counts in the wing region of the peak 
to the total counts in the peak.  In many cases, only the high 
side of the peak is used due to detector ballistic deficit 
effects on the low energy side of the gamma ray peak.4   
 
The S and W parameters have a simple relationship to the 
Doppler broadening (e.g., if the annihilation peak is narrow, 
which results when positrons predominately annihilate with 
slow moving electrons, the S-parameter is large and with 
fast moving core electrons the S parameter is small).  These 
annihilations with the valence electrons are reflected in the 
 4
S parameter and those with core electrons in the W-
parameter. This “line shaping parameter” or “S” factor for 
the material is compared to known “S” factors for similar 
“as manufactured” and failed materials to quantitatively 
determine defect density and lifecycle percentage.5,6,7   
 
The use of simple parameters such as S and W produces 
extensive information about the open volume defects 
present.  The absolute values of the S and W parameters 
have little physical relevance since they are essentially 
dependent on the system setup.  However, the relative 
change in these parameters provides information on the 
damage distribution in the material.  Further, the S and W 
data can be plotted to provide further information on the 
relative damage levels that are present and show the 
distribution of highly defected locations to those that have 
low levels of defects.  Figure 3 shows the basic method to 
achieve the S parameter and Figure 4 gives an example of 
the measurement spectra obtained for samples.

Improving Life Remaining Predictions 
The ability of IPA technologies to quantify lattice structure 
damage/change at the atomic level provides information on 
component/material structural integrity and remaining life 
never before available in a field or production environment. 
 This accurate assessment is achieved through establishment 
of the following: 
• Representative IPA data (line shape or “S” 
parameters) for the material and damage being 
characterized with a known dynamic range from 
“as manufactured” through failed test specimens 
or components.   
• Damage assessment of representative specimens 
or components by comparing the measured 
response to the dynamic range data to provide an 
accurate and quantifiable evaluation of existing 
lattice structure damage with known uncertainties. 
• The shape of the IPA S parameter response 
curves, indicative of structural damage, are 
generally consistent and allow the development of 
initial remaining life models with relatively few 
measurements.  
• Validation of the measurement/modeling process 
using in-situ measurements on actual components 
and component operational histories to provide an 
accurate prediction of remaining life.  
Based upon a series of components with varying 
operational histories, from day one of operation through 
failure or retirement from service, physically-based life 
cycle models can be developed and improved upon as 
additional components are measured, thereby improving 
accuracy and precision.  Figure 6 provides an example of a 
basic life cycle curve generated for fatigue damaged 
components.   In this case, operational damage was 
measured for an interrupted cycle analysis from “as 
manufactured” through failure.

IPA Technologies for Portability  
The IPA technologies developed indicate that derivative 
methods of inducing positrons into materials and 
components are possible leading to smaller, more portable 
designs; including demonstrated DSPA probe designs 
capable of inspections through borescope holes.  
Improvements in the miniaturization of electronics, faster 
computer processing speeds and development of smaller 
detectors have made it possible to build and operate a 
mobile inspection capability.  The Distributed Source 
Positron Annihilation technology (DSPA) is a near-surface 
inspection tool and has been used as a small probe for 
damage inspection in normally inaccessible areas. In 
addition, for some applications longer-lived source material 
can be installed in the component to be measured for long-
term inspection in a totally inaccessible area.  Figure 7 
shows the laboratory system to use a neutron generator to 
create the DSPA probe and Figure 8 displays the basic 
DSPA method of damage detection.  Figure 9 provides 
several configurable DSPA design applications.

 3. ORBITER GAS GENERATOR TEST PLAN   
The gas generator research approach was developed around 
two primary elements.  They were to: 1) assess the effects 
of starts and operating hours on the DSPA response from 
the fuel stem inspections, and 2) compare the results of two 
operational gas generators with a non hot-fired generator 
and a “high-time” gas generator, which had been exposed to 
numerous starts and long operational hours. Numerous 
measurements were performed on the four gas generator 
fuel stems measured as part of this test program.  Figure 10 
shows the non hot-fired gas generator subassembly and 
Figure 11 shows an actual gas generator in the measurement 
configuration used for these measurements.

4. DSPA MEASUREMENT ANALYSIS 
DSPA measurements were performed on three SRB gas 
generator fuel stems and the data are compared with the 
results obtained from the previously analyzed orbiter gas 
generator which had been retired from service and was 
measured in March, 2004.  The S Parameter profiles for the 
retired gas generator and the three operational gas 
generators are shown in Figures 12 and 13 respectively.  For 
the operational gas generator response (Figure 13), the S 
parameter results increase from the “as manufactured” stem 
in yellow through the high-time generator stem data in light 
purple.  These results indicate a monotonically increasing 
damage measurement effect that can be used to develop 
assessments of current damage and remaining life.

Uncertainties are on the order of the size of the symbol

A comparison between the DSPA response in the region 
from 1.0-2.25 in. and 2.5-3.0 in. was developed to define 
acceptable uncertainties in the response for individual 
measurements in these regions and to develop an initial 
correlation between starts and the DSPA S Parameter 
response. These results provide a measure of the expected 
dynamic range for the assessment of damage in other fuel 
stems and statistical confidence data that can be used to 
assess possible damage at these locations on fuel stems. 
Figure 14 shows the correlation between average S 
Parameter response and the number of starts.  A similar 
chart can be developed for operational hours.

5. CONCLUSIONS 
The Induced Positron Annihilation (IPA) process, 
Distributed Source Positron Annihilation (DSPA), has 
demonstrated the capability to quantify damage 
accumulation and nitride layer degradation in gas 
generator auxiliary power unit fuel stems for space shuttle 
applications that have been subjected to various levels of 
operational damage.  The purpose of this project was to 
demonstrate DSPA’s capability to quantify damage 
buildup in representative fuel stem components and 
correlate these results with the operational histories for 
those components.   
 
DSPA measurements have been performed on orbiter gas 
generator fuel stems and a wall thickness test specimen.  
The DSPA measurements performed on the gas 
generators indicate a clear basis for the development of 
good correlations between the DSPA response and 
operational hours that may also be used to accurately 
identify damage locations on the inner surface of the fuel 
stems.  Development of the IPA technologies for field use 
will have broad applications for both military and 
commercial aerospace industries through the development 
of a measurement database for the selected critical 
aerospace components that provides the basis for current 
damage and remaining life assessments.  This database 
will provide information on the correlation between the 
measurement response and the effects of a range of 
operational damage mechanisms and operational history 
data.  This will allow the measurement process to be 
optimized for specified components to provide the most 
accurate measure of damage and remaining life.   
 
Results of these SRB gas generator measurements 
provide consistent and reproducible data that correlate 
operational hours and starts with the DSPA S Parameter 
results.  These data provide clear measurement results that 
can be used to identify operational effects and damage in 
these fuel stems.  Empirical models that are suitable for 
accurately identifying operational damage effects can be 
developed based on these data.
