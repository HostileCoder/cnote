Abstract—The capacity of the United States’ National 
Airspace System (NAS) must double to handle the 
passenger demands that are projected over the next 25 years.  
NASA initiated the Virtual Airspace Modeling and 
Simulation (VAMS) Project in 2002 with participants, 
including members from industry, government, and 
academia to develop and share ideas on revolutionary 
concepts to meet the future demand. 12 
The constraints in the Terminal Area domain are the focus 
of Raytheon’s VAMS concept, Terminal Area Capacity 
Enhancement Concept (TACEC). TACEC envisions a high 
level of automation and synchronization, generating 
optimized 4D flight profiles to land/depart multiple aircraft 
“simultaneously” on closely spaced parallel runways.  
Implementation requires infrastructure improvements such 
as highly automated guidance and scheduling systems, 
timely data link, improved surveillance, and improved on-
board navigation systems.  This paper discusses the 
guidance and scheduling systems required to pair the 
aircraft for simultaneous landing.  Performance required by 
the autopilot/navigation system to maintain control 
necessary for formation flight onto closely spaced parallel 
runways, data link and surveillance requirements are also 
addressed.

We start with an overview of TACEC including a summary 
of the TACEC modes of operation (Initial Approach and 
Final Approach). The automation system required for 
pairing the aircraft and the performance required by the 
autopilot/navigation system to maintain control necessary 
for formation flight onto closely spaced parallel runways are 
discussed.  The projected traffic within the TACEC terminal 
environment and associated data link and surveillance 
requirements are also addressed. 
2.  TACEC OVERVIEW 
NASA’s VAMS Program is addressing the challenge of 
increasing the future NAS capacity by developing new 
approaches to air traffic management. Raytheon’s TACEC 
concept addresses the constraints in the terminal airspace. A 
preliminary concept evaluation showed that additional 
runways will be required to meet the 2 to 3x demand growth 
[1]. 
Today’s procedures require 4300 feet between runways 
without Precision Runway Monitor (PRM) and when PRM 
is in use, the separation can be reduced to 3000 feet.  
Improvements in navigation and surveillance may reduce 
this separation, but wake vortex becomes the limiting issue 
with separation distance less than 2500 ft.  Adding more 
independent runways would require almost two square miles 
of land, impossible for many urban airports that are likely to 
see the bulk of the capacity growth. Since land will not be 
available to build many more independent runways, another 
solution is needed. 
The fundamental limit on the number of aircraft that can 
operate from a runway according to today’s procedures is 
their “in trail” spacing used to protect from the vortex wakes 
generated at the lead aircraft’s wing   
Clearly wake vortex constrains today’s operations on 
dependent runways, and for flights landing on the same 
runway. TACEC addresses the wake vortex hazard by 
utilizing the Flight Corridor concept proposed by NASA’s 
Rossow [2].  The Flight Corridor is a defined region in 
space wherein the hazardous vortex rolling moment can 
induce no more than 5 degrees of unplanned roll.   
 
2 
TACEC can significantly increase the airport’s arrival (and 
departure) rate by using the Flight Corridors to land 
multiple aircraft on parallel runways, with separation 
distance as close as 750 feet.  Houk [3] has shown that 
runway separation distances of 750 feet require rapid 
reaction times of 2 to 3 seconds to detect and respond to 
blunders. Such minimal separation distance will require a 
very quick reaction time to detect and respond to blunders. 
The quick reaction times as well as the need to provide 
increased capacity in Instrument Meteorological Conditions 
(IMC) are the primary drivers behind auto-land operation. 
The TACEC approach to Flight Corridor/wake hazard 
avoidance also adopts the notion of a “protection zone” 
suggested by R. Bone [4].  The forward boundary of the 
protection zone provides protection from blunder, while the 
aft boundary guards the following aircraft from the wake of 
the lead.  The forward boundary is nominally placed at 750 
feet behind the lead.  The aft boundary prevents the follower 
from drifting more than 30 seconds behind the lead [2].  For 
a B747 operating at near minimum terminal speed of  
150 knots, this equates to an aft boundary at 7600 ft.  The 
nominal position of the following aircraft is defined in the 
middle of the protection-zone, or 4200 ft behind the lead. Of 
course the ability of each aircraft to meet its Required Time 
of Arrival (RTA) will put an error about this nominal 
position, as discussed in Section 3.5. 
3.  INITIAL APPROACH 
Analysis conducted in 2003 using the NASA VAMS 
Airspace Concept Evaluation System (ACES) simulator 
doubled the May 17, 2002 traffic arriving and departing at 
24 candidate closely-spaced parallel runways (CSPR).  This 
analysis indicates that TACEC could achieve a doubling of 
airport capacity, as shown in Figure 1.  
TACEC’s objective is to land/depart multiple aircraft 
“simultaneously” on closely spaced parallel runways. This 
requires the ability to stage the aircraft upon entering the 
Terminal airspace.  While TACEC assumes no control 
authority until aircraft pass the Arrival Meter Fix, 
knowledge of actual and intended trajectory profile is 
available before this event.  TACEC will establish a unique 
track for each flight as it approaches and will maintain this 
track as it passes through the Terminal Airspace.  Automatic 
Dependent Surveillance – Broadcast (ADS-B) is the 
preferred surveillance source and will be used for equipped 
aircraft.  Traffic Information System – Broadcast (TIS-B) will 
provide the trajectory profiles of non-equipped aircraft. 
After track is established, aircraft are evaluated to determine 
if they can be paired with other aircraft and 4D  (lat, lon, alt, 
time) flight paths are generated.  The 4D flight paths are 
calculated in two steps.  The first step determines whether it 
is possible to bring the two aircraft to the final wake vortex

approach meter fix nearly simultaneously, without regard to 
considerations.  Aircraft pairs that do not meet this 
requirement are eliminated from further consideration.  The 
second step determines how the flight paths must be 
modified for wake avoidance. 
Initial Path Calculation, No Wake Avoidance 
The first step begins by attempting to group aircraft which 
have “similar” flight characteristics and arrive at the 
approach meter fix within a specified threshold, nominally 2 
minutes.  The most important flight characteristic 
considered is airspeed, because the two aircraft must enter 
the final approach simultaneously and must also land 
simultaneously. Table 1 shows how aircraft might be 
grouped in this manner. 
Table 1 shows three groups of aircraft that have similar 
flight speeds (compare columns (“Min Speed” and “Max 
TRACON Speed”).  Only aircraft in the same group are 
considered for pairing. 
The next part of the calculation is to determine the aircraft 
flight paths.  We begin by determining the time window that 
can be obtained through varying the speed of each aircraft, 
keeping in mind the fact that we require a two minute 
window as discussed previously.  This calculation requires a 
“minimum speed” and a “maximum speed” for the entire 
group.  Figure 2 shows how to calculate these values.   The 
minimum speed for the group must represent the worst case 
minimum, i.e. the largest of all the aircraft minimum speeds 
in the group.  Similarly, the group maximum represents the 
smallest maximum speed of all the aircraft in the group.

The initial time window is calculated by considering the 
length of the current flight paths used in Chicago O’Hare 
Airport (ORD).  Figure 3 shows the current paths, taken

Procedures” handbook, EC Volume 3, 19 Feb. 2004.

If we consider the shortest flight path (Bradford), its length 
of 45 nautical miles (nmi) only allows a worst-case time 
window of 1.2 minutes.  This falls far short of the required 2 
minutes, so it becomes necessary to add an alternate flight 
path, which is slightly longer (48 nmi).  The two paths taken 
together make it possible to obtain a two-minute window for 
aircraft that arrive at the southwest meter fix. 
The alternate flight path must be chosen so that the time 
windows of the two paths overlap each other.  The total time 
window must also yield the two minute requirement (see 
Figure 4).  The “Direct Path” line segment represents the 
difference between the minimum and maximum aircraft 
traversal times for the direct path.  The length of this 
segment depends upon the length of the direct path, and 
upon the minimum and maximum allowed aircraft speeds.  
Similarly, the “Alternate Path” line segment represents the 
difference between the minimum and maximum traversal 
times for the alternate path.  The overlap mentioned above 
occurs if the minimum time for the alternate path is less than 
the maximum time for the direct path.  The “Total Time 
Window” is the difference between the minimum time for 
the direct path and the maximum time for the alternate path.  
This must be at least two minutes. These are conflicting 
requirements, and it may not be possible to satisfy this for 
all types of aircraft.  If this happens, it may become 
necessary to add a third flight path.

For the other flight paths (Janesville, Knox, Pullman) the 
current path length of 75 nmi or greater can provide the 
required two minute window.  No alternate flight paths are 
needed. 
Wake Avoidance 
The calculated 4D paths from step 1 are unacceptable from 
the standpoint of wake avoidance.  The trailing aircraft 
would fly through the leading aircraft’s wake before it could 
catch up to the leading aircraft. 
 
5 
It is therefore necessary to modify the trailing aircraft’s 
flight path that was calculated in step 1, so that the leading 
aircraft’s wake is avoided.  Figure 5 shows this 
modification.

Figure 5 – Wake Avoidance Calculation 
 
The original flight path of the aircraft is represented by the 
straight line of length “L”.  This is the path to be modified.  
The modification is accomplished by calculating appropriate 
values for “L1” and “a”.  The distance “a” represents the 
horizontal separation between the two aircraft. 
This modification does not appreciably change the overall 
flight path for reasonable values of “a”, such as 0.5 nmi [2]. 
This is shown in Table 2, where the sum “L1 + L2” is 
calculated.  The result is only slightly longer than the 
original length of 45 nmi.  It is therefore anticipated that the 
small perturbation introduced by this path modification can 
easily be compensated for by adjusting the aircraft speeds.

The flight paths calculated above are then uplinked using a 
data link discussed in Section 3.4 to the aircraft, and the 
aircraft’s flight management system will follow the path 
requested (See Figure 6).  Since multiple aircraft are flying 
interrelated flight paths with variable error performance and 
with variable and unpredictable wind or other flight 
conditions, the waypoints not yet flown through may well 
need to be updated.  The duration of this flight regime, in 
initial approach, is approximately 20 minutes.  Therefore a 
waypoint will be passed approximately every one to three 
minutes.  Based upon initial analysis, it appears the error 
budget will not be exceeded if the waypoints are updated 
approximately every minute.  If upon further analysis, 
additional waypoints are needed minor waypoints could be 
defined that could be as close as at 20 second intervals.

Arrivals at Different Meter Fixes 
The discussion so far has centered upon pairing aircraft that 
arrive at the same TRACON boundary meter fix.  When 
aircraft arrive at different meter fixes, the problem is 
different because of the (potential) large difference in flight 
path lengths.  For example, flights that arrive at southwest 
meter fix at ORD (Bradford) have only 45 nmi travel 
distance to the final approach meter fix, whereas flights 
arriving at southeast meter fix (Janesville) need to travel 75 
nmi to reach the same final approach point. 
This is handled by calculating an offset time “toff“ which 
represents the difference between the minimum times 
required for the aircraft to fly each path.  This offset is 
depicted in Figure 7. The line segments labeled “Direct 
Path’ and “Alternate Path” are the same as shown in Figure 
4.  The “SE Meter Fix” line represents the minimum and 
maximum times to traverse the path from the SE meter fix 
to the final approach fix.  This path is much longer than the 
other two so there is no overlap with those paths.  The offset 
time, toff is the difference between the SE meter fix 
minimum time and the direct path minimum time.

Figure 7 – Time Offset for Arrivals at Different Meter 
Fixes 
Any aircraft that arrives at the southeast meter fix at time t 
can be paired with an aircraft of the same group that arrives 
at the southwest meter fix at time winoff ttt ±+ , where twin 
is the required two minute window.  Note that the case 
where both aircraft arrive at the same meter fix is simply a 
sub-case of this, where toff is equal to zero. 
Since this process will use a data link to reach the aircraft 
that are arriving and departing, one concern is whether the 
aircraft can or will be equipped with the necessary avionics.  
One approach that has been defined by the International 
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) and the certification of 
the necessary avionics supported by the FAA is VHF Data 
Link Mode 3 (VDL Mode3). We have evaluated in [5] 
whether a system having characteristics similar to VDL  
Mode 3 could support this application.  The essential 
features of VDL Mode 3 are the time division multiple 
access protocol providing four subchannels for user 
information and a separate management channel.  The 
subchannels can be used in several modes.  For analysis we 
selected a mode that provides two separate user groups each 
having a shared voice and data network all transmitted on 
one 25 kHz bandwidth frequency.  Other similar time 
division link level protocols have been defined and provide 
similar capabilities. 
VDL Mode 3 at the link layer is a ground station controlled 
process.  The link layer is managed by the ground station 
accepting requests for data transfer from both mobile users 
and the ground with 4 levels of priority.  The ground system 
schedules the use of each data burst and assigns it to either 
the ground or a specific mobile user.  However, it must be 
recognized that the ground system has the ultimate power to 
decide who gets to send what data.  This allows the ground 
station to schedule waypoint position updates as necessary 
and with a maximum delay to the next opportunity of 120 
msec.  There is also a built-in acknowledgement scheme at 
the link level where the mobile user acknowledges correct 
reception of a message transfer in a separate sub-channel.   
Within one VDL Mode 3 2V2D user group consisting of 1 
voice and 1 data slot with up to 120 users, there is an 
opportunity for the ground system to send up to 62 bytes of 
information addressed to any one mobile user every 120 
msec and one voice conversation between the approach 
controller providing a human monitor of the situation and 
the pilots in the approach pattern.  Using 9 bytes per 
waypoint as established in [5].  The 62 bytes provide for the 
next 6 major waypoints to be sent to the aircraft.  These 6 
waypoints could define the aircraft position for the next 6 
minutes or a waypoint every minute of flight.  Or if 
appropriate a much shorter interval can be used.  For 
instance, the next 6 waypoints could be provided for 20 
second intervals with a projection into the future of 2 
minutes.  With an update rate of 1 per minute, up to 500 
updates can be transmitted using the full capacity of the 
network.  Using the full addressable capacity of a VDL 
Mode 3 user group, recently upgraded by the RTCA Special 
Committee 172 in the draft of a B version of DO-224A [4] 
to 120 users in a single 2V2D group (or 240 per frequency), 
sending one uplink burst for each of 120 aircraft once per 
minute would use 24% of the available capacity of the 
network.  This leaves a reasonable capacity for other 
possible uses, such as broadcast of current weather 
conditions and general alerts.  With a total capacity of 600 
airport operations/hour and a 20 minute approach period for 
each aircraft, an average capacity of 200 aircraft at any time 
is necessary.  This can be achieved using both user groups 
available on one VDL Mode 3 frequency, which provides a 
total capacity of up to 240 users with a 20% margin for 
imbalance in arrivals vs. departures or peaking of traffic.  
Transition to Final Approach  
During initial approach the aircraft are maneuvered to 
deliver the following aircraft within the protection-zone 
behind the lead.  During this phase, each aircraft follows its 
own 4D flight path, therefore each is affected 
 
7 
independently by RTA errors.  RTA flight trials conducted 
with a Boeing 737 in the spring of 2001 [6] have shown that 
RTA errors at waypoints at the top of the Standard Arrival 
procedures had a error of 4.8 seconds (1-sigma), and the 
error increased to 12.7 seconds (1-sigma) at the runway 
threshold.  Final approach occurs approximately half way 
between these two end-points, so the error lies somewhere 
in the middle.  If the aircraft remain independently 
controlled during final approach the error can be assumed to 
be an average or 8.75 seconds (1-sigma).  This equates to a 
position error of about 2400 ft.  In this case the follower 
could overtake the leader as notionally depicted in Figure 8.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 8 - Position Error with Independent Control 
During Initial and Final Approach 
An alternate approach would be control of the follower 
relative to the leader after the pair begins final approach.  
The effective RTA error would be reduced to about 6.7 
seconds (1-sigma).  This produces a position error of about 
1900 ft, and in this case the follower remains behind the 
lead by at least 400 ft as depicted in Figure 9.

4.  FINAL APPROACH OVERVIEW 
The aircraft transitions into Final Approach, entering the 
TACEC Flight Corridors, approximately four minutes from 
the airport.  Close-control during Final Approach is 
achieved by using differential GPS landing aids in 
conjunction with auto-land avionics.  This will require a 
Total System Error (TSE) smaller than available today.  
TSE is composed of Navigation Sensor Error (NSE) and 
Flight Technical Error (FTE), and defines how well an 
aircraft can accurately follow a pre-defined path in the sky.  
Differential GPS systems such as the Wide Augmentation 
System (WAAS) and the Local Area Augmentation System 
(LAAS) significantly reduce NSE compared to radar sensors 
such as Instrument Landing System (ILS).   However, 
Hammer [7] and Houk [8] have shown that flight 
management systems and cock-pit displays in today’s fleet 
preclude the system from taking advantage of the reduced 
NSE.  Due to the existing avionics, the system even with 
WAAS/LAAS, produces a TSE roughly equivalent to 
existing ILS. 
The promise of improving airport capacity by utilizing IMC 
approaches onto closely spaced parallel runways can not be 
attained without a change to the avionics.  Since TACEC 
uses auto-land, modifying the avionics to include tunnel-in-
the sky displays may not be required. Instead, a lower-cost 
and relatively simple tuning of the autopilot interface may 
suffice.  We plan to investigate this issue in the near future, 
possibly through the use of hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) 
simulations. 
Final Approach Data Link 
The Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) includes an 
internal data link with capacity to support close control of 
the aircraft.  LAAS operates on a VHF broadcast data link 
known as VDB. VDB is a TDMA based scheme with 28.4 
Kbps application data.  While the datalink bandwidth allows 
for 95 unique Final Approach Segment (FAS) blocks, the 
actual number is limited to 48 by the number of unique 
Reference Path Data Selector (RPDS codes).  Thus, LAAS 
can support up to 48 aircraft during Final Approach/Initial 
Departure.  The differential corrections are uplinked in Type 
1 messages at 2Hz.  The differential reference points and 
FAS are uplinked in Type 2 and 4 messages, respectively, 
every 10 seconds.  The LAAS VDB coverage is depicted in 
Figure 10. 
Alternative approaches are also being considered should 
LAAS not be available.  Under these conditions the lead 
aircraft would use whatever the approved approach 
procedure is for the weather conditions.  The trailing aircraft 
would position itself with reference to the lead aircraft using 
its ADS-B data.  While ADS-B may not provide extremely 
accurate absolute position, if both aircraft are navigating in 
the same area using the same augmentation from either 
LAAS or WAAS the relative positions will be very

accurate.  As was pointed out in earlier papers by Houk [3] 
under these conditions the potential for the lead aircraft to 
blunder into the following aircraft’s flight path is the major 
concern.  Knowledge of the roll and roll-rate of the lead 
aircraft appears to be the most sensitive indicator of a turn 
toward the follower.  As few as two bits of information 
indicating the following 4 states might be sufficient: 
1. Rolling away 
2. Normal level flight 
3. Moderate roll toward following 
4. Severe roll toward following. 
There does not appear to be space within the existing ADS-
B message structure to support this information transfer, but 
a simple direct data link between the aircraft might be the 
solution.  As these two aircraft are well separated from all 
other aircraft and the ground an adaptation of the same data 
links used or proposed for use on the surface might be 
appropriate. 
5.  TRAFFIC LOADING  
Grouping aircraft improves performance, but the spacing 
between groups onto and off of the same runway must 
adhere to today’s wake vortex separation requirements.  For 
arrivals, assuming a typical terminal airspace velocity of 
140 knots, a group of Large aircraft would need to follow 
another Large group by 1:04, while a Large group following 
a Heavy group would require a spacing of 2:08.  Assuming 
a worst case (with respect to communication loading) of one 
minute separation between arriving groups, with two aircraft 
per group, the maximum number of arrivals per hour onto 
one set of parallel runways would be 120 arrivals/hour.  For 
departures, according to FAA 7110.65M the Category III 
groups must be separated by 6000 ft, or approximately  
40 seconds.  When the group is taking off behind a heavy jet 
or B757 the groups must be separated by 2 minutes. Again 
we will use the worst case assumption of 40 seconds for 
communication loading. With two aircraft per group, the 
maximum number of departures per hour off of one set of 
parallel runways would be 180 departures/hour.  The 120 
arrivals/hour and 180 departures/hour represent the busiest 
hours, however averaged throughout the day the number of 
arrivals and departures will even out.  An airport can be 
equipped with multiple sets of closely spaced runways, 
some used exclusively for arrivals and others for departures.  
Assume two sets are dedicated to arrivals with each 
handling 120 arrivals/hour.  Two other sets will each handle 
180 departures/hour. The total airport operations could 
therefore be 600 operations/hour. This is slightly higher 
than the 546 operations/hour that would be required at DFW 
if its capacity were to double and so is a reasonable worst-
case across the NAS.   The number of aircraft controlled by 
TACEC, during a 20 minute Initial Approach mode, will be 
200 (80 arriving and 120 departing).  As was noted above, 
up to 120 aircraft can be handled at any one time supporting 
the two 180 departure operations/hour runway pairs with a 
20 minute departure window. 
There will be 40 aircraft during the four minute Final 
Approach/Initial Departure, bringing the total number of 
aircraft controlled in a 24 minute TACEC Terminal 
Airspace to 240.  An additional 100 aircraft in the terminal 
area representing GA or otherwise non-equipped are 
included in the link analysis.

Communication Loading 
In addition to flight plans, TACEC also requires that 
surveillance data be transmitted between the ground and 
aircraft.  ADS-B will provide surveillance of equipped 
aircraft, those under TACEC control.  Surveillance of non-
equipped aircraft will be available via TIS-B to the ground 
based operational algorithms and TACEC aircraft for pilot 
situational awareness.  Accurate knowledge of the wind 
field is required by the ground based operational algorithms, 
and this information will be available at the ground station 
through the Integrated Terminal Weather System (ITWS) 
Gridded Winds Product – Terminal Winds. TACEC also 
allows for transmission of voice, to be carried on VDL 
Mode-3 using the 2V/2D mode.  The previous 
communication loading analysis [5] indicate that 4D Flight 
Plan message utilize approximate 30% of the VDL Mode 3 
data link.    The other links are also significantly below their 
limits. 
6.  CONCLUSION 
This paper has demonstrated that the TACEC approach to 
Terminal Area traffic flow can provide a significant 
improvement to the arrival and departure capacity of the 
terminal area.  Implementation will require that avionics be 
modified in order to take advantage of the increased 
navigation accuracy available through WAAS/LAAS.  A 
low-cost approach to this modification is under 
investigation. TACEC also requires a digital 
communications infrastructure much of which is anticipated 
to be in operation, especially on the aircraft, when TACEC 
would be implemented.  If VDL Mode 3 is not 
implemented, a similar system with similar capabilities is 
anticipated.
