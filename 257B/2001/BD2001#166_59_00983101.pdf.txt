Abstract 
In this paper, neural network technique is applied to a system named NEUCOMS that is designed for condition monitoring 
of power transformers. Through employing paired neural networks, NEUCOMS has the ability of analyzing data of 
electrical inspections as well as data of the chromatogram of oil-dissolved gases. It utilizes redundant input attributes to 
speed the training and reduce the size of the neural networks. Moreover, it exploits fuzzy techniques to preprocess the 
input data so that features with small values will not be blocked off by features with big values. Experiments show that 
NEUCOMS works well in real-world situations. 
Keywords Neural networks, power transformers, condition monitoring. 
1. Introduction 
Condition monitoring is very important in guaranteeing the safe running of power transformers. With condition 
monitoring, unexpected failures can be avoided through the possession of quality information relating to the online 
condition of the power transformers and the consequent ability to identify faults or problems while still in the incipient 
phases of development. Moreover, with condition monitoring, maintenance of power transformers can be condition based 
rather than periodically based. Since the physical processes of failures have not been clearly recognized at present, the 
monitors usually set up mappings between the faults and their appearances and then diagnose the faults with pattern 
recognition techniques. As an important pattern recognition technique with good nonlinear processing ability, neural 
networks have recently been extensively used in this area [ 1,2,9, 111. 
In this paper, a neural networks based power transformer condition monitoring system named NEUCOMS (NEUral 
Condition Monitoring System) is presented. NEUCOMS utilizes a specific paired neural network architecture comprising 
an online neural network and an offline neural network, which enables it deal with data of electrical inspections as well 
as that of the chromatogram of oil-dissolved gases. It employs redundant input attributes to accelerate the training speed 
and reduce the number of hidden units of the neural networks. Moreover, it exploits fuzzy techniques to preprocess the 
primitive input data so that important features with relatively small values will not be blqcked off by features with 
relatively big values. Experiments show that the monitoring effect of NEUCOMS is close to that of experienced human 
experts, and it is appreciated by users in real-world Wouts. 
2. Paired neural networks 
In most neural networks based condition monitoring systems, only the data of the chromatogram of oil-dissolved gases is 
processed while the data of electrical inspections is seldom used [5 ] .  The reason lies in the diversity, the high cost, and 
the temporal relationships of electrical inspections. On one hand, there are accurate symbolic criteria [4] in analyzing the 
0-7803-70 10-4/01/$10.00Q2001 IEEE.

data of the chromatogram of oil-dissolved gases so that utilizing neural networks to deal with only gas data has not well 
exerted the function of neural techniques. On the other hand, the data of electrical inspections is very useful in locating 
some faults that can not be identified by the analysis of gas data. Therefore building neural networks based systems that 
have the ability of dealing with data of electrical inspections as well as data of the chromatogram of oil-dissolved gases is 
of benefit to condition monitoring of power transformers. 
The temporal relationships of electrical inspections lie in the orders of different inspections, that is, whether an 
inspection B is required in condition monitoring is determined by the result of an inspection A. For example, the 
imuZation resistance need not be measured if other inspections show that the power transformer is well running. If it is 
measured precede other electrical inspections, unnecessary cost is required because measuring the insUation msktance 
requires terminating the power supply. Such kind of logic orders of electrical inspections is the origin of their temporal 
relationships, and those temporal relationships lead to the result that it is almost impossible to attain all the data of 
electrical inspections at a same time without unnecessary cost. However, neural networks claim that all the input data 
should be provided before the training begins. Therefore an obstacle appears in hindering the data of electrical 
inspections from acting as inputs to the neural networks. 
In order to get across the obstacle, NEUCOMS adopts paired neural networks based on the fault set and the fault 
attribute set [6] .  At first, some important online electrical inspections are selected to constitute the online fault attribute 
set along with the analysis of the chromatogram of oil-dissolved gases. The faults that can be identified by the online 
fault attribute set constitute the online fault set. Then, an online monitoring neural network is built by regarding the 
online fault attribute set and the online fault set as the input and output attribute sets respectively. On the other hand, 
some important offline electrical inspections are selected to constitute another fault attribute set, i.e. the offline fault 
attribute set, along with both the analysis of the chromatogram of oil-dissolved gases and those selected online electrical 
inspections. The faults that can be identified by the offline fault attribute set constitute the offline fault set. Then an 
offline monitoring neural network is built by regarding the offline fault attribute set and the offline fault set as the input 
and output attribute sets respectively. 
Both the online and the offline neural networks are trained so that the former one is applicable when power supply is 
not terminated while the latter one is applicable when power supply is terminated. As for the online neural network, since 
the cost of evaluating its input attributes is not high, i.e. does not require terminating the power supply, its input dab can 
be collected at a same time. As for the offline neural network, the cost of evaluating its input attributes is high because 
some electrical inspections require terminating the power supply. However, its input data can be attained at a same time 
when the power transformer is in periodic termination and examine, or when the operators actively terminate the power 
transformer as they suspect that there are serious hidden troubles. Moreover, since the online fault set and the online fault 
attribute set are respectively proper subsets of the oMine fault set and the offline fault attribute set, the online neural 
network is also applicable when the offline neural network is applicable. Therefore the consultation of multiple experts 
can be simulated in verifying the reasoning result of a neural network against that of the other neural network. 
3. Redundant input attributes 
At present treble-ratio-rule [4] is the most authoritative criterion in China in analyzing the chromatogram of oil-dissolved 
gases. Treble-ratio-rule computes the ratios, including CH, / H,, CzH2 I C2H4, and CzH4 / C,H,, of the volumes of H2, CH,, 
C,H,, C,H,, and C,H, in the oil-dissolved gas, and then performs condition monitoring according to some empirical rules. 
In NEUCOMS the volumes of those five kinds of gases are included as inputs to both the online and the offline neural 
networks. Moreover, since the volumes of totaZhydmcarrbon (CH4+ c2H,+CzH4+C,H,, abbr. C1+ C2), CO, and CO2 are 
helpful in locating the faults, they are also included as inputs to both the online and the offline neural networks. 
As for the electrical inspections, uZtmsonic memure (abbr. UL), arbnomuZsound(abbr. AS), and cumnt f im inn 
469 
core fo ea& (abbr. CE) are included as inputs to the online neural network; dixct cumnr resbfance (abbr. DR) and inn 
core inmhfion mz3tance (abbr. IR) along with those three inspections used for the online neural network are included as 
inputs to the offline neural network. 
Note that fotd hydmmr8on is a redundant attribute because it does not provide any information that cannot be 
derived fkom the attributes CH4, C2H6, C2H4, and C2H2. Therefore tota/hy&can5on can be automatically learned by the 
neural networks through their implicitly constructive learning [3], However, explicitly utilizing such a helpful redundant 
attribute as input can not only increase the learning ability of the neural networks but also reduce the number of hidden 
units required in achieving good generalization ability [3]. So, NEUCOMS also includes the ratios of CH, / H,, C2Hz / CzH4, 
and C2H, / GH, as inputs to both the online and the offline neural networks. 
4. Fuzzy preprocessing 
In NEUCOMS there are great differences in the value ranges of the input attributes. For example, the value of the attribute 
CO2 is usually bigger than 1,000 while the value of the attribute CH, / H2 is usually between 0 and 1. If the primitive data 
is directly input to the neural networks, the features with relatively small values will be blocked off by those with 
relatively big values. A solution is to map the value ranges of different attributes to a same interval, e.g. [O, 11. 
It is easy to transform all the primitive input data to the interval [0, 11 through dividing them by their corresponding 
maximum values. However, such a linear mapping may drop some important characteristics of the original probabilistic 
distribution. In order to deal with such a problem, NEUCOMS introduces fuzzy techniques. Some uffenfion vahm are 
provided by experienced power transformer experts, which is shown in Table 1 where the unit of gases, CE, and IR are 
respectively ppm, mA, and &.

O.H 100 50 100 100 3 300 5,000 150 20 1,500 
Based on those attention values, the membership grades of the primitive values of the input attributes against their 
corresponding attention values are computed according to a membership function, and then the membership grades act as 
the inputs to the neural networks instead of the primitive data. The membership function used in NEUCOMS is Sigmoid 
function shown in Eq.(l), where x denotes the primitive data while x, denotes its corresponding attention value. 
Moreover, in NEUCOMS the values of binary attributes are mapped to 0.1 and 0.9, and the values of ternary attributes 
are mapped to 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9. Those mappings can speed the converging of the neural networks [lo]. Experiments 
show that those preprocessing techniques are not only helpful in reducing training time of the neural networks but also 
useful in endowing the trained neural networks with strong generalization ability. 
5. Experiments 
NEUCOMS is experimented on a data set comprising 704 instances, among which 528 instances are used as training set 
while the rest 176 instances are used as test set. The data set is provided by the Institute of Electric Science of Shandong 
Province, P.R.China. All the instances in the data set are collected fiom power transformers in use. 
Both the online and the offline neural networks are trained with SuperSAB algorithm [8], which is one of the fastest 
variations of backpropagation. Tollenaere [8] reported that it is 10 - 100 times faster than standard BP [7]. The 
‘470 
parameters of SupersAB are set to values recommended by Wasserman [lo], i.e. the weight-increasing factor qup is set to 
1.05, the weight-reducing factor qdJubrwn, is set to 0.2, and the upper ground of the maximum step of the kth weight ?,$is set 
to 10. 
Experimental results show that the test set accuracy of the online Table 2 Abbreviations used in Table 2
