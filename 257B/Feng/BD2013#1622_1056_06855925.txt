 Abstract—In the last years, the emergence of big data led
 scientists from diverse disciplines toward the study of the laws
 underlying human mobility. Although these recent discoveries
 have shed light on very interesting and fascinating aspects about
 people movements, they are generally focused on global and
 general mobility patterns. For this reason, they do not necessarily
 capture phenomena related to specific types of mobility, such as
 mobility by car, by public transportations means, by foot and so
 on. In this work, we aim to compare general human mobility with
 mobility expressed by a specific conveyance, trying to address
 the following question: What are the differences between general
 mobility and mobility by car? To answer this question, we present
 the results of an analysis performed on a big mobile phone dataset
 and on a GPS dataset storing information about car travels in
 Italy.
 I. INTRODUCTION
 In the last few years, the emergence of big data led scien-
 tists from diverse disciplines toward the study of human mo-
 bility, helping to discover and understand the hidden patterns
 in the trajectories people follow during their daily life. Such
 a social microscope showed that traditional mobility models
 adapted from the observation of particles or animals (such
 as Brownian motion and Le´vy-flights) [1], [2] and recently
 from the observation of dollar bills [5], are not suitable to
 describe people’s movements. Indeed, at a global scale humans
 are characterized by a huge heterogeneity, since a power law
 was observed in the distribution of the characteristic distance
 traveled by users [3], [4]. Despite the observed heterogeneity in
 people’s movements, through the observation of past mobility
 history the whereabouts of most individuals can be predicted
 with a very high accuracy, higher than 80% [6], [7].
 These recent discoveries have undoubtedly shed light on
 very interesting and fascinating aspects about human mobility.
 However, they are generally focused on global and general
 mobility patterns: through the analysis of GSM and other types
 of data describing travels with different transportation means,
 researchers revealed that our movements are not random, but
 follow their own laws. Since such laws are very general, they
 do not necessarily capture phenomena related to specific types
 of mobility. To clarify this point, let us consider movements by
 bike. Bikes are convenient and efficient transportation means
 to use within a city, but they are not suitable to cover very
 large distances. For this reason, while the accuracy in the
 predictability of bikers could not differ so much from the
 general pattern, the variability with respect to the characteristic
 traveled distance is presumably much lower, leading to a
 different mobility pattern.
 The aim of this paper is to compare general mobility
 with mobility by car, trying to answer the following question:
 What are the differences between general mobility patterns and
 patterns of car travel? To address this question, we exploit a big
 mobile phone dataset collected by a European mobile phone
 carrier and a GPS dataset consisting of the detailed spatio-
 temporal trajectories of travels performed by cars in Italy. By
 exploiting these data, we show the difference between global
 mobility and mobility by car in two important aspects: the
 distribution of radius of gyration and the distribution of time
 spent in the visited locations.
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section II de-
 scribes the dataset and highlights the main difference between
 GSM and GPS data. Section III briefly describes the individual
 mobility measures we used to unveil the patterns, while
 Section IV presents a comparison between GSM and GPS
 patterns. Finally, Section V concludes the paper, providing
 some conclusions.
 II. DATA DESCRIPTION: GSM VS GPS
 Mobile phones are nowadays very common technological
 devices offering a good proxy to capture individual trajectories.
 Indeed, each time a user makes a call the carrier records the
 tower that communicates with the phone, effectively pinpoint-
 ing users’ location. Unfortunately, this information is not ter-
 ribly accurate because an individual could be anywhere within
 the tower’s reception area, which can span tens of square
 kilometers. Furthermore, the location is usually recorded only
 when a person uses her phone, providing little information
 about the whereabouts between calls. Since call patterns are
 bursty [8], for most of the time the actual position of a user
 is unknown.
 In the current study, we exploit a GSM dataset collected by
 a European mobile phone carrier for billing and operational
 purposes. It contains temporal (date and time) and spatial (the
 cell phone tower’s coordinates) information of all calls and
 text messages sent by 3 million costumers1. Table I shows an

example of phone records. In order to select the most reliable
 users for our purpose, we restricted our period of observation
 to three months and applied some filters to the data. For each
 user, we discarded locations visited only once during the entire
 period of observation, and those with a number of calls less
 than 0.05% of the total2. Then, from the resulting dataset we
 deleted all users who visited only a single location, and those
 with a call frequency less than twelve calls per day on average
 during the period of observation. The filtering phase resulted
 in a final dataset of 67, 000 active users.

 Unlike GSM data, GPS traces provide high resolution
 location data, storing the geodetic coordinates with an average
 sampling rate of few seconds. Even though these features
 are ideal in making a refined statistical analysis of human
 mobility patterns, relatively few works in literature are based
 on GPS data, mainly due to the difficulty to obtain complete
 traces covering movements along the whole day. In this work,
 we have access to a GPS dataset that stores information of
 approximately 9.8 Million different car travels from 159, 000
 cars tracked during one month (May 2011) in an area of
 250km?250km in central Italy. The GPS traces are collected
 by Octo Telematics Italia Srl3, a company that provides a data
 collection service for insurance companies. Since GPS data
 do not provide explicit information about visited locations, we
 assigned each origin and destination point of the travels to
 the corresponding Italian census cell, according to information
 provided by the Italian National Institute of Statistics4. After
 such aggregation, many users are found to have only one
 visited location. We discarded them and took into account
 only those users with the most frequent location (most likely
 their home or work) inside the region of Tuscany. These
 filtering operations produced a dataset of 46, 121 users, where
 a travel is described by a timestamp and a pair of coordinates
 corresponding to the centroids of the origin and destination
 cells of the travel (Table II).

 Table III summarizes a few properties of the two datasets
 described above. It is worth noting that GPS data provide us
 information about displacements performed by car only. For
 this reason, we have a partial knowledge about the whole
 mobility of individuals. Conversely, GSM data may provide
 information about travels made using all transportation means,
 although they are actually recorded only when a user calls
 before and after the trip.
 2this means that a location i is deleted if ni/N < 0.005, where ni is the
 number of calls performed in the tower i, and N the total number of calls
 performed by the user.

 III. MOBILITY MEASURES
 In order to explore the statistical properties of the mobility
 patterns, for each user we computed several individual mobility
 measures.
 The center of mass rcm of a user represents the pivot of her
 individual mobility. Mathematically, it is a two-dimensional
 vector representing the weighted mean of the visited locations:
 rcm =
 1
 W
 L∑
 i=1
 wiri (1)
 where L is the total number of distinct towers/cells visited
 by the user/car; ri is a two-dimensional vector representing
 the geographic coordinates of tower/cell i; wi is the weight
 assigned to location i; and W the sum of the weights over all
 locations. Depending on the measure considered to evaluate
 the weight of a location, two different centers of mass can be
 defined. The frequency-based center of mass weights locations
 according to their visitation frequency, hence wi is the number
 of calls/arrivals performed in location i. In the time-based
 center of mass we take wi as the total time spent by the user
 in location i.
 Another interesting measure of an individual’s central position
 is the most frequent location L1, i.e. the location where she can
 be located with the highest probability, which is most likely
 the home or work place. Such measure can be computed in a
 very straightforward way by simply taking the tower/cell from
 which the user performs the highest number of calls/arrivals.
 The radius of gyration of a user [3], [4] is a mobility
 measure representing the characteristic distance traveled by
 each individual. It is a concept borrowed from physics, defined
 as the root mean square of the weighted sum of all locations’
 distances from the center of mass:
 rg =
 √√√√ 1
 W
 L∑
 i=1
 wi(ri ? rcm)2 (2)
 where rcm is the vector of coordinates representing the center
 of mass. We computed two types of radius of gyration: i) rg
 with respect to the frequency-based center of mass, i.e. wi is
 the total number of calls/arrivals in i; ii) rg with respect to the
 time-based center of mass, i.e. wi is the total time spent in i.
 IV. RESULTS
 In this section, we compare the patterns found on the two
 datasets, highlighting the main differences between general
 mobility and mobility by car.
 The first aspect we investigated is the difference between the
 frequency-based radius of gyration and the time-based one.
 In other words, how does the choice of locations’ weight
 influence the value of the radius of gyration? Figure 1 shows
 the scatter plots of frequency-rg versus time-rg , for GSM
 (left) and GPS (center) users. For a better understanding of

 the underlying correlation, also error bars are drawn, with bin
 size of 50km (GSM) and 5km (GPS). At a first glance, in
 both cases the measures seem to be correlated, as expected.
 However, from a closer examination an interesting difference
 emerges: while in the GSM case the mean of the error bars
 tends to be biased toward the time-rg , in GPS data the mean
 frequency-rg tends to be higher. One possible interpretation of
 the phenomenon is that car visitation frequency of locations
 distant from the center of mass is higher, leading to a bigger
 characteristic traveled distance.
 Figure 2 (left) shows the distributions of frequency- and time-
 based radii of gyration computed on the GSM dataset. There
 is no significant difference between the two curves, which
 practically coincide. Conversely, a sharp difference clearly
 emerges from the distributions of radii in the GPS case (Figure
 2, right). Indeed, the time-based distribution is shifted towards
 shorter radii, and peaks at 2km instead of 5km. This aspect
 confirms the prominent role of frequency with respect to time
 observed in Figure 1 (center), suggesting that cars are usually
 parked for a long time in locations close to the center of mass
 (like home and work locations). This effect is absent in GSM
 data because people can continue their call activity even while
 being stationary. Another difference we can notice is that while
 the GSM curves decrease over the entire range, GPS radii show
 a growing value up to ≈2km. This is presumably due to the
 tendency of covering those small distances by foot, bike, or
 bus, resulting in a lower probability to find such travels in the
 GPS dataset.
 To test at what extent the differences in the distribution of
 rg are due by the geographic scale (GSM data refers to a
 whole country, while GPS to a single region), we computed the
 rg distribution of those GSM users having the most frequent
 location in a region of the country of a size and population
 comparable to Tuscany. In the computation of the radius, only
 the locations within the region are taken into account. As
 Figure 2 (right) shows, the distribution of the radius does not
 change significantly, suggesting that the shape of the curves,
 and their slopes, are rather independent from the scale and are
 related to the portion of mobility they represent.
 The time spent across the visited locations is another inter-
 esting mobility aspect it is worth investigating. Figure 3 (left)
 shows the GSM distribution of time spent for the five most
 frequent locations L1, . . . , L5. As we can see, the time spent
 is clearly unbalanced in favor of the most important location
 L1. This is reasonable, because the most frequent location
 usually corresponds to user’s home or work place, which are
 the locations where an individual spends most of the time.
 The plot also suggests that time is proportional to frequency:
 the more a user visit a location, the more time she spends
 there. Such phenomenon is confirmed by Figure 4, where the
 correlation, though not perfectly linear, is evident.
 The same pattern is also observed on GPS data, although the
 difference between L1 and the other locations is less sharp
 (Figure 3, right). It is worth to note that in both plots, L1
 intersects the other curves approximately at the same points.
 This is very interesting because, independently from the geo-
 graphical scale and from the portion of mobility considered,
 beyond a certain fraction of time is much more likely for a
 user to be located in the L1 than all the other locations.

 V. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
 Our data-driven analysis showed the difference between
 general mobility and mobility by car regarding two main
 aspects: the distribution of radius of gyration and the distri-
 bution of time spent in the visited locations. We discovered
 that, regardless the geographic scale, the shape of the rg
 distribution is different since mobility by car tends to poorly
 cover displacements within small distances. However, in both
 cases the distribution of time spent in visited locations present
 a clear dominance by the most frequent location L1, with such
 dominance more pronounced in the GSM dataset. Moreover,
 the L1 curve intersects the others approximatively at the same
 points in both cases, hinting the presence of a general pattern
 underlying the phenomenon.
