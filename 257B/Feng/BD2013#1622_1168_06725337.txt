Abstract—The rapid growth of the Internet has brought with 
it an exponential increase in the type and frequency of cyber 
attacks. Many well-known cybersecurity solutions are in place to 
counteract these attacks. However, the generation of Big Data 
over computer networks is rapidly rendering these traditional 
solutions obsolete. To cater for this problem, corporate research 
is now focusing on Security Analytics, i.e., the application of Big 
Data Analytics techniques to cybersecurity. Analytics can assist 
network managers particularly in the monitoring and 
surveillance of real-time network streams and real-time detection 
of both malicious and suspicious (outlying) patterns. Such a 
behavior is envisioned to encompass and enhance all traditional 
security techniques. This paper presents a comprehensive survey 
on the state of the art of Security Analytics, i.e., its description, 
technology, trends, and tools. It hence aims to convince the 
reader of the imminent application of analytics as an 
unparalleled cybersecurity solution in the near future.  
Keywords—cybersecurity; big data analytics; security analytics; 
survey; real-time; suspicion; fraud; outliers; network streams 
I.  BACKGROUND AND MOTIVATION 
The internet is a global network of interconnected systems 
which serves billions of users worldwide. Its popularity and 
rapid growth have come at an expensive cost, i.e., loss of 
information and resources due to cyber threats and attacks. The 
first cyber crime was reported in 2000 and infected almost 45 
million internet users [1].  Over the few past years cyber-
 crimes have increased rapidly with cyber criminals 
continuously exploring new ways to circumvent security 
solutions to get illegal access to computer systems and 
networks. Some important cyber attacks are as follows: 
• Spamming: Spamming is sending unsolicited bulk 
messages to multiple recipients [2]. By 2015, the 
spam volume is forecasted to be 95% of all email 
traffic [3]. Munging, access filtering and content 
filtering are important anti-spam techniques. Munging 
makes email addresses unusable for spammers, e.g., 
abc@gmail.com munges as “abc at gmail dot com”. 
Access filtering detects spam based on IP and email 
addresses while content filtering recognizes pre-
 defined text patters in emails to detect spam. 
• Search Poisoning: Search poisoning is the dishonest 
use of Search Engine Optimization techniques to 
falsely improving the ranking of a webpage [4]. 
Typically, frequent search keywords are used to 
illegally direct users towards short-lived websites. The 
first poisoning case was reported in 2007 [5], 
followed by many others.  
• Botnets: Botnets are networks of malware-infected 
compromised computers managed by an adversary 
[6]. Attackers use bot software equipped with 
integrated command and control system to control 
these zombies (bots) and group them into a network 
called the bot net [7].  
• Denial of Service (DoS): A DoS attack makes a 
system or any other network resource inaccessible to 
its intended users.  It is launched by a large number of 
distributed hosts, e.g., bot net. Many defensive 
techniques such as intrusion detection systems, puzzle 
solution, firewalls etc. have been developed to prevent 
DoS attacks [8]. 
• Phishing: Phishing fraudulently acquires confidential 
user data by mimicking e-communication [9], mainly 
through email and web spoofing [10]. In email 
spoofing, fraudulent emails direct users to fraudulent 
web pages which lure to enter confidential data. In 
web spoofing, fraudulent websites imitate legitimate 
web pages to deceive users into entering data. Many 
anti-phishing solutions are in corporate use to 
counteract this threat. 
• Malware: Malware is software programmed to 
perform and propagate malicious activities, e.g., 
viruses, worms and Trojans. Viruses require human 
intervention for propagation, worms are self-
 propagating, while Trojans are non-self-replicating. 
Damage from malware includes corruption of data or 
operating system, installation of spyware, stealing 
personal credentials or hard disk space etc.   
• Website Threats: Website threats refer to attackers 
exploiting vulnerabilities in legitimate website, 
infecting them and indirectly attacking visitors of 
2013 2nd National Conference on Information Assurance (NCIA)
 978-1-4799-1288-9/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 129
these sites. SQL injections, malicious ads, search 
result redirection are the few techniques which are 
used to infect the legitimate sites [11].  
The extensive damage caused by these cyber attacks has lead to 
the design and implementation of cybersecurity systems. 
Cybersecurity refers to the techniques, processes and 
methodologies concerned with thwarting illegal or dishonest 
cyber attacks in order to protect one or more computers on any 
type of network from any type of damage [12]. The important 
goals of cybersecurity are: 1) securely obtain and share 
information for accurate decision-making, 2) find and deal with 
vulnerabilities within applications, 3) prevent unauthorized 
access and 4) protect confidential information. Some of the 
well-known cybersecurity solutions are being provided by 
Accenture, HP, Invensys, IBM, EADS, CISCO, Unisys etc.  
More recently, the focus of cybersecurity has shifted to 
monitoring network and Internet traffic for the detection of bad 
actions as compared to the traditional approach of the detection 
of bad signatures. Specifically, traditional cybersecurity is 
focused on catching malware by scanning incoming traffic 
against malware signatures which only detect limited-scope 
threats that have been already encountered in the past. Also, the 
development of signatures lags far behind the development of 
cyber attack techniques. Thus, techniques like intrusion 
detection systems, firewalls and anti-virus softwares can be 
easily rendered ineffective by hackers. This scenario has 
become more crucial in the presence of big data within 
computer networks – petabytes and exabytes of information 
being transferred daily between nodes make it very easy for 
hackers to enter any network, hide their presence effectively 
and cause severe damage efficiently. These big data problems 
are stressed in the following points: 
• Corporations are now extending their data networks to 
allow partners and customers to access data in 
different ways to facilitate collaboration, hence 
making networks more vulnerable to cyber attacks.  
The advent and extensive use of cloud and mobile 
computing have also generated novel cyber attack 
methods. 
• The advent of big data has seen a corresponding 
increase in the hacking skills of cyber attackers, and 
evading traditional security measures such as 
signature-based tools is now a thing of the past.  
• Due to big data, it is possible only to collect a 
relatively small slice of security information, e.g., 
network logs, Security Information and Event 
Management (SIEM) alerts, access records etc. 
Hence, damage done by novel hacking methods could 
be realized only after an attack. 
• Big data also prevents most security data from being 
analyzed due to its complexity, e.g., data could be 
coming from different sources, it could be stored in 
different formats on different machines, or  could be 
generating too quickly to make any type of analysis 
feasible through traditional techniques, computer 
hardware and software architectures. 
Security Analytics addresses these issues by reinventing the 
wheel of cybersecurity. It employs techniques from Big Data 
Analytics (BDA) to derive useful information for thwarting 
cyber attacks [13]. It is now possible due to the progress in 
hardware and software technology that can cope up with big 
data (see Section II). It provides the following unique features:  
• A more agile decision-making approach for networks 
managers with surveillance and monitoring of real-
 time network streams, 
• Dynamic detection of both known and previously-
 unknown suspicious/malicious behavior, usage, 
access pattern, transaction or network traffic flow, 
applicable to all types of cyber threats 
• Effective detection of suspicious and malicious 
behavior  (least possible false positive rate), 
• Ability to deal with suspicious and malicious behavior 
in real-time,  
• Appropriate dashboard-based visualization techniques 
to provide full visibility (3600 view) of network 
progress and problems in real-time. 
• Appropriate big data hardware and software to cope 
up with the aforementioned requirements. 
The need for the applications of BDA to cybersecurity is just 
starting to be realized even in developed countries like USA. In 
this paper, we present a survey on the BDA cybersecurity 
applications, focusing mainly on the BDA solutions available 
and its importance according to the network landscape of the 
future. This paper is structured as follows: In Section II, we 
present the basics of BDA and in Section III, we detail the 
BDA cybersecurity issues and applications. We conclude the 
paper and present future work in Section IV. 
II. BASICS OF BIG DATA ANALYTICS (BDA) 
Big data is data whose complexity hinders it from being 
managed, queried and analyzed through traditional data storage 
architectures, algorithms, and query mechanisms. The 
“complexity” of big data is defined through 3V’s: 1) volume – 
referring to terabytes, petabytes, or even exabytes (10006 bytes) 
of stored information, 2) variety – referring to the co-existence 
of unstructured, semi-structured and structured data, and 3) 
velocity – referring to the rapid pace at which big data is being 
generated. . Some researchers have added the 4th V, i.e., 
veracity to stress the importance of maintaining quality data 
within an organization. Some primary sources of big data 
transactions are data from computer networks, 
telecommunication networks, finance, healthcare, social media 
networks, bio-informatics, E-Commerce, surveillance etc. The 
domain of Big Data Analytics (BDA) is concerned with the 
extraction of value from big data, i.e., insights which are non-
 trivial, previously unknown, implicit and potentially useful. 
These insights have a direct impact on deciding or 
manipulating the current business strategy and drives what is 
being called “From Data to Decision” initiative [14]. The 
assumption is that patterns of usage, occurrences or behaviors 
exist in big data. BDA attempts to fit mathematical models on 
these patterns through different data mining techniques such as 
130
Predictive Analytics, Cluster Analysis, Association Rule 
Mining, and Prescriptive Analytics [13]. Insights from these 
techniques are typically represented on interactive dashboards 
and help corporations maintain the competitive edge, increase 
profits, and enhance their CRM.  
It is important to note that the term “big” in big data is 
relative; even gigabytes of data can be “big” if it is not being 
managed or queried efficiently. In such a situation, BDA is 
largely supported by Apache’s Hadoop framework, which is an 
open-source, completely fault-tolerant and a highly scalable 
distributed computing paradigm. Hadoop is able to distribute 
BDA tasks across commodity hardware nodes through the 
MapReduce algorithm (of Google).  At an abstract level, data is 
first “mapped” in a domain-specific format and then processed 
at different nodes; results from each node are then “reduced” to 
produce the final result. Hadoop is being used by big 
companies like Yahoo!, Facebook, Twitter, eBay, and Amazon, 
and some notable Hadoop-based BDA solutions are currently 
being offered by IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, Talend, Cloudera, 
Greenplum, Hortonworks and Datameer. Along with this, 
notable names providing big data hardware architectures are 
Teradata, HP (Vertica), Infobright, Aster Data and ParAccel. 
The basic stages of BDA process are shown in Fig. 1. 
Initially, data to be analyzed is selected from real-time streams 
of big data and pre-processed (cleaned). This is called ETL 
(Extract Transform Load) typically and is a strenuous activity 
that can take up to 60% of the effort of BDA, e.g., catering for 
inconsistent, incomplete and missing values, normalizing, 
discretizing and reducing data, ensuring statistical quality of 
data through boxplots, cluster analysis, normality testing etc., 
and understanding data through descriptive statistics 
(correlations, hypothesis testing, histograms etc.). Once data is 
cleaned, it is stored in BDA databases (cloud, mobile, network 
servers etc.) and analyzed with analytics with a possible use of 
Hadoop if required. The results are then shown in interactive 
dashboards using computer visualization techniques. It is 
important to note that BDA is a “trial-and-error” activity driven 
by feedback to any of previous stage in order to refine the 
outputs through “tuning” of analytical approaches.

Fig. 1 also shows well-known corporate solutions (in 
parentheses) that are available for different BDA stages, e.g., 
Informatica for ETL, Netezza for analytics etc.1   
III. SECURITY ANALYTICS WITH BDA 
Compared to traditional approaches, security analytics 
provides a “richer” cybersecurity context by separating what is 
“normal” from what is “abnormal”, i.e., separating the patterns 
generated by legitimate users from those generated by 
suspicious or malicious users.  
A. Big Data Sources for Security Analytics 
The concept of “data” for security analytics is expansive, 
and can be categorized into passive and active sources [15]. 
Passive data sources can include: 
• Computer-based data, e.g., geographical IP location, 
computer security health certificates, keyboard typing 
and clickstream patterns, WAP data. 
• Mobile-based data, e.g., GPS location, network 
location, WAP data. 
• Physical data of user, e.g., time and location of 
physical access of network. 
• Human Resource data, e.g., organizational role and 
privilege of the user. 
• Travel data, e.g., travel patterns, destinations, and 
itineraries. 
• SIEM data, e.g., network logs, threat database, 
application access data. 
• Data from external sources, e.g., rogue IPs, external 
threats. 
Active (relating to real-time) data sources can include: 
• Credential data, e.g., user name and password 
• One-time passwords, e.g., for online access 
• Digital Certificates 
• Knowledge-based questions, e.g., “what is your 
typical    activity on Saturdays from 3 pm to 6 pm?” 
• Biometric identification data, e.g., fingerprint, facial 
recognition, voice recognition, handwriting 
recognition 
• Social media data, e.g., Twitter, Facebook, internal 
office network etc. 
Analytics applied on passive and active sources collectively 
will provide a 3600 view of network traffic, e.g., by singling 
out an abnormal behavior in the access pattern of a given 
user. Appropriate prevention techniques can then be applied, 
e.g., lock accounts, quarantine, modify network settings, 
multiple authentications, alert on an on-going fraud etc.

respective websites.

B. Security Analytics Model 
A security analytics model has the following primary 
characteristics [15]: 
 
• Diverse Data Sources: Data can be acquired from 
many sources (as mentioned in (A)). The frequency 
and complexity of data sources should have no effect 
on the final BDA outputs. 
• Enterprise-level Data Warehouse: All network 
security data should be stored in an enterprise 
warehouse, with network performance measures 
stored in fact tables, and query data in dimension 
tables (time, location, customer etc.). This is 
important as data mining (BDA) solutions are now 
strongly coupled with a warehouse, e.g., Oracle, SQL 
Server, DB2 etc. Different managers (requiring 
different analytics) can generate their own security 
analytics warehousing process.  
• ETL Tools: These tools can help perform ETL at two 
levels, i.e., at a generic level over a complete data 
source, and at specific level over selected data in order 
to apply one or more BDA techniques on it. Some 
common names are Talend, Informatica, Pentaho etc. 
• BDA Engines: These engines combine Hadoop, 
sophisticated hardware and analytics softwares to 
process real-time network streams. As mentioned 
above, these engines are typically coupled with a 
warehouse allowing network managers to employ 
warehouse resources, e.g., ETL, dashboards, data 
maintenance etc. for the BDA tasks as well. 
• Monitoring Systems: These system monitor network 
traffic and compare it with behavior and risk models 
discovered by BDA, or those given by security 
experts based on their experience. 
• Advanced Security Controls: These are used to 
impart appropriate security measures in real-time, 
e.g., additional user authentication, blocking highly 
suspicious transactions, calling customers while the 
transaction is in progress etc. 
• Interactive Dashboards: These apply Business 
Intelligence techniques to display the real-time 
cybersecurity status using interactive tools, e.g., 
graphs, charts, tables etc. A lot of research work is 
being carried out to develop novel visualization 
techniques which are at par with BDA outputs [13]. 
• Robust Security Infrastructure: This should be able 
to facilitate efficient communications between 
different locations or regions along with efficient 
execution of queries using BDA architectures. 
• Big Data Integration Infrastructure: This will 
facilitate integration of data from diverse number of 
data sources, which are quite common as mentioned 
in (A). 
C. Security Analytics for Threat Detection 
The largest application of security analytics is in threat 
monitoring and incident investigations, which is of major 
concern to both financial and defense institutions. The 
focus is on discovering and learning both known and 
unknown cyber attack patterns, which is expected to 
remarkably influence the efficiency of identifying hidden 
threats faster, track down attackers and predict future 
attacks with increasing accuracy (minimum false positive 
rate).  Some examples of how BDA can help with respect 
to different security dimensions are as follows: 
• Network Traffic: Detecting and predicting 
suspicious sources and destinations, along with 
abnormal traffic patterns.  
• Web Transactions: Detecting and predicting 
abnormal user access patterns, particularly in the 
usage of critical resources or activities. 
• Network Servers: Detection and predicting 
abnormal patterns related to server manipulation, 
e.g., abnormal or sudden configuration changes, 
non-compliance with pre-defined policy etc. 
• Network Source: Detecting and predicting 
abnormal usage patterns of any machine, e.g., 
related to the type of data the source transmits, 
processes and receives.  
• User Credentials: Detecting anomalies with 
respect to a user, or a group of user, not complying 
with its inherent access behavior, e.g., abnormal 
access time or transaction amount. 
These activities are bringing a revolutionary change in the 
domains of security management, identity and access 
management, fraud prevention and governance, risk and 
compliance, e.g., through centralization of threat data and 
alert management system, correlating hundred thousands of 
network events per second, real-time continuous 
assessment of risk, distinction between legitimate and 
abnormal activities, along with appropriate prioritization of 
risks. 
D. Steps for Implementing A Security Analytics Solution 
BDA is a relatively novel field. The corporate sector in 
Pakistan is typically more tilted towards the use of traditional 
(simpler) analytical techniques as compared to advanced ones2. 
Hence, it could be some time before the Pakistani network 
companies embrace the BDA technology whole heartedly. A 
major reason for this trend is the uncertainty with respect to the 
usefulness of BDA outputs, as acquiring useful outputs is a 
strenuous recursive activity which requires appropriate BDA 
expertise (data scientists). There is also a lack of in-depth 
technical knowledge regarding basic BDA concepts, e.g., 
Hadoop, Predictive Analytics, Cluster Analysis etc. Finally, 
there are not many proprietary BDA cybersecurity solutions 
that are well-known in the cybersecurity world. With these 
                                                           
2 This statement is derived from the first author’s experience 
of training and consultancy with various Pakistani companies 
132
limitations in mind, we propose the following steps to the 
corporations for adopting a security analytics solution [15]: 
• Develop Security Analytics Business Strategy: The 
first step is to create a business strategy for 
implementing the analytics platform. For this, CIOs 
and CTOs need to initially build the domain 
knowledge by looking at some of the successful 
analytics-based security solutions (detailed in next 
section) to determine their feasibility, impact and 
value for their own organizations. 
• Participate in Analytics Trainings and Workshops: 
The real impact of threat detection can only be 
realized by C-level executives if they understand the 
technical details of BDA. Hence, attending BDA 
workshops and training sessions is particularly 
recommended. Especially because several open-
 source analytical tools, e.g., Rapid Miner, allow users 
to experiment with a host of BDA techniques through 
simple drag-and-drop functionality. Hands-on 
experiments with these tools on security data sets can 
provide in-depth knowledge of the expected BDA 
outputs and aid in developing the analytics strategy. 
• Implement a Centralized Data Management 
Infrastructure: This should allow seamless 
integration of network streams from various sources, 
along with tools to support ETL, stream processing, 
data warehousing, data storage and query execution 
mechanisms. The infrastructure should be flexible to 
extension as well as to modification, e.g., a change of 
ETL tools. 
• Implement an Analytics Platform: This should 
support experimentation with a diverse number of 
BDA tools, techniques and algorithms. An efficient 
communication medium should be provided with the 
data repository to acquire the data and to store BDA 
outputs.  
• Hire Data Scientist as Consultant: As acquiring 
BDA outputs is typically lengthy task requiring 
background knowledge of many domains, it is advised 
to hire a data scientist as a consultant who can guide 
the execution of the BDA process at different stages. 
• Implement a “Network Monitoring” Layer: This 
layer monitors the network streams at run time by 
employing the set of mathematical models that have 
been mined by BDA. It can also employ any type of 
security knowledge given by the system designers 
based on their experience, or knowledge from some 
governmental database regarding new types of 
external threats. This layer should always be “live” as 
network streams are monitored 24/7. It intimidates the 
“Suspicion Alert” later if any suspicious behavior is 
detected. 
• Implement a “Suspicion Alert” Layer: This layer 
implements all the measures that can be taken to 
ensure cybersecurity, e.g., alert authorities of an 
ongoing suspicious transaction, lock access, cross-
 check user identity etc. It must be ensured that this 
module is always “live”, even if the analytics platform 
is not being used at a given time. 
• How to Streamline Analytics with Current 
Workflow? This is the most important question 
facing C-level executives. Due to the uncertainty 
which accompanies BDA, it is advisable to complete 
the aforementioned steps within a minimum level of 
resources initially. These steps should also be 
implemented independently of the current workflow, 
with collaboration occurring only where needed. For 
instance, a team of 4-5 people along with the data 
scientist should be given 5-6 months to implement the 
analytics solution, as an organizational project. Once 
the managers are satisfied with the outputs, steps can 
be taken to infuse the analytics platform gradually in 
the current workflow.  
E. Corporate Security Analytics Solutions 
In this section, we list some of the important corporate 
cybersecurity solutions. The solution by Solera Networks 
[16] provides the following features: 
• Root Cause Analysis: Ability to go back in time from 
any security event to discover the root cause, to 
determine that something happened, what exactly 
happened, and how it entered the network. 
• Pathway Analysis: Ability to go forward in time from 
a security event to determine the full purport of this 
event in the future, e.g., expected path, damage etc. 
• Application Discovery: Ability to discover suspicious 
applications on the network, allowing security systems 
to block applications based on an application ID. 
• Data Leakage Discovery: Ability to provide the 
reasons behind data loss based on the context of the 
lost information 
• Insider Threat Analysis: Ability to keep track of the 
activity of employees to foresee and detect reasons of 
possible attacks carried out by them. 
Fortscale [17] is a high-tech startup by a group of Israeli 
entrepreneurs whose security analytics solution has the 
following features: 
• Discovery of targeted and high-level cyber attacks 
• Detection of malicious employees who take advantage 
of their legitimate permissions to leak information 
• Real-time Analytics of access to sensitive data 
• Verification of security alerts 
• Identify compromised machines by sophisticated 
malware. 
IBM has also developed a solution called IBM Security 
Intelligence [18] which has the following features: 
• Real-time abnormality detection of diverse security 
data 
133
• High-speed querying of security intelligence data 
• Flexible BDA across all types of data sources 
• Interactive visualization dashboards for exploring 
BDA outputs 
• Network forensics (the measurement of network 
performance variables)  
Finally, Actian has implemented the Actian DataRush [19] 
solution which has the following features: 
• Monitoring up to 1 million events per second 
• Dynamic scaling of big data architectures 
• Detection of abnormal patterns, event correlations, 
intrusion detection, threat and vulnerability 
assessment, discovery of security events 
The aforementioned features are novel and are also being 
offered by other names include Juniper [20], RSA [21], 
LogRythm [22] and Blue Coat [23]. 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
      In this paper, we have highlighted the state of the art issues 
facing the cybersecurity domain in the face of big data. 
Traditional security solutions are not capable anymore of 
encompassing the real-time big data network streams using 
traditions tools and techniques. We have shown how Security 
Analytics – the application of Big Data Analytics techniques 
to derive actionable intelligence and insights from streams in 
real-time – is rapidly becoming a strong need for cybersecurity 
setups. Although the current adoption of analytical solutions is 
by no means revolutionary (as shown by this study by 
Teradata [24]), the awareness of adoption is increasing 
rapidly. To support this cause, in the paper, we specifically 
mention the different types of big data sources for such an 
analytics solution, the primary components of a security 
analytics model, some examples of security analytics outputs, 
steps for implementing a security analytics solution, and 
finally, the corporates which are offering analytics solutions 
for cybersecurity along with their features. We are currently 
applying security analytics techniques on network-related 
datasets of our institute in order to try and decrease the false 
positive rate of a predictive model for fraudulent transactions.
