 Abstract—Data in astronomy is rapidly growing with up-
 coming surveys producing 30 TB of images per night. Highly
 informative spectra are too expensive to measure for each
 detected object, hence ways of reliably estimating physical
 properties from images alone are paramount. The objective
 of this work is to test whether a “big data ready” k-nearest
 neighbour regression can successfully estimate the specific star
 formation rate (sSFR) from colours of low-redshift galaxies.
 The nearest neighbour algorithm achieves a root mean square
 error (RMSE) of 0.30, outperforming the state-of-the-art as-
 tronomical model achieving a RMSE of 0.36.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 The traditional workflow in astronomy has heavily relied
 on the analysis of single events. Acquiring and process-
 ing data was slow and expensive and the resulting post-
 processed data were often of low quality. In the past decades,
 however, ever larger astronomical surveys, such as the Sloan
 Digital Sky Survey (SDSS), have appeared, which have led
 to an enormous amount of high-resolution and publicly
 available astronomical images. The SDSS alone provides
 images of nearly 109 objects, making astronomy enter a
 new big data era. Even larger surveys will start collecting
 data soon. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) is
 expected to produce 30TB of images per night, which need
 to be analysed in near real-time, in order to trigger time-
 critical follow-up observations. Thus, efficient large-scale
 data mining techniques are required.
 Many astronomically interesting properties of an object
 can only be measured from a spectrum of its light. A
 spectrum is, roughly speaking, the photon count at each
 wavelength of the received light, and since each chemical
 element has a unique spectrum, a lot of information can be
 extracted from the light of, for instance, a star or a galaxy
 (see figure 1). Spectra of stars are very well understood, but
 for galaxies containing stars, gas and dust, each contributing
 to the final spectrum, extracting relevant information is more
 difficult. To extract such information, the individual contri-
 butions from stars, gas and dust must be disentangled. To
 this end, astronomers build models. These models simulate
 emission of light from stars from different populations at
 different ages, adding in the contributions from gas and
 dust in the galaxy and in the intermediate space. Comparing
 the resulting model spectra to the real spectrum then allows
 astronomers to extract relevant information about the galaxy.
 One particular galactic property that we are concerned
 with in this study is the rate at which new stars are formed,
 the star formation rate (SFR). The SFR is an important
 quantity to measure, as it relates to the evolutionary history
 of a galaxy, and it is most easily measured from the spectrum
 of the galaxy. A derived measure often used by astronomers
 is the specific star formation rate (sSFR), which is the SFR
 normalised by the mass of stars in the galaxy.
 Observation time is, unfortunately, a scarce resource, and
 measuring a spectrum is very expensive and time consuming.
 A much cheaper way to study the sky is to take images.
 These images can contain thousands of objects and are
 usually acquired in multiple bandpass filters, each spanning
 a range of the spectrum, see figure 2. From these images, it
 is possible to extract the intensity of an object in each filter,
 and from the intensities, one can extract the magnitude of the
 object in each filter. Subtracting two magnitudes from each
 other effectively removes a bias parameter, and the resulting
 value is known as a colour. The colours of an object can also
 be found from the spectrum itself; the intensity of the object
 in a given filter is the product of the filter transmission with
 the spectrum, integrated over all wavelengths. The colours of
 an object are therefore linked to its spectrum and so should
 contain a significant amount of information.
 Against this background, we study the potential of using
 a scalable machine learning approach to predict the sSFR
 from colour values obtained from galaxy images. The next
 section briefly describes the data and the current model-
 based approach to sSFR calculation and prediction. We then
 describe our machine learning approach. Sections IV and V
 present experiments and results before we conclude.

 II. STAR FORMATION RATE DATA FROM THE SLOAN
 DIGITAL SKY SURVEY
 The data considered in this study come from Sloan Digital
 Sky Survey (SDSS), an astronomical survey that has been
 scanning the night sky since 2000, see figure 1. The SDSS
 provides photometric data (images) as well as spectroscopic
 data (spectra) of selected objects. The photometric data
 are observed in five bandpass filters, spanning wavelengths
 from 3000Å to 11 000Å, while the spectroscopic data span
 wavelengths from 3800Å to 9200Å, see figure 2. The
 database currently contains images of 9.3? 108 objects and
 spectra of 1.6? 106 objects, about half being galaxies.
 Ground truth sSFR values for selected objects are also
 made available by SDSS. The derivation of these values is
 described in the following, see [1] and [2] for details. The
 SFR of a galaxy is measured from parts of its spectrum
 associated with newly formed stars. These parts, however,
 are contaminated by contributions from both inter- and
 intragalactic gas and dust, and a disentangling of these
 components is necessary. To do so, a library of ?2? 105
 artificial model spectra are generated from simulations with
 varying physical parameters. From these spectra the SFR
 and stellar mass, and in turn the sSFR, can be calculated. To
 estimate the sSFR of a real galaxy, its spectrum is compared
 to each of the model spectra. The sSFRs of the models are
 then weighted based on the likelihood of the model spectra
 given the real spectrum, resulting in a probability distribution
 for the sSFR. From this distribution, the final sSFR of the
 galaxy is calculated as the expected sSFR.
 If only photometric data are available, estimation of the
 sSFR must rely on the magnitude of the galaxy in each
 bandpass filter. The current state-of-the-art approach in this
 regard (see [3]) follows the procedure outlined above to a
 large extent; a library of model spectra, each associated with
 a particular set of physical parameters, is generated, but
 instead of using the spectra directly, they are multiplied with
 the SDSS filter transmissions and integrated over all wave-
 lengths to produce model magnitudes. To estimate the sSFR
 of a real galaxy, its photometric magnitudes are compared to
 the magnitudes of each model in the library. The sSFRs of
 the models are then weighted based on the likelihood of the
 model magnitudes given the real magnitudes, resulting in a
 probability distribution for the sSFR. From this distribution,
 the predicted sSFR of the galaxy is again calculated as the
 expected sSFR.
 Data used in this study: The data used in this study are
 a subset of SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7). For each galaxy,
 only the five magnitudes (we use the SDSS MODELMAG
 magnitudes) and the sSFR are considered. The magnitudes
 have been subtracted from each other, resulting in a four-
 vector representing the colours. We only consider galaxies
 in SDSS that meet the following selection criteria:
 • A spectrum is available, that is, a reliable ground truth
 sSFR is available.
 • Magnitudes are larger than ?9999 (which indicates a
 failed magnitude estimation).
 • SSFR is larger than ?99 (which indicates a failed sSFR
 estimation).
 A sample of 694 894 galaxies meet these criteria. For a small
 subset of 11 450 low-redshift galaxies within the selected
 sample, we additionally have sSFR predictions obtained by
 the template-based modelling approach described above. No
 additional selection criteria have been applied to this subset.
 III. PREDICTING THE SSFR USING SIMPLE MACHINE
 LEARNING TECHNIQUES
 Measuring a spectrum of a galaxy is a time-consuming
 task, so in order to take advantage of the enormous amounts
 of readily available astronomical data, it is essential that one
 can reliably estimate physical properties from photometric
 data alone. The template-based method, as described in
 section II, is, however, not a viable solution considering the
 rapidly growing amount of data. Instead, scalable machine
 learning techniques provide a promising solution to this
 problem.
 The large data sets in astronomy require fast algorithms,
 and it is therefore common to resort to very basic machine
 learning techniques. For example, nearest neighbour regres-
 sion has been successfully applied to mining SDSS data for
 detecting distant quasars, one of the most challenging tasks
 in astronomy [4].
 In this work we use exact k nearest neighbour regression
 (k-NN, see [5] for an overview of efficient, scalable imple-
 mentations) to estimate the sSFRs for a set of galaxies, using
 only their four colours computed from five photometric
 magnitudes. For a given input sample x ? R4, the k nearest
 neighbours within the training data are determined using the
 Euclidean distance. The average sSFRs of the k neighbours
 is the predicted sSFR of x. The dimensionality of the feature
 142
space is very low and the training data set is sufficiently large
 making k-NN regression a viable approach.
 IV. EXPERIMENTS
 We performed two experiments, one comparing the ma-
 chine learning with astrophysical modelling results and
 another assessing the approach on a larger subset of the
 SDSS database. These experiments were conducted using
 the Shark machine learning library [6].
 A. Comparison with template-based model
 We compared the nearest neighbour approach with the
 template-based model described above on the subset of
 11 450 galaxies for which results from the template-based
 model are available. To asses the performance of the algo-
 rithm, we used cross validation (CV) partitioning the data
 into 10 folds [7]. We refer to this procedure as the outer
 CV.
 For each of the 10 folds, we independently determined a
 proper value of k. This was done using an inner 10-fold CV
 procedure splitting the available training fold from the outer
 CV. We selected the k ? {1, 3, 5, . . . , 25} with the lowest
 average inner CV test error. This k was used to predict the
 sSFRs of the outer CV’s validation data fold using the outer
 CV’s training data fold.
 To make the estimations by the k-NN and the template-
 based model comparable, the predictions by the template-
 based model were divided into the same 10 subsets as used
 in the outer CV of the k-NN and the same statistics were
 calculated.
 B. Application to larger subset of SDSS
 In the previous experiments, the k values chosen in the 10
 model selection procedures were concentrated around k =
 21, however, different values of k gave similar performance
 as long as k > 15. In the second experiment, we considered
 our full SDSS DR7 subset, for which spectrum-based ground
 truth sSFRs are available. We randomly selected 30 000
 galaxies for training a 21-NN regression and used the
 remaining 664 894 galaxies for testing.
 V. RESULTS
 For the first experiment, we report the average RMSEs
 and the standard deviations1 over the 10 validation sets of
 the outer CV of the predictions by the k-NN regression and
 the state-of-the-art template-based model compared to the
 ground truth sSFRs. The template-based model achieved
 a RMSE of 0.36± 0.01 on our data set, while the k-NN
 model achieved a RMSE of 0.30± 0.01. The k-NN model
 performs considerably better than the slower, template-
 based, physically motivated, model.
 1The standard deviations should not be interpreted as strict confidence
 intervals, since the data folds in the CV procedure are not statistically
 independent.

 A visualisation of the correlations between the predictions
 of the two models and the ground truths is given in figure 3.
 The main difference between the predictions by the two
 models seems to be the position of the peak corresponding
 to low sSFRs; while the k-NN model overshoots a bit, the
 template-based model undershoots considerably.
 In the second experiment, the k-NN regression also
 achieved a RMSE of 0.30 on the larger, more heterogeneous
 data set. A visualisation of the correlations between the
 predictions of the k-NN regression and the ground truths
 is given in figure 4.
 VI. CONCLUSIONS
 Increasingly larger astronomical surveys are leading to an
 enormous amount of high-resolution and publicly available
 astronomical images. Many astronomically interesting prop-
 erties of an object can, however, most reliably be measured
 from a spectrum of its light, which is expensive to measure.
 A much cheaper way to make astronomical discoveries is
 to use images directly. Many physical properties can be

 estimated from these images, though much less accurately
 than from a spectrum. The large data sets demand more
 efficient ways of estimating quantities than the current state-
 of-the-art model provides, if we are to take advantage of the
 wealth of information hidden in the data. This invites for ap-
 plying scalable machine learning algorithms. We exemplified
 this by predicting the specific star formation rate (sSFR) of
 galaxies using a scalable machine learning approach, which
 outperformed the state-of-the-art astronomical model. On a
 small sample of low-redshift galaxies from the SDSS DR7
 database, nearest neighbour regression achieved a RMSE
 of 0.30 compared to 0.36 achieved by a template-based,
 physically motivated model. Applied to all galaxies with
 spectra and reliable colour and sSFR measurements in DR7,
 the error of our approach was 0.30. The proposed algorithm
 allows for screening large amounts of imaging data and
 for picking out samples for further analysis. An advantage
 of the template-based model is, of course, the additional
 physical knowledge gained from simulating galaxies. The
 higher accuracy achieved by the k-NN model indicates,
 however, that the template-based model does not capture all
 the information available in the colours.
