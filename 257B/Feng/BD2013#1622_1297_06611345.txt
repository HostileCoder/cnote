Abstract: Petroleum industries’ big data characterize 
heterogeneity and they are often multidimensional in nature. In the 
recent past, explorers narrate petroleum system, as an ecosystem, in 
which elements and processes are constantly interacted and 
communicated each other. Exploration is one of the key super-type 
data dimensions of petroleum ecosystem, (including seismic 
dimension), exhibiting high degree of heterogeneity, sequence 
identity and structural similarity; this is especially the case for, 
elements and processes that are unique to petroleum systems of South 
East Asia. Existing approaches of petroleum data organizations have 
limitations in capturing and integrating petroleum systems data. An 
alternative method uses ontologies and does not rely on keywords or 
similarity metrics. The conceptual framework of petroleum ontology 
(PO) is to promote reuse of concepts and a set of algebraic operators 
for querying petroleum ontology instances. This ontology-based fine-
 grained multidimensional data structuring adapts to warehouse 
metadata modeling. The data integration process facilitates to 
metadata models, which are deduced for Indonesian sedimentary 
basins, and is useful for data mining and subsequent data 
interpretation including geological knowledge mapping.

I INTRODUCTION 
 
Petroleum-bearing sedimentary basin is an emerging 
digital ecosystem [5]. Petroleum system and its elements are 
narrated for each and every oil and gas field in each and every 
petroleum-bearing sedimentary basin. A new concept of 
ecosystem and its digitization are emerging within the generic 
petroleum system. The significance of this concept comes with 
an ability to establish connectivity among petroleum 
subsystems. Big data that evolve, from petroleum ecosystems 
scenarios consist of multidimensional and heterogeneous data 
instances; modeling and mapping of data instances is a tedious 
process.    In the past decade, there has been an explosive 
growth in the volumes of published petroleum data, as a result 
of the rapid development and progress of exploration and 
development projects worldwide. The contribution to and 
organization of such data by the industry’s professional 
organizations, national and private oil and gas companies and 
some major service companies, have resulted in a wealth of 
available big-data.  
 
Petroleum ontology (PO) describes the semantics of all 
data sources and conceptually analyzed data in the multiple 
contexts and domains of multiple petroleum systems of 
sedimentary basins (Fig. 1). The sheer volume of big-data 
from Southeast Asian basins makes it hard to find sequences 
(events of petroleum system) of interest in each release of 
heterogeneous databases. The data are often distributed as a 
collection of flat files, each containing some textual 
information (the annotation), such as, basin name (both 
onshore and offshore) oil/gas-field-name and keywords, such 
as names of producing-horizon and pay-zones and their 
identifiers. The main method of searching for zones of interest 
in such databases has been using a string-matching program. 
Although this has motivated the development of relational 
database management systems in the main database centers, 
the databases have continued to be delivered as flat files. 
Ontology based multi-dimensional databases are designed, 
developed and delivered as accurate data views for data 
mining and interpretation purposes [1]. During organization of 
the data, completeness, uniqueness, validity, integrity and 
consistency are ensured as per company standards and 
protocols. Much of the value of petroleum resources is a part 
of an interconnected network of related databases. Many 
databases [4] are cross-referenced to other databases, often 
through manual entries. These cross-references provide the 
basic platform for more advanced data integration strategies to 
address the problems, including: (a) establishing identity of 
common concepts, (b) integration of data described in 
different formats, (c) the resolution of conflicts among 
different resources, (d) data synchronization, data mining, 
fusion and visualization and (e) interpretation of unified data 
views for knowledge mapping.  
Furthermore, traditional data warehouses may not be able 
to handle the processing demands posed by big data. As a 
result, a new class of big data technology [7] has emerged and 
is being used in many big data analytics environments. Great 
attention is needed in designing the metadata structures, 
especially keeping in view the multidimensionality and 
heterogeneity of data relevant to petroleum ecosystems. 
Authors in recent years, emphasize on ontology based 
multidimensional data warehousing and mining technologies 
in spite of several products associated with big data analytics, 
NoSQL databases, Hadoop and MapReduce, are in the market. 
Though these technologies form the core of an open source 
software framework that supports the processing of large data 
sets, across clustered systems, but handling real time spatio-

temporal big-data across multiple geographic locations 
(operations taking place in multiple countries) is tedious for 
integration and time-consuming even for business analysis. 
II PETROLEUM BIG-DATA INTEGRATION ISSUES 
 
Big data is a general term used to describe the voluminous 
amount of petroleum unstructured and semi-structured data, 
often operating companies create - data that would take too 
much time and cost too much money to load into relational 
databases. Even structured data are not effective to bring out 
data trends and patterns, because of poorly organized data 
structures and ineffective data integration procedures. In 
addition, it is an enormous task acquiring and integrating the 
datasets in real-time. Semantics, schematics and syntactic 
heterogeneities must be addressed during ontology 
descriptions. Unfortunately, the semantics of petroleum 
resource data are often difficult to explain, in particular for 
conceptually analyzed data in which several categories and 
classifications are interpreted. Because of varied degree of 
change in semantic and contextual contents, the interpreted 
data are not explicitly stated, but are implicitly included in the 
database design. PO (much less all geology or petroleum 
geology science), is not a single consistent scientific domain, 
but subsumes dozens of interrelated knowledge domains. For 
characterizing and organizing multidimensional metadata 
structures in warehouse environments, ontologies are 
characteristically used.

distributed onshore and offshore areas (source: [6]) 
 
This would not be a significant issue, if explorers only 
access data from within a single domain, but that is not usually 
the case. Typically, explorers require integrated access to data 
from multiple domains, which requires resolving terms that 
have slightly different meanings across different domains. 
Schematic or structural heterogeneities observed among 
petroleum system elements and processes from global scale to 
local scale are handled by schematic ontologies. Similarly, 
semantic heterogeneities may have occurred during 
interpretation of meaning of data-views from multiple sources, 
implying multiple petroleum systems consisting of oil and gas 
fields or drilled wells or surveys. Syntactic heterogeneities   or 
differences in formatting styles of data from multiple sources, 
as is the case, which occurs with multiple petroleum systems 
and their data representation, are other anomalies addressed 
during ontology descriptions. This issue is further complicated 
by the observations that the specific domain whose 
terminology is being used by the data source is usually not 
explicitly identified and the terminology evolves over time. 
Geology also demonstrates three challenges for data 
integration that are common in evolving scientific domains, 
but are not typically found elsewhere. The first is the sheer 
number of available data sources and the inherent 
heterogeneity of their contents. Some of these sources contain 
data from a single laboratory or project, whereas others are the 
definitive repositories [2] for very specific types of 
information (e.g., for a specific reservoir class). Not only do 
these sources complicate the concept identification issue 
previously mentioned (because they use highly specialized 
data semantics), but they also make it feasible to incorporate 
all of them into a consistent repository. Second, the data 
formats and data access methods change regularly. These 
changes are an attempt to keep up with the scientific evolution 
occurring in the domain at large. However, a change in a data 
source representation can have dramatic impact on systems 
that integrate multiple sources, at times causing the integration 
to fail in the new format. Third, the data and related analyses 
are becoming increasingly complex, especially spatio-
 temporal data, such as geological and geophysical (G & G) 
data. The transformation of voluminous geological data into 
useful information and valuable knowledge is the challenge of 
knowledge discovery. Identification and interpretation of 
interesting patterns hidden among trillions of seismic and 
other exploration big data-points is a critical goal of geo-
 informatics. As demonstrated in Figure 1, in the context of 
South East Asia, hundreds of oil & gas fields possess huge 
amount of G & G (Geology & Geophysics) and E & P 
(Exploration & Production) data. This complicates the goal of 
identification of useful reservoir structures from variety and 
multiple petro-geological sequences. 
 
III  PETROLEUM DATA MANAGEMNET AND 
KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY 
 
The field of geo-informatics plays an increasing role in the 
study of fundamental geological problems owing to the 
exponential explosion of sequence and structural information 
with time. There are two major challenging areas in geo-
 informatics: data management and knowledge discovery. In 
order to address these challenges, multiple heterogeneous data 
are integrated into logical database structures and thus derived, 
metadata range into several scales—presenting huge analysis, 
for data mining and visualization opportunities. A challenge to 
data management involves managing and integrating the 
existing G & G databases. However, in some situations, a 
single database cannot provide answers to the complex 
978-1-4799-0786-1/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 149
problems of geologists and geophysicists. Integrating or 
assembling information from several databases to solve 
problems and discovering new knowledge are other major 
challenges in geo-informatics. The transformation of 
voluminous exploration data into valuable geological 
knowledge is the challenge of knowledge discovery process. 
Data mining and interpretation of interesting patterns hidden 
in trillions of seismic and other exploration data are critical 
goals of geo-informatics. The goals cover identification of 
useful reservoir bearing structures from petroleum ecosystems 
[5].  
IV PO FRAMEWORK 
 
A comprehensive framework is discussed in [1] and [5] in 
different petroleum ecosystems scenarios. A conceptual 
framework of PO, as discussed in Fig. 2, keeps criteria (1) a 
hierarchical classification of concepts represented as classes, 
from general to specific; (2) a list of attributes related to each 
concept, for each class; (3) a set of relations between classes 
to link concepts in ontology in more information-rich ways 
than implied by the hierarchy, thus promoting reuse of 
concepts in the ontology; and (4) a set of algebraic operators 
for querying petroleum ontology instances. The contexts of 
PO domains, (Fig. 2), depict the overall layered approach for 
generic PO structure. Three layers are distinguished here: 
 
1. Real-world data and information sources are considered—
 various proprietary G- & G- and petroleum engineering 
data sources, including scientific reports, company and 
project documents, and published literature. 
2. Data elements and models (both of inherent data 
descriptors resulting from patterns in data, and formal 
data models defined by scientists for specialized 
applications) possess different formats and the anomalies 
are addressed by PO syntactic structure. These data 
models represent post analysis information exchange. 
Both human and machine agents that access and analyze 
the ontology are considered. Human agents, such as 
geoscientists interpret and analyze ontology directly using 
their expertise. For machine agents to interpret and 
analyze ontology, at the same level as human agents, the 
expertise represents using semantic relationships and 
articulation rules in an ontology framework, as shown in 
Fig. 2. 
 
V  GENERIC AND DERIVED CONCEPTS OF PO 
 
Our common conceptual model for the internal 
representation of PO is based on the work done in [4]. The 
authors describe ontologies in the health field domain, citing 
implementation of ontology models in gene technology. A 
similar ontology framework provides a common vocabulary 
for structured and unstructured information, including G- & 
G- and E- & P- practitioners; it is a medium to share and 
access knowledge in petroleum/reservoir-geology domain. 
 
 
Fig. 2: PO general framework modeling 
heterogeneous data sources 
Specifically, a PO describes a series of events (Fig. 2), 
especially in the context of the petroleum exploration domain 
that can be used to depict reservoirs in any field or to depict 
drillable wells. PO describes:  
 
1. Reservoir or/ seismic sequence and structure information 
2. Structure or /reservoir integration process 
3. G & G and geochemical processes of structures, reservoirs 
and sources 
4. Reservoir/ or structural internal and external data 
associations to petroleum accumulations; 
5. Constraints affecting the final petroleum trap/s or seal 
conformation.  
 
PO removes the constraints of potential conflicts arising 
during conceptualization and interpretations of terms in 
various data sources and provides a structured vocabulary that 
integrates all data and knowledge sources in a unified domain. 
There are eight concepts of PO, called generic concepts, which 
are used (and reused in different domains and in a broad scale, 
basins) to define complex concepts: {{structure, reservoir, 
source, seal}, {chain}, {generation, migration, timing, 
accumulations}}, linked by “chains” an evolved concept. 
These conceptualized dimensions are typically narrated in 
hierarchical structure, as demonstrated in Fig. 3. PO specifies 
different topological relationships among structure, reservoir 
and source, in order to illustrate how mandatory semantic 
constraints are represented. Source and structure have a 
mandatory constraint with reservoir because every structure 
(trap) and every source must topologically touch (analogues to 
chain as derived in Fig. 3) one or more instances of a 
reservoir. Producing oil or gas field must contain at least one 
reservoir, while reservoirs have a mandatory relationship with 
trap in a producing field. 
 
Elements of petroleum system, their constraints and limits 
may be explored and gathered on the internet through public 
Web knowledge domains. Notice in the Web Ontology 
Language (OWL) representation that minimum cardinality “1” 
is explicitly represented and is retrieved. Instances of chains

of former elements of PO are defined in the chains concept 
(Fig. 4). The multidimensional data structure of PO elements 
is represented as instances of the elements, chains and 
processes concepts. Defining elements, chains and processes 
as individual concepts, has the benefit that any special 
properties or changes affecting a particular element, chain and 
process, can be easily added to PO. 
 
 
 
Fig. 3: A multidimensional hierarchical structure 
view - describing dimensions of each system element 
 
If PO concept is tagged to a Total Petroleum System all the 
details of petroleum system elements, processes and chains are 
described within that contextualization, conceptualization and 
specification. Data about binding elements and processes, each 
in chains, are again entered into ontology as their instances. 
Data among elements are chained by the elements-chains 
concept. Similarly, data among processes are chained by the 
process-chains concept. Similarly, data among elements and 
processes are chained by elements-processes-chains concepts. 
Chains are conceptually described by their instances. 
 
The structure of PO provides concepts necessary to 
describe individual elements, processes and chains. Instances 
of these dimensions are stored either in excel files, ASCII, or 
in databases in Web ontology language (OWL) format. The 
complete multidimensional hierarchy of PO is shown in Figs. 
3 and 4. Another significant feature of representation of the 
structures is refining the boundaries or limits of system 
elements or processes. 
 
As narrated in Fig. 4, the relationships are drawn among 
elements and processes. Several logical rules and constraints 
applicable for scalability of PO models and multiple levels of 
information stored in PO models for query, information 
retrieval and presentation, are illustrated in Fig. 5. Data views 
retrieved from metadata cubes are analyzed for data 
correlations and patterns. For this purpose, data visualization, 
data fusion and interpretation are used for knowledge 
discovery.

VI  BIG DATA ANALYSIS 
 
One of the primary goals for examining big data [7] is to 
discover repeatable technical and business-data patterns. It’s 
generally accepted that unstructured data, most of it located in 
text files, accounts for at least 80% of an organization’s data. 
If left unmanaged, the sheer volume of unstructured data that’s 
generated each year within an enterprise or company can be 
costly in terms of storage. Big data analytics [7] is often 
associated with cloud computing because the analysis of large 
data sets in real-time requires a framework like MapReduce to 
distribute the work among tens, hundreds or even thousands of 
computers. Big data analytics is the process of examining 
large amounts of data of a variety of types (big data) to 
uncover hidden patterns, unknown correlations and other 
useful information. Such information provides competitive 
advantages over rival organizations and result in business

benefits, such as more effective marketing and increased

ontologically described metadata for interpretation and 
knowledge discovery (mining algebra for extracting data 
views) 
 
The crucial goal of big data analytics is to help operating 
companies make better technical and business decisions by 
enabling data scientists and other users to analyze huge 
volumes of technical and commercial data as well as other 
data sources that may be left untapped by conventional 
business intelligence (BI) programs. The other data sources 
may include Web server logs and Internet clickstream data, 
social media activity reports, mobile-phone call detail records 
and information captured by sensors. Some people exclusively 
associate big data and big data analytics [7] with unstructured 
data of that sort, but consulting firms like Gartner Inc. and 
Forrester Research Inc. also consider transactions and other 
structured data to be valid forms of big data. 
Big data analytics [7] is done with the software tools 
commonly used, as part of advanced analytics disciplines such 
as predictive analytics and data mining. But the unstructured 
data sources used for big data analytics may not fit in 
traditional data warehouses. Potential pitfalls that can rise with 
organizations on big data analytics initiatives include a lack of 
internal analytics skills and the high cost of hiring experienced 
analytics professionals, plus challenges in integrating Hadoop 
systems and data warehouses, although vendors are starting to 
offer software connectors between those technologies and 
integrated platforms. Authors proposed various integrated 
frameworks and as designed and developed in [1] and [5] for 
petroleum industries, use visualization and mining G & G data 
views for interpretation.   
A G- & G- DATA MINING AND FUSION 
As narrated in an integrated framework [5], ontology based 
multidimensional modeling is done to generate a metadata and 
accommodate metadata in a warehouse environment. As 
described in Fig.2, integrated frameworks [5] are collaborated 
to facilitate the data visualization, mining and interpretation 
processes. Data mining in essence, explores data correlations, 
trends and patterns among petroleum heterogeneous metadata. 
Several algorithms are available in the literature [3]; one of the 
popular ones is representation of multidimensional data cube 
and its slicing and dicing [3].  Data fusion is the process of 
integration of multiple data and knowledge representing the 
same real-world object into a consistent, accurate, and 
interpretable representation. Fusion of the data sources 
(multiple dimensions) yields a classifier superior to any other 
classifiers based on dimensions and their fusion 
representations. Data fusion processes are often categorized as 
low, intermediate or high, depending on the processing stage 
at which fusion takes place. Low-level data fusion combines 
several sources of raw data to produce a new arrangement of 
raw data. The expectation is that fused data is more 
informative and synthetic than the original inputs. In a much 
more complicated application, petroleum exploration 
researchers use “data fusion” to review and display integrated 
products of exploration and production data with other 
associated systems [6]. Other ecosystems include data 
acquired from a marine system such as bathymetric; in an 
environment system, such as meteorological, sea surface 
temperature (SST) and bore-hole temperature are examined to 
understand petroleum system integration and its ecosystem 
behavior in reaction to other associated ecosystems. Through 
the use of data fusion, all data and attributes are brought 
together into a single view in which, a more complete picture 
of the system is created and interpreted for the case of 
Southeast Asian larger sedimentary basin setting (examples of 
data fusion as narrated in Figs. 6 and 7). This enables 
geoscientists to gain new insights on interactions between 
different petroleum ecosystems. Data fusion is significant, and 
reservoir-trap presentation, have increased understanding of 
petroleum ecosystem visualization process.

of a clastic reservoir from integrated metadata 
In the petroleum systems analysis and knowledge domains, 
data fusion is often synonymous with representation of 
integrated interpreted data or map-views of multidimensional 
data views. In these applications, there is often a need to 
combine system elements and their datasets into a unified 
(fused) dataset, in which all the data instances from domains, 
(such as seismic, drilled-well, reservoir, drilling and 
production) are interlinked and integrated into a single 
conceptual domain, which could be chains. The fused dataset

 1. SELECT operator is defined as: OS = ? (NS, ES, RS) where NS = Nodes (condition = true) and ES = Edges (N ? NS). 
2. INTERSECTION: OI (1, 2) = O1 ?SR O2 = (NI, EI, RI), where: NI = Nodes (SR (O1, O2)), EI = Edges (E1, NI ? N1) + Edges (E2, NI ? N2) + Edges (SR (O1, O2)), and RI = 
Relationships (O1, NI ? N1) + Relationships (O2, NI ? N2) + SR (O1, O2) – Edges (SR (O1, O2)).
 3. UNION: OI (1, 2) = O1 USR O2 = (NU, EU, RU), where, NU = N1 U N2 U NI (1, 2), EU = E1 U E2 U EI (1, 2), and RU = R1 U R2 U RI (1, 2), where, OI (1, 2) = O1 ?SR O2 = (NI 
(1, 2), EI (1, 2), RI (1, 2))
 DIFFERENCE: O1 – (O1 ?SR O2); O1, O2 are two different domain ontologies; SR: Semantic Relationships; N: set of Nodes; E: set of edges;

is different from a combined superset. The data points in the 
fused data set can contain attribute strengths and magnitudes 
(computed or derived from hypotheses). In fact, fused 
metadata may not represent the contextual or conceptual views 
as that described in the original data. Data instances built with 
conceptual chains are preserved in the original fact tables. 
More commonly, data warehousing supports the data fusion 
concept. Data warehousing consists of collecting functions 
providing access to, and management of, data fusion 
databases, including data retrieval, storage, archiving, 
compression, relational queries, and protection. Data 
warehousing, for data fusion systems may pose problems, 
because of the large and varied data (i.e., images, signal data, 
vectors, and textural data) and the data rates both for ingestion 
of incoming exploration data, and for rapid retrieval.  
Knowledge based data fusion: Interpretation of fused data 
for G & G interpretations, with valid calibrations and 
assumptions, is used to obtain data trends and patterns 
ensuring good agreement with original data. These 
calibrations are in the form of two-dimensional graphic or map 
views drawn for Southeast Asian basins (Figs. 6-8). As 
modeled using integrated framework described in [5], data 
views (through OLAP [3] and [5]) are extracted from 
integrated metadata structures. In particular, these are 
extended-form of knowledge-based or expert systems 
developed, to interpret the results of processing, analyzing 
issues such as contexts in which the data, the relationships 
among multiple dimensions, hierarchical groupings of targets 
or objects, and predictions of future actions of targets are 
perceived. Such reasoning is normally performed by analytical 
solutions, but it is approximated by hypotheses, wherever 
necessary.

VII CONCLUSIONS 
Big data systems that impact petroleum ecosystems 
management scenario, too need an integrated approach for 
building semantic, syntactic and schematic relationships 
among multidimensional and heterogeneous data sources. A 
common conceptual representation of PO is needed to resolve 
the heterogeneity among petroleum data sources to enable 
meaningful data exchange among them. Semantic 
relationships in petroleum ecosystems’ data are discussed that 
interpret semantics that are normally not interpreted by 
annotating systems. PO algebra that allows composition of 
multiple levels of information stored in the ontology for 
information query and retrieval is discussed. PO rules and 
logic are applicable for worldwide basins. PO algebra based 
on semantic relationships, allows systematic composition that 
unlike integration is more scalable. Further advantages include 
reduced time of data search - correct information in one 
database only, and reduced risk of key business decisions and 
interpretations being made on incorrect, incomplete, or non-
 validated data. Fine-grained ontologies are effective for 
mining South East Petroleum Ecosystems; data views 
represented for visualization and fusion, are useful for 
interpretation and knowledge discovery.
