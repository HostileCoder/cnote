 Abstract—In Mobile Ad hoc network, nodes are connected 
through a wireless are formed a fast changed network structure 
and it is a infrastructure less, can be set up anytime, anywhere. 
The nodes are mobile based on battery operated and nodes have 
limited battery resources. Routing protocol selection in Mobile 
Ad Hoc Network is a big challenge, because of its regular 
topology changes and routing overhead. In Manet, energy 
efficient protocols are used to forward data packets one to 
another without much packet loss. Energy reactive routing 
protocol is effective routing protocol in Manet and nodes are 
requires energy efficient routing protocols to bound the power 
consumption, and lengthen the battery life to improve the life 
time of the network. The main objective of this paper is to 
enhance the network performance of different routing protocols, 
when frequent link failure in network due to mobility of the 
nodes in the network. The performance analysis and simulation 
are carried out to evaluate network performance using Network 
Simulator (NS-2), based on the different load, node mobility, 
delay, packet sending rate and energy consumption. It has been 
verified through various simulations, which represent a wide 
range of network conditions that energy AODV deliver the better 
performance as that of the modern protocols DSDV, TORA, 
DSDV, DSR and AODV in terms of energy efficiency but it is 
observed that DSR needs significantly smaller energy overheads 
than other protocols.

I. INTRODUCTION 
A Network is a set of interconnected nodes. A mobile ad-hoc 
network [1, 2] is a network where there is no fixed 
infrastructure. All wireless facilitated devices within the range 
of each other can discover and communicate in a point-to-
 point approach without linking central access points [3]. 
Mobile ad networks and devices are becoming increasingly 
popular because they provide user access to information and 
communication anytime and anywhere. There is no need for 
router individually as each node can work as host as well as 
router accordingly. Each node or mobile device is prepared 
with a transmitter and receiver. The topology of mobile ad-hoc 
network is dynamic and depends upon the movement of the 
nodes accordingly it can change rapidly and unexpectedly. In 
exacting, a very large number of recent studies focused on 
Mobile Ad-hoc Networks (MANETs) [1, 4]. The performance 
analysis of a mobile ad-hoc network depends on the routing 
scheme employed, and the conventional routing protocols do 
not work efficiently in a MANET.  
In MANET Energy efficient routing protocols are the only 
solution to above circumstances. Most of the existing work of 
making protocols energy efficient has been done on “on 
demand routing protocols” because these protocols are more 
energy efficient rather than proactive protocols but still these 
have some problems which have been discussed in the next 
section. Energy efficiency can also be achieved by sensible 
flooding at the route discovery process in reverse reactive 
protocols [1, 4]. And energy efficiency routing can also be 
achieved by using efficient metric for route selection such as 
cost function, node energy, battery level etc.  
It presents a performance comparison of three well-known 
routing protocols in MANET, based on the result analysis 
obtained by running simulations with different scenarios in 
Network Simulator [1, 5]. The comparison was done based on 
the parameters, number of sources in the network, duration of 
pause times, maximum movement speed and sending rate to 
evaluate the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), Normalized 
Routing Load (NRL) and average end to end delay.  
To summarize, this paper is organized in 7 sections where 
Section 2 briefly describes routing protocols in MANET. In 
Section 3 describes the literature review of the existing 
protocols. In Section 4 describes the problem statement and 
briefly describes the protocols under consideration. In Section 
5 describes the methodology we followed to perform 
simulations. In Section 6 describes the simulations analysis, 
graph and results using mat lab. Finally, In Section 7 describes 
conclusion of simulation analysis result.

II. ROUTING PROTOCOL IN MANET
 Routing Protocol is used to find suitable routes between 
communicating nodes. They do not have use any access points 
to connect to other nodes. Routing protocols can be generally 
classified into 3 categories:-Centralized versus Distributed,-
 Static versus Adaptive, and Reactive versus Proactive [6, 7]. 
A. Proactive Protocols 
Proactive protocols are called table driven protocols in which, 
the route to all the nodes is maintained in routing table. 
Packets are transferred over the predefined route specified in 
the direction-finding table. In this scheme, the packet 
forwarding is done faster but the routing overhead is greater 
because all the routes have to be distinct before transferring 
the packets. Proactive protocols have lower latency because all 
the routes are maintained at all the times. For Example:
 DSDV, OLSR, WRP, CGSR, TBRPF [6, 7].
 B. Reactive (On-Demand ) Routing Protocols 
In this group of protocol there is an initialization of a route 
discovery mechanism by the source node to find the route to 
the destination node when the source node has data packets to 
send. When a route is found, the route preservation is initiated 
to maintain this route until it is no longer required or the 
destination is not reachable. The benefit of these protocols is 
that overhead messaging is reduced. One of the disadvantages
 of these protocols is the delay in discovering a new route. The 
different types of reactive routing protocols are Dynamic 
Source Routing (DSR), Ad-hoc On-Demand Distance Vector 
routing (AODV), and Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm 
(TORA) [7, 13].
 C. Hybrid  Routing Protocols 
A hybrid protocol means the combinations of reactive and 
proactive protocols and takes advantages of these two 
protocols and as a result, routes are found quickly in the 
routing zone. Example Protocol: ZRP. 
III. REVIEW OF EXISTING ROUTING PROTOCOLS
 In this section, we have brief review of the routing 
operations performed by the familiar protocols. DSDV, 
AODV, TORA, EAODV and DSR are discussed: 
A. Ad Hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) 
Protocol 
The Ad-hoc On-demand Distance Vector Routing (AODV) 
protocol is a reactive routing protocol for mobile ad hoc 
networks [8]. While a reactive routing protocol, AODV only 
needs to maintain the routing information about the active 
paths. In AODV, the routing information is upholder in the 
routing tables at all the nodes. Every mobile node maintains a 
next hop routing table, which contains the destinations to 
which it currently has a route. In AODV, when a source node 
desires to send packets to the destination but no route is 
available, it initiates a route discovery process. 
 In the route discovery process, the source node broadcasts 
route request (RREQ) packets which includes Destination 
Sequence Number. When the destination or a node that has a 
route to the destination receives the RREQ, it checks the 
destination sequence numbers it currently knows and the one 
particular in the RREQ. To assurance the freshness of the 
routing information, a route reply (RREP) packet is created 
and forwarded back to the source node only if the destination 
sequence number is equal to or greater than the one specified 
in RREQ. It uses only symmetric links and a RREP follows 
the reverse path of the respective RREQ. Upon receiving the 
RREP packet, each intermediate node along the route 
information updates its next-hop table entries with respect to 
the destination node. 
B. Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) Protocol 
Dynamic Source Routing (DSR) protocol [9, 10 and 15] is a 
reactive routing, on demand routing protocol based on the 
source routing. The source routing unimportantly allows 
routing of packets to be loop-free,it avoids the need for up-to-
 date routing information between different nodes and allows 
nodes that overhear packets containing routes to store this 
information for their own future use. A node that needs to send 
a packet to a destination checks in its route store if it has a 
route available. In a route discovery stage, a node sends the 
route request to the destination node. It reacts by the route 
reply than a path is established between the source and 
destination. Route maintenance phase , it indicates that the 
source route is broken; it can favor another route to reach the 
destination.
 C. Distance Sequence Distance Vector (DSDV) Protocol 
Destination Sequence Distance Vector (DSDV) is a proactive 
routing protocol and it is based on the distance vector 
algorithm. In table-driven routing protocols, each node 
constantly maintains up-to-date routes to every other node in 
the network. Routing information is periodically transmitted 
during the network in regulate to maintain routing table 
consistency. The routing table is updated at each node by 
finding the modify in routing information about all the 
available destinations with the number of nodes to that 
particular destination. As well, to provide loop freedom DSDV 
uses sequence numbers, which is provided, by the destination 
node. In case, if a route has already existed before traffic 
arrives, transmission occurs with no delay. In case of failure of 
a route to the next node, the node instantly updates the 
sequence number and broadcasts the information to its 
neighbors. When a node receives routing information then it 
ensures in its routing table. If it does not find such entry into 
the routing table then bring up to dates the routing table with 
routing information it has found. In case, if the node finds that 
it has already entry into its routing table then it compares with 
the sequence number of the received information with the 
routing table entry and updates the information [11].
 307
D. Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) 
Protocol: 
The Temporally Ordered Routing Algorithm (TORA) is a 
highly adaptive, well-organized and scalable distributed 
routing algorithm based on the thought of link reversal [17].
 TORA is proposed for highly self-motivated mobile, multi-
 hop wireless networks. It is a source-initiated on-demand 
routing protocol. It finds multiple routes from a source node to 
a destination node. The main characteristic of TORA is that 
the control messages are restricted to small set of nodes in the 
neighborhood of the occurrence of a topological change. To 
attain this, the nodes maintain routing information about 
adjacent nodes. The protocol has three basic functions: Route 
creation, Route maintenance and Route removal. TORA can 
undergo from unbounded worst-case convergence time for 
very stressful scenarios. TORA has a single feature of 
maintaining multiple routes to the destination so that 
topological changes do not require any reaction at all. The 
protocol responds only when all routes to the destination are 
lost.
 IV. PROBLEM STATEMENT 
A. Energy issues in Mobile  Ad-hoc networks: 
Ad-hoc networks have to suffer many challenges at the time of 
routing process. Dynamically changing topology and no 
unified infrastructure are the biggest challenges in the 
designing of an Ad hoc network.  If we compare it to the wired 
system then wireless network has less and more varying 
bandwidth, so bandwidth efficiency is also a major concern in 
Ad-hoc network routing protocols. It has Limited power 
supply is the biggest challenge of an Ad-hoc network so if we 
want to increase the network lifetime (time duration when the 
first node of the network runs out of power) as well the node 
lifetime then we must have an efficient energy organization 
protocol [18,19]. As a result an Ad-hoc routing protocol must 
meet all these challenges to give the average performance in 
every case. 
B. Energy Efficiency: 
In Mobile ad hoc network, all the devices generally operate on 
battery seek to track the energy efficiency heuristically by the 
reducing energy they have consumed, whereas maintaining 
suitable performance of certain works. Using the power 
consumption is not only a single decisive factor for deciding 
energy efficiency. In fact, energy efficiency be able to 
measured by the duration of the specific time over which the 
network can have maintain a certain performance stage, which 
is known as the network lifetime. Therefore routing 
information to increasing the lifetime of the certain network 
level is different from the lowest amount energy routing. 
Lowest amount energy routes [12] from time to time attract 
more flows, and the nodes in these routes enervate out their 
energy very soon; thus the whole network can’t perform any 
job due to the failure on these nodes. In the other words, the 
total energy consumed is balanced consumed along with all 
nodes in the networks. In general routing with highest lifetime 
stability all the routes and nodes globally maintain in 
consequence that the network performance level for a longer 
lifetime. Hence, energy efficiency is not only measured by the 
power consumption but in more common it can be measured 
by the duration of time over which the network can preserve a 
assured performance level.

 In addition, in order to examine the impact of movement speed 
on performances of routing protocols, we varied the maximum 
movement speed, while value of pause time and sending rate 
was kept unchanged. In that case, values of maximum 
movement speed range from 10 to 50 m/s, while pause time 
duration is 0 simulation seconds, and sending rate is 100 kbps. 
B. Performance Metrics :

successful a protocol is in delivering packets from source to 
destination in a network.

end delay of all successfully transmitted data packets from 
source to destination in a network. 
III. Normalized Routing Load (NRL): NRL is the ratio of 
the number of routing packets transmitted in a network. 
VI. RESULTS AND ANALYSIS
 In this section the comparison has done for the success rate 
and the energy consumption for the three routing algorithms 
over a wide variety of scenarios and traffic models resulting 
varying one of the three selected parameters i.e. node velocity, 
packet sending rate and pause time. 
6.1 Effect of PDR versus varying pause time, movement 
speed, sending rate.
 308
Obtained effects show characteristic differences in 
performance between considered routing protocols, which are 
the consequence of various mechanisms on which protocols 
are based. Although we carried out simulations with 10, 20 
and 30 sources, only results with 20 sources are presented in 
this paper. 
As in [1], “on-demand” routing protocols, EAODV, AODV 
and DSR, attain high values of PDR, which means they are 
efficient protocols from the point of delivering packets to their 
destination (Fig.1,Fig.2 and Fig.3). For EAODV, AODV and 
DSR protocols, PDR is self-governing of mobility and number 
of sources, while DSDV has approximately the same PDR 
under low mobility. Since DSDV protocol uses a “table 
driven” approach of maintaining routing information, it isn’t 
adaptive to the route changes that occur under high mobility as 
EAODV, AODV and DSR protocols are. As a result, DSDV 
and TORA protocol is not suitable for MANETs, because it is 
slow. Results obtained by running simulations with a 
changeable sending rate confirm the previous conclusion, but
 also show that all routing protocols don’t perform well when 
packet delivery ratio increases with respect to network load.
 Fig.1. Packet Delivery Ratio for Pause time
 Fig.2. Packet Delivery Ratio for Maximum movement speed
 Fig.3. Packet Delivery Ratio for sending rate
 6.2 Effect of Network Load versus varying pause time, 
movement speed, sending rate: 
On the other hand, in all considered cases, regardless of 
mobility, source number or network load, DSR and TORA 
protocol generates significantly less routing load than 
EAODV, AODV and DSDV protocols as Fig. 4, Fig.5 and 
Fig.6 shows. In high network load cases, nodes using 
considered routing protocols send more packets, thereby 
sending a larger number of routing packets.  
On the other hand, in high mobility cases, connection failures 
happen very often. Link failures initiate route discoveries in 
EAODV, AODV, since nodes have only one route per 
destination in their routing table. Thus, the frequency of route 
discovery in EAODV and AODV is straight comparative to 
the number of link failures. That is the reason why a major 
contribution to EAODV’s routing overhead comes from 
RREQ packets. On the other hand, reaction of DSR to 
connection failures in link is mild and sources route 
discoveries less often. The reason is plenty of cached routes at 
each node and prolongation of route discovery until all cached 
routes fail. That is the reason why RREQ packets don’t 
contribute so much to DSR’s routing overhead. A large 
contribution in DSR comes from RREP packets the node’s
 speed was chosen in the range 1-20 m/s and the packet send 
rate was gradually increased from 10 packets/s to 100 
packets/s and the other parameters remain the same as in the 
previous experiments. All algorithms are able to cope up with 
an increased load (see Fig.4), however, the performance of 
EAODV is the worst for packet delivery ratio and DSDV,
 TORA and DSR has similar packet delivery ratio. Fig. 6 
shows the effect of increasing the sending rate. This effect is 
analogous to the effect of increasing the number of source. All 
protocols present quite a steady behavior, the DSDV protocol 
merit to its table driven scheme, while on demand protocols 
thanks to their property of learning route information from 
previous packets.DSR shows lower value of routing load than 
EAODV and DSDV.

6.3 Effect of Average end to end delay versus varying 
pause time, movement speed, sending rate: 
Analyzing average end to end delay, we come to the end that 
DSR routing protocol out performs EAODV and DSDV 
protocols (Fig.7, Fig.8 and Fig.9), unlike the results acquired 
in [1], where EAODV protocol has the best performances. As
 supposed previously, for any network topology change, nodes 
that use EAODV protocol have to send RREQ packets. In 
other words, a route discovery process has been to be 
activated, because EAODV is a routing protocol that has no 
available route when needed. Since of inefficient route 
maintenance, average end to end delay is the largest for 
EAODV. On the other hand, DSDV and TORA protocol 
proactively holds routes to all destinations in its table, 
regardless of topology changes. However, DSR protocol has 
the best performances, because it doesn’t depend on periodical 
activities, and it uses source routing and route caching, but 
also maintains multiple routes per destination. It excels 
especially in low mobility scenarios, which means that in 
cases when network topology is stable, routes are not stale and 
that results in the best performances under consideration. 
  
Fig.7. Average End to End Delay for: a. Pause time
 Fig.8. Average End to End Delay for Maximum movement speed
 310
Fig.9. Average End to End Delay for sending rate 
When a network contains a small number of sources or node’s 
sending rate is low, EAODV and DSDV protocols have a 
similar average end to end delay as DSR, especially when 
node mobility is low. In that case, the network is less loaded. 
However, with source number or sending rate increasing, 
network load is increasing, and average end to end delay for 
all three protocols, especially EAODV and DSDV, becomes 
larger.
 6.4 Effect of Energy Consumption versus varying pause 
time, movement speed, sending rate:
 The energy consumption of the on-demand protocols increases as 
the maximum motion speed grows. As the movement speed 
moves from a humans walking MANET scenario to a road cars 
MANET, the DSR has lower energy per user data than EAODV 
and DSDV. When speed grows DSR performs better than 
EAODV, TORA and DSDV. 
The performance of EAODV is the worst for packet delivery ratio 
and DSDV, TORA and DSR has similar packet delivery ratio. 
Fig. 12 shows the effect of increasing the sending rate. This effect 
is analogous to the effect of increasing the number of source.  
Fig.10. Energy Consumption for Pause time
 Fig.11. Energy Consumption for Maximum movement speed
 Fig.12. Energy Consumption for Packet Sending rate
 All protocols present quite a stable behavior; some protocols are 
proactive and reactive scheme, while on demand protocols route 
information from preceding packets. DSR shows lower value of 
energy consumption than EAODV, TORA and DSDV. 
On average on-demand protocols (DSR, EAODV, and TORA)
 present an energy descendent trend as the motion rate drops, the 
table-driven protocol (DSDV) presents an energy consumption 
that remains practically constant as packet sending rate varies
 CONCLUSIONS
 Routing protocol DSDV uses proactive “table driven” routing, 
while EAODV, AODV, TORA and DSR use “on-demand” 
routing. DSDV protocol periodically updates its routing tables, 
even in cases when network topology doesn’t modify. EAODV 
protocol has inefficient route maintenance, because it has to 
initiate a route discovery process every time network topology 
changes. Both protocols, EAODV, TORA, AODV and DSR, 
use route discovery process, but with different routing 
mechanisms. In particular, EAODV and AODV protocol uses 
routing information into the tables, it use one route per each 
destination, and destination sequence numbers as a mechanism 
for determining freshness of routes and route loops prevention. 
311
On the other hand, DSR uses source routing and route caching, 
and doesn’t have depended on any periodic or time-based 
operations. In general, we can conclude that in low mobility 
and low load scenarios, all the protocols react in a similar way, 
while with mobility or load increasing DSR outperforms 
EAODV, AODV, TORA and DSDV routing protocols. Poor 
performances of TORA and DSR routing protocol, when 
mobility or load are increased, are the consequence of forceful 
use of caching and the lack of any system to expire out of date 
routes or establish the freshness of routes when several choices 
are available in the network. A central face is the development 
of the dynamic routing protocol that can efficiently and finds 
routes between two communication nodes. As well, in order to 
analyze and improve existing or new MANET routing 
protocols, it is desirable to examine other metrics like power 
consumption, fault tolerance, number of hops, jitter, etc. in 
various mobility and traffic models.
