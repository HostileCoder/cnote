 AbstractÑMachine-to-Machine (M2M) technology enables to
 interconnect machines with the least possible human intervention.
 The nature of M2M traffic, small and periodic, is different
 from the traditional traffic originating from computers or mobile
 phones, big and bursty. However, the number of nodes involved
 in such technology impacts the network as it has mainly been
 designed for Human-to-Machine (H2M) communications.
 Due to the number of involved M2M nodes and their intrinsic
 constraints, the retrieval of M2M traffic with existing networks
 is a real challenge. In order to do so, the authors propose a
 lightweight service announcement architecture, re-using already
 deployed Wi-Fi networks. This solution extends information
 announced in the IEEE 802.11 beacon frame. It enables M2M
 devices to automatically detect the most appropriate network
 among the one discovered, reduces the amount of signaling
 messages exchanged to do so and consequently, the delay needed
 to collect this traffic.
 The feasibility study, based on real-world data, shows that the
 frequency of announcement, the amount of data to send and the
 available density of Access Points, have to be taken into account
 in order to use Wi-Fi networks to retrieve M2M traffic.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 The Machine-to-Machine (M2M) technology paradigm is
 built around the principle of interconnection of machines
 with the least possible human intervention. The data traffic
 generated by these new M2M applications is generally quite
 different from the ÒclassicalÓ Human-to-Machine (H2M) tech-
 nologies.
 M2M communications usually generate less traffic per node
 than computers or mobile phones, but impact the network
 design since the number of nodes is much higher. For instance
 neither 3G, nor even LTE networks alone can be used to
 interconnect all potential M2M endpoints. In fact, Po¬tsch et
 al. [9] showed that even the considered small M2M traffic can
 increased delay on best effort H2M traffic in LTE network.
 In addition, M2M nodes, that can be mobile, are sleeping
 most of the time and wake up either when an event occurs
 to send some information, or periodically to check if some
 request has arrived from the network. The low-volume per
 endpoint, periodic, energy-, resource-, and cost- efficient nature
 of the M2M traffic is in stark contrast to the high-volume
 per endpoint, bursty nature of the H2M communications.
 It is thus of crucial importance to take the intrinsic M2M
 traffic characteristics in the design of future communication
 architectures, and whenever possible Ð adapt and optimize the
 existing ones.
 Wi-Fi coverage is high in densely populated areas such as
 cities as shown in [1], but can be subject to traffic limitations
 for data exchange. A new concept which has been gaining
 popularity in the recent years is the sharing of Wi-Fi con-
 nectivity among the members of a given group Ð Community
 Networks (CN). As an example, all major ISP providers in
 France offer to their customers the possibility to participate
 to ISP-wide CNs [2], which given the significant high-speed
 Internet penetration rate provides an almost ubiquitous access.
 FON1 offers the same kind of services in many countries such
 as U.K. or Japan. It is important to note that this type of service
 is different from the Òfree-for-allÓ, open Wi-Fi networks, as
 well as the ones provided by local businesses for their clients
 (e.g. a hotel providing the password to their guests). Indeed, in
 these scenarios it is difficult to comply with the regulations in
 different countries (e.g. identifying a user for legal purposes),
 but also to be able to guarantee acceptable performance to
 the users of the network, and most importantly Ð for security
 reasons. As a consequence, the CNs are built around the notion
 of Virtual Wireless ISP (VW-ISP) where a dedicated, well
 known Wi-Fi SSID (Service Set IDentification) is announced
 by every participating Access Point (AP) in addition to the
 user-defined one. The ISP provides credentials (typically user
 name and password, but can also be based on certificates, etc.)
 to its clients which allow them to connect to the VW-ISP.
 The core of this paper is to define and study a new
 application of the VW-ISP approach. We propose a new way
 to announce services in IEEE 802.11 beacons frame and so, to
 re-use existing Wi-Fi architecture for M2M communications.
 This is an adaptation of the ISP CNs to M2M applications
 and Ð as we show through the paper Ð does not require
 any modification to the existing hardware. Once again, it is
 important to stress that the classical VW-ISP approach cannot
 be reused as-is for M2M communications as it relies on typical
 H2M characteristics.
 The solution we propose uses the possibility to include
 extensions to the information announced in IEEE 802.11 bea-
 cons. We detail the service announcement mechanism and its

 role in a generic, M2M service oriented architecture. Our pro-
 posal is evolutionary technology-wise, and opens new horizons
 for business applications. We introduce the role of Wi-Fi M2M
 Service Provider (WM-SP), where an ISP can leverage its
 existing infrastructure to generate additional revenue sources,
 and in the same time create an enabler for new M2M services.
 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time this concept
 is studied in detail.
 The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The related
 work is presented in Section II. The M2M service provider
 architecture is then introduced in Section III. We perform a
 feasibility study of the proposed architecture in Section IV
 followed by the conclusion of this paper in Section V.
 II. RELATED WORK
 Deployment of M2M devices or sensors in our everyday life
 is increasing [7]. The traffic generated by these devices is dif-
 ferent from the traditional traffic originating from a computer
 or a mobile phone. In fact, nodes are mainly sleeping, only
 waking up to send collected data or to check for incoming
 requests. Collecting these data is an issue to be solved due to
 the intrinsic constraint of these devices and their significant
 growths prevent from using existing architecture as-is such as
 cellular network.
 Solutions exist such as the one offered by the company
 SigFox which introduces a beaconless unidirectional access
 to the IMS band for M2M applications2. However, in this
 technology, the data retrieval is performed via an Aloha-style
 mechanism. The long radio range and the energy constraints
 makes the bandwidth available very limited for applications.
 Additionally, Kleinrock et al. [6] discussed slotted-Aloha sta-
 bility problem and showed that Ð for large number of terminals
 Ð the channel can get saturated. Furthermore, this solution
 requires the deployment of a new and dedicated cellular
 network. Even though the technology enables to cover larger
 area, the Access Network (AN) should be updated accordingly
 to the growing number of such devices.
 Density of Wi-Fi access network is increasing. It has been
 so much expanding this past years that several research studies
 have been conducted to define new ways to benefit from the
 existing wireless deployment such as in [8]. This deployed AN
 could be used to retrieve M2M traffic since it offers much more
 point of attachment to the network than any other solutions,
 and a sufficient enough bandwidth. One problem being to
 determine which APs support a M2M data collecting service
 among all the available APs. Solutions such as IEEE 802.21
 and IEEE 802.11u help to inform about the AN capabilities.
 Both of them could then be used in the discovery of services
 availability on APs. However, with such protocols, nodes have
 to exchange additional messages in order to gather the informa-
 tion about the different networks. This information gathering
 need to take place prior to the selection and connection to the
 candidate AN. In fact, nodes cannot spend time connecting to
 an AP that will not be able to fulfill their goal Ð transferring
 M2M data. Nodes have then to process information from all
 surrounding APs to select the most suitable one for their
 2http://www.sigfox.com/en/

 use. Which once again, is a loss in term of awake time,
 signaling exchange and energy consumption Ð and this, each
 time they have to send information. In fact, the signaling
 message exchanged in IEEE 802.21 represent 22% of the total
 transmission time on the device side [4]. Worst of all, most of
 this time is spent for the retrieval of information regarding the
 AP capabilities.
 The Wi-Fi M2M Service Provider (WM-SP) approach we
 introduce in this paper is based on a new way to announce
 services supported by Wi-Fi networks. In addition to limiting
 the amount of exchanged and processed information, our
 proposal decreases the time needed to select the correct AN
 and therefore the time needed to send data. This is in stark
 contrast to the alternative approaches. To the best of our
 knowledge, this is the first time the WM-SP concept is defined
 and studied in the light of lightweight service announcement
 via Wi-Fi beacon options.
 III. SERVICE-CENTERED ARCHITECTURE
 In this paper we will be using the terms ÒserviceÓ and ÒM2M
 serviceÓ interchangeably. We will concentrate on services that
 need to be deployed in areas where Wi-Fi coverage (residen-
 tial and/or public) is already assured through one or more
 networks. The transport of M2M traffic will be ensured by
 re-using the existing networks, each provider deciding which
 services to enable on its network. M2M devices have then to
 be able to discover the services available on each surrounding
 Wi-Fi networks.
 A. Principle
 We propose a solution that overcomes issues of existing
 protocol to gather and transfer data generated by M2M devices.
 In order to do so, the solution (i) re-uses existing Wi-Fi
 networks, (ii) advertises about available services as soon as
 possible without increasing the amount of message exchanged
 and (iii) enables M2M nodes to transfer their data as fast as
 possible.
 Figure 1 presents a schematic view of current Wi-Fi network
 deployment in cities. APs are set up by different providers to
 offer wireless Internet access. However, as it often depends
 on the willingness of their customers, providers do not have
 2
3
 an uniform coverage. Additionally, devices cannot access the
 Internet via any APs, as they need proper credentials (lo-
 gin/password, a key) to connect to it. This high protection
 prevents from using Wi-Fi networks for other uses.
 Our idea is to enable multiple services on subsets of APs
 Ð possibly belonging to different ISPs Ð to ensure an uniform
 coverage. Each APs will have its legacy usage, provide Internet
 access to users who have the appropriate credentials, and at the
 same time, offer a ÒrestrictedÓ access for other usages. Subsets
 of network will then propose additional support for services
 that would be advertised by the corresponding APs.
 For instance, in Fig. 1, a subset of APs (marked with a
 circle) offers a service to collect data coming from energy plug
 Ð a connected power plug monitoring the energy consumption.
 These APs advertise in the beacons their support for this ser-
 vice. Then, this announce allows energy plugs to differentiate
 the APs and detect the ones supporting this service (and which
 will enable them to send the monitored data), from the rest.
 Once a plug is paired with one AP, it transmits its data to
 the AP that will forward them via tunneling mechanism to the
 correct destination, represented by the server in the top-right
 of Fig. 1.
 To achieve this goal, an AP has to advertise the services
 it supports and forward M2M traffic in addition to its main
 use Ð providing Internet to standard users. These mechanisms
 are simple to set up as shown in Section III-C. In addition,
 it enables to adapt the periodicity of service advertisement
 depending on the importance given to the service.
 B. Announcing support for M2M services
 Service advertisement mechanism is required in order to
 enable the M2M devices to automatically detect which services
 are available on a network when the network is discovered.
 Additionally, the service availabilities must be discoverable
 without having to associate to the network. Our proposal
 ensures these two requirements while avoiding to exchange
 several messages with the AP and being able to discard
 networks that do not support the desired service. In order to
 do so, we propose a solution based on existing messages that
 are already present in the legacy networks.
 During the discovery phase, devices receive periodic mes-
 sages (beacons) from APs. These messages contains different
 information regarding the Wi-Fi network for the devices to
 connect to it. Our proposal consists in adding to the Vendor-
 Specific field of the beacon (or probe-response) frame an
 option tag describing the services supported by the network.
 M2M nodes can use this information to determine which Wi-
 Fi networks are worth connecting to. Contrary to traditional
 Wi-Fi networks, active probing may be too expensive energy-
 wise for a battery-operated M2M device looking for a specific
 service. For that reason, in this paper we will limit our study
 to passive probing. It is important, however, to stress that the
 active probing mechanism is in complete accordance with our
 architecture.
 Each service is represented with an unique identifier (ID).
 The tag included in the beacon will thus contain as much IDs
 as supported services. However, this tag should also contain
 some specific information additionally to the available ser-
 vices. In fact, we believe it can be essential to have information
 on the providers deploying the service (e.g. the WM-SP). So,
 tags should as well contain a provider ID (WM-SP ID). Thus,
 provider-specific nodes can ignore all other providers except
 the one they belong to.
 This tag ensures that devices discover the available services
 supported by each Wi-Fi networks at the same time they dis-
 cover them. There is no additional message exchange needed
 for this discovery phase and the tag should be small enough to
 not overload beacons. Devices can ignore APs not supporting
 the service they require. Finally, devices that do not base
 their network selection on the service availability can simply
 ignore this option, e.g. this mechanism is entirely backward
 compatible.
 Depending on the delay tolerance of the service, the tag can
 be set in each beacon or every n beacons. For instance, critical
 services such as an health monitoring, will be advertised in
 all beacons of a given AP. This Òbeacon hopÓ increases the
 probability for critical services to be discovered. Moreover, this
 advertisement period enables to have more services advertised
 while bypassing the tag size issue Ð since there will be a
 shifting in the advertised services. With this solution, adding
 a new service advertisement in the beacon is simple as it only
 requires to add the new service ID into the advertised services.
 C. Support for M2M traffic retrieval
 1) At the Access Point level: In this architecture, AP has to
 have a different behavior. In fact, M2M traffic has to be routed
 specifically as shown in Fig. 2. APs will have to manage data
 flows coming from M2M communications in addition to its
 main activity, i.e. providing Internet access. AP will also have
 to manage the tag announced in its beacon messages. AP will
 have a configuration mechanism listing all the services it has
 to announce and their parameters, such as the advertisement
 periodicity, the service ID and the level of authentication
 needed.
 When the AP receives M2M traffic, it has to transfer it
 to the corresponding destination. One of the possibilities is
 to construct Virtual Private Networks (VPN) upon request. In
 addition, if authentication is needed between the AP and M2M
 nodes, APs will have to manage service authentication keys.
 There are a lot of possibilities described in the literature, such
 as based on pre-shared keys (distributed or centralized), or
 based on a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). In any case, the
 specific mechanism can be known in advance (configured for
 each service). We consider this question, albeit essential, out of
 scope for our study and we assume the nodes are authenticated
 via an appropriate mechanism, such as based on IEEE 802.1X.
 2) At the node level: Device will have a different behavior
 since they need to take into account this service announcement.
 In fact, devices will have to check for the presence of a
 service tag in the beacons. Devices should therefore be able
 to understand this tag and compare the expected service ID
 to the ones advertised in beacons. Once a matching WM-SP
 is found, the device has to authenticate to the AP and send
 the corresponding data using the IP address allocated by the
 3

 AP or the one assigned prior to its deployment. Indeed, M2M
 nodes can be deployed with a pre-assigned IP address. This
 pre-assignment will avoid having to retrieve the IP address
 from the AP and gain time usually used to do so for retrieving
 M2M data.
 IV. FEASIBILITY STUDY
 The WM-SP architecture described in Section III relies on
 current standard technologies and provides new communi-
 cation paradigm for M2M devices. In order to demonstrate
 that the principle is indeed valid, we performed a feasibility
 study in a specific use case. We considered the case of a
 monitoring service, which could be monitoring the activity
 and position of a pet or monitoring someoneÕs health (both
 examples having a different level of criticality). Thus, a device
 is monitoring some physical characteristic and sending the
 measurements whenever it is under a Wi-Fi coverage that
 support its monitoring service.
 The device is mobile, moving inside an area alternating
 between ÒwithÓ and ÒwithoutÓ Wi-Fi coverage. Even when it is
 under Wi-Fi coverage it may not be able to send its data as the
 corresponding AP may not support the service it is looking for,
 or the devices may be sleeping when it receives the beacon.
 The goal here is to study the influence of the advertisement
 frequency on the time to discover the supported services and
 the influence of the Wi-Fi density on the performance.
 A. Mathematical modeling of a M2M monitoring service
 The aforementioned service can be represented by a three
 states Markov chain:
 ¥ State 0: the device is not under Wi-Fi coverage;
 ¥ State 1: the device is under Wi-Fi coverage but has not
 received a beacon with the expected tag;
 ¥ State 2: the device is under Wi-Fi coverage and has
 received a beacon with the expected tag.
 We consider that if the device is under Wi-Fi coverage,
 it leaves the corresponding state after a delay following an
 exponential law with rate µ. Transitioning from non-covered
 to covered region is done with rate ?. In order to make the
 problem mathematically tractable, we consider that beacons
 are sent following a Poisson law with a rate ?. If we denote
 with p the probability that the device is sleeping, this Markov
 chain can be illustrated as shown in Fig. 3.
 As the studied scenario is a continuous-time Markov chain
 with fixed number of states, the generator matrix, Q, can be

 Let pit(i) represent the probabilities to be in the state i,
 while Pt represent the transition state matrix. If we note
 ?t = (pit(0), pit(1), pit(2)) then
 ?t = ?0 á Pt = ?0 á eQát (2)
 As mentioned previously, we are interested in knowing the
 time necessary to receive an appropriate tag, i.e. to arrive
 in state 2. After computation, pit(2) can be reduced to the
 following expression :
 pit(2) = 1? K1e?At2 ? K2e?Bt2 (3)

 Values for ? and µ have to be determined in order to
 complete this model and study their influence on the delay
 needed to discover the services.
 B. Determining values for this modeling
 In order to instantiate the aforementioned Markov chain,
 we use real world data that characterize Wi-Fi deployment.
 Wi2Me [3] is an Android-based research application that has
 been developed to build Wi-Fi APs map and automate Wi-Fi
 connection. This tool also allows evaluating the availability
 and performance of CNs.
 1) Methodology: Wi2Me application uses active probing to
 discover Wi-Fi networks and then connects to the AP with
 the highest signal level. It continues scanning the different
 channels and if it finds a network with a better signal level, will
 then attempt to connect to it. Then, aside from its original aim,
 Wi2Me enables to determine the Wi-Fi network density, since
 it stores results of all the scans performed while the application
 is running. Guidec et al. [5] used Wi2Me in a field trial for
 testing a disruption-tolerant application in a rural area. Wi2Me
 has also been extensively used in the city of Rennes (France),
 where volunteers have walked around the city in order to

 determine the density of Wi-Fi networks and the quality of
 connection [2]. In both cases, volunteers were equipped with
 a device running Wi2Me application. They walked around the
 desired area and repeated this process several times following
 different path. Table I presents the main values extracted from
 these two trials.
 2) Field trial data: Table I shows that in the first (resp.
 second) case, the device is connected to an AP on average
 during 44.7sec (resp. 25.57sec). The average time between two
 connections (not covered) is 53.9sec (resp. 9.9sec). Finally,
 Wi2Me has discovered 45 (resp. 7280) distinct APs during the
 trial.
 We noticed that the average time under Wi-Fi coverage is
 almost the double in the first trial (in the rural area) than in
 the second trial. This difference can be explained since the
 environments between a city center and a rural area are com-
 pletely different. In fact, there is less shadowing in the rural
 area, as for instance there are less objects obstructing signals
 propagation. But the average time without Wi-Fi coverage is
 almost 5 times higher in the first trial, which is mainly due to
 the low number of discovered AP in this area.
 3) Values obtained: Data collected by this application dur-
 ing these trials allows us determining the average time during
 when a device is (resp. not) under Wi-Fi coverage. The
 behavior of device running Wi2Me application is simple, it
 connects to an AP when possible or is waiting to discover APs.
 With the notation of Fig. 3, when the device running Wi2Me
 application is (resp. not) under Wi-Fi coverage, i.e. connected
 to the corresponding AP, it leaves the corresponding state after
 a delay following an exponential law with rate µ (resp. ?).
 Hence, the average time under (resp. without) Wi-Fi cov-
 erage is 1/µ (resp. 1/?). Values for µ (resp. ?) can then be
 computed regarding the average connected (resp. waiting for
 connection) time retrieved from Wi2Me measurement for these
 two trials. And the Wi-Fi coverage is then given by ??+µ .
 In order to study the impact of better covered areas on the
 performance, other values for ? and µ, stated as case 3 and
 4 in Table II, have been estimated based on a basic cross-
 multiplication. This new values enable to represent the case of
 cities with higher Wi-Fi density, i.e. with an higher percentage
 of Wi-Fi coverage. All these values (computed and estimated)
 are summarized in the Table II.
 C. Results and analysis
 1) Influence of advertisement period: The frequencies at
 which a service is advertised within the beacon depend on
 the importance given to a service. We studied the influence of
 the advertisement period over the delay needed to discover the
 service. Here, the probability pit(2) is fixed, just as the values
 of ? and µ for which, in the following results, we used the

 values obtained in the case 2 of Table II. We also considered
 that the device is always awake Ð p = 1.
 1/? represents the advertisement period and t the time
 needed to receive the expected tag (i.e. state 2 on Fig. 3).
 The influence of ? (on the abscissa) on the time t (on the
 ordinate) can then be plotted as shown on Fig. 4. Each curves
 represent different values for pit(2), the probability that the
 time to receive the appropriate tag is lower than t. For instance,
 the point marked with solid black lines on Fig. 4 shows that
 the device has a probability of 99% to receive the expected tag
 in less than 37 seconds for a service advertised every second.
 We can conclude that:
 ¥ The delay needed to receive an appropriate tag has a
 limit when ? tends to infinite (i.e. period tends to 0);
 ¥ This delay is growing exponentially for period greater
 than 1s;
 ¥ As expected, the higher the success rate, the higher the
 delay;
 ¥ For case 2, the advertisement period cannot be higher
 than 2.5 sec, otherwise delay needed to receive an
 appropriate tag becomes higher than the average covered
 time (dashed black line);
 ¥ And for the same reason, it is not likely to have services
 with a success rate > 0.95 for this specific density.
 2) Influence of AP density: In this section, we explored
 the influence of AP density over the performance of our
 architecture. We fixed the value of ? and see the influence of ?
 and µ, i.e. the average time with and without Wi-Fi coverage,

 on the time t to receive an appropriate tag. To do so, we used
 the values presented in Section IV-B and listed in Table II. The
 influence of the density over the delay t is plotted in Fig. 5.
 As expected, the delay needed to receive the expected tag
 is lower in denser area, i.e. with a greater ?. However, the
 case 1 (in rural area) presents better results (cf. dashed line
 in Fig. 5) than cases 2 and 3 (city center) for a success rate
 lower than 0.9. But, for success rate higher than 0.9, results of
 case 1 are deteriorating drastically. This should be taken into
 consideration since the time without Wi-Fi coverage in the
 rural area is too high to enable a constant high probability of
 successfully receive a beacon. Thus, depending on the desired
 success rate, study on the available Wi-Fi density has to be
 performed before deploying a service.
 3) Probability to successfully send data: In this monitoring
 scenario, being able to receive the appropriate tag is not
 the most important. In fact, the goal for the device is to
 successfully send the collected data. With the Markov chain
 depicted in Fig. 3, the probability to send data before leaving
 the current Wi-Fi area is the following:
 P = e?µáÆ (4)
 where Æ is the time needed to send the data. For an IEEE
 802.11b Wi-Fi network, the typical throughput is around
 6Mbit/s. We can re-use values measured during the trial
 performed in [5] to illustrate the data transmission part. The
 data produced by a wireless Electrocardiogram (ECG) shim-
 mer sensor is around 16kB every 20sec. For this example, Æ
 is then equal to 21.33ms. Such sensors need 21.33ms to send
 their data every 20 sec. In the case 2, the probability for this
 sensor to send its data before leaving the Wi-Fi coverage is
 P = e?0.8532á10?3 = 0.99. Therefore, in 99% of the time and
 for this density, this specific device will always successfully
 send its data before leaving the current coverage. And since it
 only needs 21.33ms to transfer the data, the sensor will still
 be able to do it, even with a service advertisement period from
 100ms to up to 2 seconds.
 Thus, it is possible to use such a mechanism to collect M2M
 traffics via existing Wi-Fi networks. However, the advertise-
 ment period of each services depend on the density of APs
 offering these services and on the size of data to send.
 V. CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES
 In this paper, we presented a lightweight service announce-
 ment architecture and studied its properties in the context of
 Wi-Fi networks. Specifically, we analyzed the possibility of re-
 using existing Wi-Fi networks for M2M communications. Wi-
 Fi networks are a good alternative to cellular network and will
 inevitably be impacted by the M2M traffic. We demonstrated
 that depending on the importance given to a service, the density
 of Wi-Fi networks is often sufficient to enable the retrieval
 of M2M data. The results are based on mathematical model
 of the proposed architecture which allow for a close-form
 solution. The model has been parametrized with real-world
 data collected in several war-driving campaigns.
 We plan to extend our study in several directions. The
 impact of a large number of M2M nodes within a specific
 coverage of Wi-Fi networks is the next step. In fact, contrary
 to cellular networks the high amount of APs enable to balance
 the nodes among them. The effectiveness of announcing avail-
 able services through beacons should also be studied through
 simulation of the deployment of a critical service, such as an
 health monitoring service. These simulations will enable to
 compare this solution and its performance with others.
