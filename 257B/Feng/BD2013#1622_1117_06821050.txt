Abstract—Computer crime investigation and forensics is an 
important research work to combat criminal activity in 
cyberspace. But the complexity of computer criminal groups 
makes the computer crime forensics to be a challenge. Email is 
an important communication mean in computer crime 
communication. So the email forensics is needed to organized 
crime. This paper proposed an email forensics method based 
on graph clustering method and social network analysis (SNA). 
We analyze and mine emails data of the suspicious users’ 
accounts using the new method, which can create email 
communication network graph for suspicious computer 
criminal organizations. The algorithm developed can analyze 
computer organization’s structure and core members. The 
effectiveness of the method proposed has been proved by our 
experimental data and results. The research may help 
investigators to find more email evidence and case clues and 
improve investigators’ email forensic capability, especially to 
the investigation for organized crime.  
Keywords—email forensics; organized crime; social network 
analysis(SNA); betweenness centrality; core member 
I. INTRODUCTION
 In recent years, the computer network crime activities 
are more and more, which bring great threat to network 
security. How to fight against computer crime effectively is 
a major concern of society. As an important means to 
combat computer crime, digital forensics (also known as 
computer forensics) has become to be an important 
component for the investigation and forensics of criminal 
cases, especially in cases related to computer crimes. 
Now email becomes to be one important mean of daily 
network communications. At the same time, email has also 
become be a tool for computer crime. Members of a criminal 
organization can contact with each other by email. So the 
investigation and evidence collection of email data is an 
important task for computer forensics analysis.  
We mainly study the organized crime investigation for 
email forensics. In this paper, we proposed a method to 
achieve email forensics based on social network analysis 
(called SNA). The main goal is to find the relationship 
communication network corresponding to a criminal 
organization. Furthermore we study the structure of Criminal 
organization to identify core members and the relationship 
between them. In this way, we may be able to find more 
evidence clues data to provide more digital evidence. 
II. RELATED WORK TO COMPUTER FORENSICS
 To combat computer crime, digital forensics becomes to 
be an important research task. FBI of United States of 
laboratory set up computer forensics lab in 1984. In 1993, 
the first International Conference on computer forensics held. 
The IOCE (International Organization on Computer 
Evidence) was founded in 1995. Then many countries 
promulgated laws and regulations related to digital evidence 
and digital forensics, specially set up their government 
computer forensics departments.  
Many famous information security companies and 
organizations successfully developed excellent products for

computer forensics. These products include 
Encase(Guidance company), FTK(AccessData company), 
X-Way(Germany X-ways company), Oxygen(Russian 
Oxygen company) and FBI Forensic Desktop (Australian 
Nuix company),etc. Some digital forensics tools also include 
email forensic analysis function. The existing email forensic 
functions mainly focus on the basic processes modules 
including email data collecting, email decoding and simple 
relationship graph drawing.  
III. FORENSIC ANALYSIS OF ORGANIZED CRIME
 After 911 events in United States, all national 
governments come to realize the significance for prevention 
and control of organized crime. If you ignore the purpose of 
their actions, organized crime network and other common 
social groups have the same structural characteristics. 
Members in a group and their communication relationships 
can be seen as the basic units of social network. To prevent 
and combat"organized crime, we not only should explore the 
characteristics and behavior of the criminal, but also analyze 
the gang organization and its structure, especially core 
members of it.  
If the forensic analysis work of criminal organization 
primarily uses manual analysis, so data collection, storage, 
analysis and visualization would spend a lot of manpower 
and material resources. Social network analysis tool makes 
forensic analysis of criminal organization into intelligence 
analysis phase. We use social network analysis methods and 
tools to gain insight into the structure and organization mode 
of the criminal organization.  
Social network analysis is used to analyze these 
networks effective theory and methods. Social network 
analysis can provide a set of norms and methods to analyze 
the structure of social relations and their properties in a 
social group. SNA method can be used to study forensic 
analysis of organized crime. Thereby the results can more 
effectively guide the administration of justice with technical 
means.
 There is a lot of research work for the analysis of social 
groups based on SNA. Hisato Tashiro [1] studied the method 
for finding leadership in e mail network using betweenness 
and in-degree network centralities [2] and PageRank. Haibo 
Wang [3] proposed an algorithm to detect the community 
structure in weighted email networks by deleting all the 
boundaries. In order to measure how much an edge could be 
a boundary between two communities, a composite index 
named mediumness is defined, which is derived from 
betweenness centrality. Many researchers studied the small 
groups and their structure in communication network, like 
[4,5]. In complex network research works, many researchers 
also use centrality method analyzed the structure of complex 
networks, and identify an important member of small group, 
like [6,7,8,9]. 
Some research work for criminal network analysis based 
on SNA occurred. The main contents of organized crime 
forensics based SNA method include the modeling of 
criminal organizations, computing organizational size, 
analyzing organizational structure, finding membership 
composition and identifying suspicious targets.  
Jennifer Xu [10] developed a criminal network 
intelligence analysis system (called CrimeNet Explorer), 
which consists of four parts: network creating, network 
segmentation, structural analysis and network visualization. 
This system uses a variety of advanced technologies, 
including the concept space methods and social network 
analysis methods, which can automatically analyze the 
number of criminal gangs in a criminal network and identify 
core criminal members.  
Matthew J [11] and his team members developed a tool 
to build network structure of terrorist organizations (called   
NETEST) based Bayesian reasoning. Using the software, 
investigators can accurately analyze the scale of the entire 
criminal networks, membership, organizational structure, 
operational capabilities and its subgroups. The tool improves 
the intelligence analysis capabilities to help investigators 
make the right court judgments, thus effectively combat 
terrorism and destroy terrorist organizations. 
Arizona State University Black Cyber Terrorism 
Research Center [12] studied extremist groups using social 
network analysis tools. They analyzed the activities of 

 564
terrorist organizations in online forums and built social 
networks and organizational structure. 
IV. EMAIL FORENSIC SNALYSIS FRAMEWORK
 Current research work related to criminal organization 
communication contact focus on email communications 
content analysis, such as EMT and MET. The two tools 
mainly analyze the message traffic and mine message 
subject to provide decision support to investigations. 
Another scholar proposed a method to mine sensitive 
content and message subject to identity message 
authentication using support vector machine learning 
methods [13]. But these research work for email forensics is 
not involved the entire system framework. It is hard to 
achieve comprehensive email forensic work without system 
framework. So study of the framework for email forensics is 
important to email evidence investigation. Rachid 
Hadjidj[14] designed and implemented a comprehensive 
software toolkit called IEFAF to assist investigators gather 
clues and evidence in an investigation forensics for email 
communication. The framework offers several 
functionalities including email storing, editing, searching, 
querying and email account localization. The IEFAF 
achieves a static forensics and analysis for email 
communication and has a good practical significance. But 
IEFAF tool can not achieve a complex mail network 
association analysis. 
In literature [15], John Haggerty posited a framework for 
the forensic investigation of email data, focusing on the 
triage and analysis of unstructured data to identify key actors 
and relationships within an email network. The researchers 
demonstrated the applicability of the approach by applying 
relevant stages of the framework to the Enron email corpus. 
The work is only for a specific case, but no complete 
theoretical framework.  
Based on existing frameworks, this paper proposes a new 
email forensic analysis framework to solve the email 
dynamic relationship analysis, especially in email 
communication relationship and structure analysis. The new 
framework also achieves static forensics and analysis for 
email communication.  
The new framework of the email forensic work is as 
Figure 1.  
"
 Figure. 1. Email forensics framework 
The main work of framework includes email decoding, 
attributes extracting, searching, email communication 
network graph generating, data filtering, email clustering, 
finding suspect criminal organization and identifying core 
members of criminal organization.  
According to this framework, we collect email data from 
mail clients (e.g. Foxmail, a Chinese version of the email 
client software). Different clients may use different mail 
storage file format and email accounts organizational 
methods. We need to find the relationship between email 
data files and email accounts. But also we need to separate 
out every single email from one email account. So we can 
get all the user message data. According to different mail 
protocol format specification (e.g. MIME, UUencode and 
Binhex), we can decode all messages. 
For each email message, we can extract its attributes be 
required for email forensics, and store email attributes into 
the MySQL database. These attributes mainly include from
 address, to address, cc, subject, received, date, etc. Using 
these attributes, we can study and discover the relationships 
between multiple email accounts. And also the investigator 
is able to retrieve the specified email relevant to the case. 
Next we construct a relationship graph of email 
accounts’ communications, in which the vertices represent 

 565
email account and a directed edge is established from a node 
with from address to another node with to address. The 
number of email between from address and to address is as 
the value of corresponding edge. 
In the email forensics framework, it is important to find 
criminal organizations and their core members. We proposed 
filtering algorithm and clustering algorithm for email 
network graph, which help us to analyze email network 
structure and obtain more forensic clues.  
The following sections of this paper describe several 
important functional modules for email forensics 
framework.  
V. EMAIL NETWORK GRAPH GENERATING
 For original email data set, we first have to apply 
subject-based and content-based filtering methods (e.g. 
Bayesian algorithm) to retrieve related messages for 
specified cases by investigator. Then it due to store 
messages data needed for email forensics.  
For these email data, it is a basic development work to 
construct the email communication network graph. With this 
email network graph, we can further study the criminal 
organizations and their core members.  
In order to show the relationship between the 
communication relations more directly, we realize email 
communication network graphic using extended JUNG[16] 
framework.  
JUNG is a software package and a support tool Java 
library. We extend the JUNG framework and use it to design 
an email relationship graph and its operation algorithms.  
The steps of realizing the visualization of email 
relationship network graph are as follows: 
1) Initialize graph G and adding vertices and edges; 
2) Create a Layout objects for the corresponding graph: 
Layout<String, String> layout = new CircleLayout(g); 
3) Create a VisualizationViewe object; 
VisualizationViewer<String,String>vv=new 
VisualizationViewer<String, String> (layout); 
4) A visual object vv is placed in a container object and 
displayed. Thus, the network diagram of graph G can be 
drawled in the window. 
The network graph G is a directed graph. Here each 
vertex represents an email account; an edge represents an 
email communication. An edge can be given a value which 
is the number of email communication. Using the email 
network graph, we can clearly identify and analyze the 
communication relationship between email accounts. 
An email communication network graph is as follows 
Figure.2. Here we choose the 500 emails of the CCERT 
Dataset (a Chinese email dataset).  
"
 Figure. 2. An email network graph 
From Figure 2, it shows the correspondence of email 
accounts. By dynamically selecting a special email account 
and dragging it to the appropriate location, we can identify 
the communication relationship the special account and the 
others more clearly. 
VI. FILTERING METHOD BASED ON MINIMUM TRAFFIC
 In a suspected criminal gangs, if the value of an edge is 
smaller, it shows the relationship of two email accounts be 
connected with the edge is not very close. In the case, given 
a communication threshold, if the value of an edge is less 

 566
than the specified communication threshold, we delete the 
edge. Then that we can keep the email accounts vertexes be 
linked closely related to crime group.  
The communication network graph of Figure 2 can be 
processed to the result as shown in Figure 3. Here the value 
of communication threshold is 100. In the process, we have 
deleted some redundant edges and related email account 
vertexes. As shown, the visual test result is clearer.  
"
 Figure. 3. Email network graph after filtering 
From Figure 3, we can find the email accounts of more 
traffic. But it can be ignored the email accounts have 
complex communication relationship and some email 
accounts be concerned may be deleted. If there is such a case, 
it is difficult to find the real suspicious accounts. In order to 
find more complex communication relationship in email 
network, we need to use more effective clustering method. 
VII. CLUSTERING ANALYSIS OF EMAIL NETWORK GRAPH
 BASED ON MINIMUM TRAFFIC
 When the number of Email communication data is large, 
the email communication network shown in Figure 2 
become to be very complicated. From Figure 2, we can not 
identify suspicious email accounts and small computer crime 
gangs. In order to solve this problem, we proposed a 
clustering method based on communication traffic. Using 
this method, we can cluster the email accounts and 
distinguish the different small groups. 
The basic process of clustering is as follows:  
R eturn clusterSet
 C reate a set U , storing all the vertexes of G
 U  is em pty?Yes
 Choose a vertex v in U
 N o
 C reate a set Cluster, 
storing a cluster

the Q

to vi in G ,add to set N

Using the clustering method, the email graph of figure 2 
will be changed to figure 5.

 Figure. 5. Email network graph after clustering 
As shown in Figure 5, we found 500 email edges were 
clustered into 3 clusters, including one complex cluster 
structure and two relatively simple clusters.

VIII. CLUSTERING ANALYSIS BASED ON BETWEENNESS 
CENTRALITY
 When the cluster has a number of edges, the edges will 
influence our judgments. In the case, we also need to delete 
the redundant edges, making the cluster more closely. How 
to determine which edge of the graph is the most distant 
relative? We will use the method based on Centrality 
analysis to solve this problem. Centrality analysis is one of 
the most important methods in social networks analysis. The 
centrality of a member reflects his role in the social network. 
Here we use the Betweenness centrality method.  
Betweenness centrality [2] is a measure of a vertex's 
centrality. If the value of betweenness centrality of a vertex 
is larger, the vertex can be an important communication 
vertex. It also shows that there is more communications 
traffic need to pass this vertex, so this vertex can be the 
center vertex in the small group. 
Here we design an algorithm based on betweenness 
centrality for the cluster analysis of email graph, digging out 
the important members and their relationship in small 
groups. 
The formula for calculating the betweenness centrality of 
the vertex i are as follows: 


 )(
 i """"""""""""""""""?3?
 Here, gjk(i) is the number of the shortest path between 
vertex j and vertex k through the vertex i, gjk is the number 
of the shortest path between vertex j and vertex k . 
The algorithm of calculating the weight of edge based on 
betweenness centrality as shown in figure 6.

For a suspected criminal organization, we can find more 
important role members of the email network using the 
above method. Through further investigation and forensics, 
we can identify the role of criminals.  
IX. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
 This paper proposed a comprehensive forensics solution 
including email network creating method, weight calculation 
method, graph clustering algorithm based on minimum 
traffic and betweenness centrality, using which to analyze a 
suspicious email data. Our experimental results show that 
these methods have good usability to email forensics for 
organized crime. But our studies have nothing to do with the 
content of the email body, limited to email attributes. Our 
next research work will be studying effective email forensics 
method for more contents of email, especially Chinese email 
body content.
