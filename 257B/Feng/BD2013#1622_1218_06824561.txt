It is our pleasure to welcome you to the First International Conference on Advanced Cloud and Big 
Data (CBD 2013) at Southeast University (SEU), Nanjing, China. This conference is jointly organized by 
SEU and IBM Corporation. Last year both sides established the Cloud Computing Center of Excellence at 
SEU, which is the first IBM-university joint cloud research center in the world. The conference CBD 
2013 is organized to promote the cooperative cloud computing research and development between 
academia and industry. 
 
We received 103 papers submitted to the conference from the universities, research institutes as well as 
enterprises from all over the world. Each submitted paper was reviewed and judged by at least two 
program committee members according to its originality, significance, technical quality, presentation and 
relevance to the conference. Finally, 33 papers were accepted by CBD 2013. The total acceptance rate of 
the main conference was 32%. 
 
As conference organizers, we hope that CBD 2013 serves as a creative and friendly platform for 
researchers and practitioners to exchange information regarding advancements in the state of the art and 
practice in related fields. Besides the latest research achievements, it also covers innovative commercial 
data management systems, innovative commercial applications of cloud computing and big data 
technology, and experience in applying recent research advances to real-world problems. And all 
participants can obtain much rewarding experience as well as have much fun during CBD 2013. 
 
The success of CBD 2013 is ensured by the endeavor of many people and organizations. First, we
