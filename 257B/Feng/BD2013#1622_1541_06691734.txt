Abstract—Protein subcellular localization prediction based on 
machine learning is a research focus in bioinformatics. The fast 
growth of protein sequences in databases leads to be hard to label 
enough protein samples only by experts for training a learner to 
get satisfying prediction result. This paper proposes a novel 
integrated method for human multiplex protein subcellular 
localization prediction. In this method, to avoid artificially 
evaluating and labeling the big data of unseen proteins, an active 
sample selection algorithm is presented to pick out protein 
samples with non-experimental labels as supplementary training 
data to help train an ensemble predictor, which includes a 
protein identifying module, a single-label classifier and a multi-
 label classifier. The numerical experiments show the effectiveness 
of the proposed approach.  
Keywords—protein subcellular localizaiton; big data?multiplex

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Knowledge of protein subcellular location is very 
significant for deducing protein function, revealing disease 
pathogenesis, identifying drag target and so on. Comparing 
with traditional biology experiments, prediction methods based 
on intelligent computation for protein subcellular localization 
are superior for significantly saving time and cost [1]. There 
have been many computational methods to predict protein 
subcellular locations [2-9], and this kind of technique is more 
and more significant for this field. However, rapid growth of 
new protein sequences brings many new challenges. Especially, 
the discovery of multiplex proteins which can be localized at 
more than one location is a sign that the study on protein 
subcellular localization has stepped into a new stage.  
On challenge is big data. According to the record of 
UniprotKB (release 2013_08), there are 41991850 protein 
entries in this database, where the number of data with 
reviewed subcellular location comment is 322023 and the other 
41669827 protein data are unlabeled. It is impossible to label 
such huge number of proteins merely via experiments or 
manual work, therefore, computational approaches are the best 
choices. Nevertheless, computational methods always need a 
large number of reliable labeled data for training feasible 
classifiers, but the number of available labeled protein 
sequences in many tasks are not enough to learn a good 
classifier for prediction [10]. For example, the virus benchmark 
dataset in [11] only consists 207 data. This problem is mainly 
caused by two reasons, one reason is existing methods only use 
the proteins labeled by experiment, which is a small part of 
entire reviewed data; the other reason is most of collected data 
are abandoned for redundant or homologous reason. It needs 
more labeled protein samples to supply enough information for 
prediction, but if people evaluate all unseen samples in such a 
big dataset to select some data to label, it also costs too much.  
Another challenge is, when a predicting algorithm learns 
sample information, singplex proteins and multiplex proteins 
interfere with each other and it leads to be hard to get high-
 accuracy results for both two types of proteins. Conventional 
predicting methods always try to use the approaches based on 
multi-label learning to uniformly predict singplex and 
multiplex proteins. But the localizing mechanisms of the two 
types of proteins are very different, therefore, a single multi-
 label classifier is hard to get satisfying results on both of them.  
Human proteins have the most complicated localization 
mechanism, and above mentioned two challenges also exist in 
human multiplex protein subcellular localization prediction. 
Hum-mPLoc 2.0 [12] and iLoc-Hum [13] are two of the best 
predictors for human proteins, but they also suffer from the two 
problems. In this paper, a novel integrated method is proposed 
for human multiplex protein subcellular localization prediction 
to deal with two above challenges. Instead of traditional 
proteins labeled by experiments, we focus on another type of 
reviewed proteins which are labeled by non-experimental 
prove [14]. Be different from unseen data without labels,  this 
kind of proteins have non-experimental labels which have high 
confidence level but a part of them may still have some 
inaccuracy. Therefore, we first propose an active sample 
selection algorithm to evaluate and select non-experimental 
proteins in a sample pool. The selected proteins are most 
valuable and added into original small training dataset to be 
new training data. They do not need to be labeled manually and 
their non-experimental labels are deemed to be real labels to be 
directly used for training. Based on the updated training dataset, 
we then present an ensemble predictor composed of a protein 
identifying module, a single-label classifier and a multi-label 
classifier. When the predictor works, a query protein is first 
identified whether it is a multiplex protein. If the answer is yes, 
the protein will be dealt with by the multi-label classifier, 
otherwise, it is dealt with by the single-label classifier.

II. THE PROPOSED METHOD
 The proposed method includes an active sample selection 
algorithm for updating training set and an ensemble predictor 
for multiplex protein subcellular localization prediction. The 
ensemble predictor actually is a frame which is based on the 
preliminary identification for query protein and the identifying 
module is the key of this predictor,  and the types of single-
 label and multi-label classifier are not fix but adjustable 
according to practical problems. The work process of the 
integrated method is illustrated in Fig. 1. 
A. Active Sample Selection 
Let } ’1 2x , x , , x ll nD ? A represent the original training set 
consisting of ln  protein samples classified in m  different 
subcellular locations. Each protein xk lDŒ  can be represented 
by a feature vector of d  dimension as ] _T1 2, , ,k k kdx x xA , and 
the label set ] _T1 2y , , ,k k k kmy y y? A  denotes the protein 
subcellular locations of xk . For each protein xk , if it inhabits 
the thi subcellular location, label 1kiy ? , otherwise 1kiy ? / .
 The basic classifier : 2d mf ›{  is trained by lD . Let  
* +} ’x , y 1u s s uD s n| |? ~ ~  denote the supplementary training 
sample pool containing un  non-experimental proteins, where 
each protein ] _T1 2x , , ,s s s sdx x x| | | |? A has the set of subcellular 
locations ] _T1 2y , , ,s s s smy y y| | | |? A . For each protein x s| , if its 
thj subcellular location is a experimental/non-experimental 
label, mark 1 / 1sj e sj ney y| |? ?  otherwise 1siy| ? / . Both 
1sj ey| ?  and 1sj ney| ?  mean 1sjy| ? , and the subscripts are just 
for marking the label’s origin. 
For a sample * +x , ys s| |  in uD , an evaluation function

B. Protein Identification Algorithm 
This part we present the identification algorithm based on 
transductive learning [15] to distinguish singleplex protein and 
multiplex protein. Let tD  be the testing set including tn  query 
protein samples. Denote } ’1 2x , x , , xl t nD D D? ?I A is the 
union of lD  and tD , where the first ln * +ln n2 proteins are 
labeled and the remaining proteins are unlabeled query proteins. 
For convenience, suppose } ’1, 2, , lL n? A is the index set for 
the labeled protein samples and } ’1, 2, ,l lU n n n? - - A for the 
unlabeled query samples, therefore we have } ’,L UD D D? .
 Let iQ denote the number of subcellular locations for a 
protein x i in D . The values of iQ  on LD  can be directly fixed, 
i.e. } ’ * +1, y y ,i ij ij ij i iQ y y y i L-? ? - Œ Œ5 , and the iQ values 
on UD will be estimated for identifying the query proteins, 
which is our goal. 
We build a weighted neighborhood graph * +, ,G V E C?  to 
characterize the relation between similar proteins, which 
consists of a set of vertices V on D , a subset edges E of 
V V· , and a nonnegative weight function ] _: 0,1W E › . If a 
sample x i  is among the k nearest neighbors of another 
sample x j , we will have * +, 0C i j @  and say that there is an 
edge between x i  and x j . We define an n n·  weight matrix 
C to describe the similarity degrees among the whole protein 
samples:

And then we can obtain the optimal solution iQ

protein sample x i  , and its number of the subcellular location 
is predicted as the closest integer to iQ
 , . If the value of 
iQ
 , equals to 1, the query sample x i  will be identified as a 
singleplex protein to be dealt with by a single-label classifier; 
otherwise, it will be identified as a multiplex protein to be dealt 
with by a multi-label classifier. Our method does not fix the 
types of the two classifiers, which are adjustable and will be 
determined according to practical problems. The choosing and 
combining pattern of single-label and multi-label classifiers 
will not be discussed in this paper. 
III. EXPERIMENTS
 In this section, the performance of proposed method is 
evaluated on the human proteins data by independent test. The 
human benchmark dataset established by [12] is adopted as the 
original training dataset, which includes 3106 human protein 
sequences and 14 different subcellular location classifications. 
1213 human non-experimental proteins are collected from 
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database by us to constitute the 
supplementary training sample pool. 321 new proteins labeled 
by experiments construct a testing dataset. In order to reduce 
the redundancy and avoid homology bias, none of the proteins 
in the entire three datasets has ‡ 25% sequence similarity to 
any other. Table I show the general information of each dataset.

The concerned 14 subcellular locations are as follows: centriole, cytoplasm, cytoskeleton,
 endoplasmic reticulum, endosome, extracell, golgi apparatus, lysosome, microsome,
 mitochondrion, nucleus, peroxisome, plasma membrane, and synapse
 In the numerical experiments, the amphiphilic pseudo 
amino acid composition [16] is adopted as the feature 
extraction technique to represent protein sequences. The 
protein sequences can be formulated with a valid mathematical 
expression by this method through a public online server 
named PseAAC at: http://www.csbio.sjtu.edu.cn/bioinf/PseAA/. 
In our experiments, amino acid characters are empirically 
chosen to be hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity and mass; weight 
factor is 0.4 and lambda parameter is 5. We employ the popular 
ML-RBF [17] neural network  as the multi-label classifier and 
combine it with a classic KNN single-label classifier for each 
prediction task, where the ML-RBF classifier is trained on the 
whole training set and the KNN classifier is trained by all the 
singleplex protein samples. The parameters of ML-RBF are 
assigned the same values as the original paper the value, and 
the number of nearest neighbor is 10k ? . The slack variable in 
our method is 2? ? for multiplex proteins, and all the 
parameters in the experiments are fixed.  
Learned by the same training sets, we compare our 
algorithm with Hum-mPLoc 2.0 [12] and iLoc-Hum [13], 
which are two popular web-server predictors for the subcellular 
localization prediction of human multiplex proteins. Besides, 
since the ML-RBF classifier is incorporated into our integrated 
method for the prediction task, we observe the prediction result 
of using this algorithm alone for comparison too. We also test 
the performance of our ensemble predictor without the active 
sample selection, which includes two cases?using no non-
 experimental proteins and directly using all the non-
 experimental proteins in the supplementary training sample 
pool. 3 global indices: accuracy, MCC, F1-sore, and 4 popular 
multi-label indices: average precision, ranking loss, coverage 
and one-error are employed as evaluation metrics.  
The comparison result is as shown in Table II, and the 
preferred proportion of non-experimental samples selected is 
40%c ? . It can be seen our method achieves the best results 
in all the 7 evaluation metrics. The superior performance to 
ML-RBF classifier means the proposed method can sufficiently 
utilizes the individual strengths and abilities of single-label and 
multi-label classifiers and indeed gets the improvement for an 
individual multi-label algorithm of multiplex protein 
subcellular localization prediction. Here, we just select and 
integrate two common classifiers, and the proposed ensemble 
predictor has achieved better prediction result than existing two 
best human predictors. If more suitable classifiers replace the 
two classifiers  used in the experiment, our method will 
become more powerful. Moreover, the better performance of 
our method than the same ensemble predictor with no non-
 experimental proteins indicates this kind of proteins indeed can 
help to retrain and improve basic classifier, and the better 
prediction result than the ensemble predictor directly using all 
non-experimental proteins means not all the non-experimental 
proteins are proper to update classifier and we should use this 
kind of proteins selectively. Therefore, the active sample 
selection is indeed useful and necessary for human multiplex 
proteins subcellular localization prediction.
