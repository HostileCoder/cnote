 ABSTRACT
 This paper provides analysis of over and under voltage 
events captured by smart meters. Using data analysis 
techniques, the relationship of voltage events is analyzed 
with respect to ambient temperature, times of the day, 
days of the week, duration, magnitude and embedded 
generation status. Clusters of voltage violation sites are 
grouped to upstream supply distribution substations and 
zone substations. The analysis forms the basis of 
proactive voltage improvement that can be undertaken by 
the supply utility.
 INTRODUCTION
 Jemena Electricity Networks (JEN), an electricity 
distribution company in the state of Victoria, Australia, is 
currently undertaking a government mandated program to 
roll out smart meters to 310,000 residential and small 
commercial consumers. 50% of the smart meters have 
been installed by December 2012, with the full rollout 
scheduled to complete by the end of 2014.
 These smart meters capture 30-minute energy usage data 
(import and export) and report to centralized computer 
systems via a two-way communication infrastructure. 
The smart meters also monitor steady state voltages. With 
the installation of smart meters, voltage sensing is 
progressively available at Low Voltage (LV) supply 
points of the electricity distribution network. While the 
availability of supply voltage data is a welcoming 
development, JEN is now obligated to investigate and 
correct non-compliance as revealed by the smart meters.
 DESIGN OF THE ELECTRICITY 
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM
 Fig. 1 is a simplified representation of the electricity 
supply system in the state of Victoria, Australia. The 
power stations are connected by the transmission network 
to the terminal stations. At the terminal stations the 
transmission voltages are stepped down into sub-
 transmission voltages. The distribution companies take 
supply from the terminal stations and distribute to end 
customers through further voltage transformation at zone 
and distribution substations. It is noteworthy that the 
distribution companies generally run a 4-wire low voltage 
distribution network from each distribution substation, 
which can supply up to 150 customers.
 On-load tap changers and automatic voltage regulation 
are applied at the power stations, terminal stations and 
zone substations, and Medium Voltage (MV) in-line 
voltage regulators for long rural lines. In suburban 
distribution network, voltage regulation at the zone 
substations would be designed to allow for voltage drop 
on the MV distribution line, the distribution transformer 
and the LV feeder runs, to ensure that the last customer at 
the end of the LV feeder will be supplied with sufficient 
voltage during peak load period.  There is therefore a 
tendency to design for a supply voltage at the high end of 
the prescribed range.
 CONSEQUENCES OF VOLTAGE NON 
COMPLIANCE
 Public electricity supply networks are required to deliver
 voltages within narrow ranges. This ensures that the 
supply voltages are compatible with the design 
parameters of consumer electrical equipment. Supply 
voltage non-compliance has high societal costs as it 
impacts on the efficiency, performance and life 
expectancy of electrical equipment.
 Except for large commercial or industrial customers, 
however, direct monitoring of the quality of voltage 
delivered is not possible due to the relatively high cost of 
providing measurement at each customer’s point of 
supply. Electricity distribution utilities generally adopt a 
reactive approach of responding to customer voltage 
complaints. This approach could be appropriate if it is 
expected that supply voltages are within declared range 
for most customers and most of the time. This is because 
customers generally only complain of high or low voltage

when they can observe something abnormal. Hidden 
costs such as lower equipment efficiency and shortened 
equipment life are not obvious to most customers. 
The recent growth in embedded generation (EG) into 
electricity distribution networks, facilitated by 
government greenhouse gas reduction policy, has 
highlighted the undesirability of high supply voltages. 
For EG to generate power back into the supply network, 
the voltage at the point of common coupling (PCC) 
would need to be raised above the utility supply voltage. 
There could be local voltage rise along the supply circuit 
instead of voltage drop [1], [2], [3]. Unless these 
challenges are overcome, curtailment of EG would have 
to be in place or expensive network augmentation would 
be required to accommodate the increasing penetration of 
EG.
 FORM OF VOLTAGE QUALITY DATA
 The AMI communication technology utilised by JEN is a 
mesh radio network between the AMI meters and the 
meter Access Points. To conserve the limited bandwidth 
of the mesh radio system, a "report by exception" 
methodology has been adopted for voltage quality events.
 Under and over voltage events are generated locally in 
the smart meter whenever the set thresholds are exceeded. 
The events are then transmitted to the central Network 
Management System.
 The undervoltage and overvoltage thresholds are set as 
follow:
 ‚ Undervoltage set point is 216V (230V - 6%)
 ‚ Overvoltage set point is 253V (230V + 10%)
 ‚ Events are only generated when the set point is 
exceeded for a time period of 180 seconds or 
more
 The events consist of information such as meter 
identification, event date, start time (for start events), end 
time (for stop events), average voltage, maximum 
(minimum) voltage, supply address etc.
 Cognos has been chosen as the Business Intelligence tool 
for data analysis. For the purpose of exploratory data 
analysis, the events can also be downloaded from the 
Network Management System as Comma-Separated 
Values (CSV) files for analysis by software packages 
such as Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Access or MatLab.
 VOLTAGE QUALITY DATA - THE BIG DATA 
Gartner, leading information technology research and 
advisory company, defines "big data" as having 
characteristics that can be denoted by three "Vs": Volume,
 Velocity and Variety. Voltage quality data is a form of 
"big data" as it possesses the following characteristics:
 Volume
 A snapshot of over and undervoltage events reported by 
100,000 smart meters, over a 6-day period in summer 
2012, is shown in Fig. 2 below:
 It can be seen from Fig. 2 that overvoltage condition is a 
regular occurrence affecting approximately 6,000 
customer sites (6%). Undervoltage condition is equally 
significant affecting approximately 5,000 customer sites 
(5%) but only on high ambient temperature days, 
triggered by the use of space cooling equipment. On the 
other hand, based on customer voltage complaints, 
confirmed under and over voltage cases total about 120 in 
calendar year 2011.
 The voltage quality data that JEN has to process from 
smart meters are voluminous in comparison to customer 
voltage complaints. 
Velocity
 Velocity refers to the speed of data generation and 
disappearance. 
A total of 6,131 customer sites have experienced
 undervoltage in the 6-day period. However, not all 6,131 
sites experienced undervoltage throughout the six days.
 In other words undervoltage conditions are transient in 
nature and do not form an easily recognisable pattern.

The velocity of undervoltage site generation and 
disappearance is illustrated by the plot below, which 
shows the number of "active" undervoltage sites versus 
time in the 6-day period:
 Similarly, 12,251 customer sites experienced overvoltage 
in the 6-day period but few sites gave rise to overvoltage 
event throughout the period, as shown in Table 2 below:

 Variety
 Variety refers to the number of disparate databases 
containing data that must be processed for enhanced 
insight and decision making. 
To allow corrective action to be taken, the smart meter 
voltage quality data must be analysed in conjunction 
with network connectivity data (stored in spatial 
database such as Geographical Information System 
GIS), network asset data (in GIS and/or SAP) and real-
 time voltage data (in Supervisory Control And Data 
Acquisition system SCADA).
 EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS
 It can be seen from the discussion above that it is a 
challenging task to turn the "big data" into actionable 
information that JEN can use to proactively rectify the 
voltage non-compliance revealed by smart meters.
 While efficient data analytic tools are required to handle 
the big data, exploratory data analysis conducted on 
sample data sets is valuable as it allows insight to be 
gained on the specification for the ultimate data analytic 
tools, the ancillary data requirement as well as the types 
of query to be run on the data sets.
 The exploratory data analysis presented in this paper is 
conducted using Microsoft Excel. The sample data sets
 consist of voltage events collected from 100,000 active 
smart meters over the 6-day period from 23 to 28 Feb 
2012. Other database extracts include network topology 
snapshots from GIS, residential photovoltaic (PV) 
installation data from GIS, meter reference data from 
SAP, and ambient temperature information from the 
Bureau of Meteorology.
 The exploratory data analysis reveals the following useful 
insight:
 ‚ Strong correlation of undervoltage events with 
ambient temperature - undervoltage events 
virtually non-existent at ambient temperature 
below mid 20's, and rising rapidly when ambient 
temperature reaches the mid 30's. Overvoltage 
events, on the other hand, do not show strong 
correlation with ambient temperature;
 ‚ Majority of overvoltage events are caused by the 
existing voltage regulation being set "a tab" too 
high. Care needs to be exercised, however, to 
ensure that dropping the voltage regulation 
setting will not lead to worsening of the 
undervoltage situation on hot days;
 ‚ The appropriateness of conventional Load Drop 
Compensation voltage regulation schemes may 
need to be reviewed;
 ‚ Definitive pattern of start times can be observed 
for undervoltage events. Coupled with the

insight gained from ambient temperature 
relationship, adaptive voltage control schemes 
based on ambient temperature and time of day 
could be feasible to improve on the undervoltage 
situation;
 ‚ Residential photovoltaic installations, modest in 
its current penetration (about 4%), is already 
observed to have a discernible impact on 
overvoltage occurrence. The effect will become 
more significant as the penetration of PV 
increases further;
 ‚ Priority for voltage non compliance 
investigation and rectification can be set based 
on the level of voltage deviation and time 
duration as revealed by the smart meter voltage 
events;
 ‚ Clusters of voltage events around particular 
distribution substations may indicate 
inappropriate  off-load transformer tap setting;
 ‚ Clusters of distribution substations around 
particular zone substations may indicate 
inappropriate on-load tap change setting;
 ‚ Customers who experience both overvoltage and 
undervoltage events may indicate an upstream 
asset overload condition;
 Details of the analysis results can be found in [4], [5].
 FUTURE WORK
 Due to the limitation posed by Microsoft Excel in the size 
of CSV files that it can handle and the computational 
speed, only 6-day of voltage events can be analysed at 
one time.
 JEN intends to leverage on the insight gained through the 
exploratory data analysis and implement in its Business 
Intelligence tool – Cognos provided by IBM. JEN is also 
considering other grid analytics tools such as Teradata 
and Greenplum for applications that demand much faster 
response times. 
For the Victoria University research project, the next 
phase focuses on modelling residential PV generation and 
its effect on voltage delivery in electricity distribution 
network. The ultimate aim of the research project is to 
develop innovative voltage control scheme that 
maximises the amount of PV that can be accommodated.
