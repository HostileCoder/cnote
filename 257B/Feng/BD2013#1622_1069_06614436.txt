On behalf of the IEEE Photonics Society, I want like to welcome you to the 2013 Summer Topical Meetings
 held on the beautiful Big Island of Hawaii. With more than 20 years of tradition, the IEEE Summer Topicals
 are the premier conferences for emerging fields in photonic science, device technologies, and applications.
 The conferences are held to create the opportunity to learn about exciting new topics and to interact with
 the research and technology leaders in an intimate environment. This year the Topical Meetings are:
 Micro- and Nano-Cavity Integrated Photonics
 Space-Division Multiplexing for Optical Communication
 Quantum Photonics & Communications
 Non-Reciprocal Photonic Devices
 Data Center Photonics
 Joint technical sessions, conference panels, and the conference reception will no doubt provide an
 opportunity for exchange of ideas. A unique aspect of this conference series is that the Photonic Society
 membership propose and organize these meetings. Hence these "bottom-up" conferences seek to address
 exciting new research that is of interest to our members to sustain and grow new topical areas for
 translation of science into photonic technology. I would like to thank each of the Topical Chairs and the
 Program Committee Members who have volunteered and invested their time organizing these conferences.
 I also want to thank the plenary and invited speakers for giving us their perspectives on the exciting new
 developments and the challenges in these five fields. Finally I would like to express my sincere
 appreciation to the Photonic Society Conference Staff for their professional organization and arrangements.
 The conference is held at the Hilton Waikoloa Village, located only 20 miles from the Kona International
 Airport. For family or friends accompanying conference participants, there are stimulating activities
 available, including visiting active volcanoes, incredible snorkeling, tasty Luau, exploring native ruins, or
 simply enjoying the sand and sun. So I hope you will be stimulated by new device concepts, learn about
 emerging communication systems, and network with your colleagues. Try also to find a little time to enjoy
 Hawaii and work on your tan!
