Abstract— Big Data analytics can revolutionize the healthcare 
industry. It can improve operational efficiencies, help predict 
and plan responses to disease epidemics, improve the quality of 
monitoring of clinical trials, and optimize healthcare spending 
at all levels from patients to hospital systems to governments. 
This paper provides an overview of Big Data, applicability of it 
in healthcare, some of the work in progress and a future 
outlook on how Big Data analytics can improve overall quality 
in healthcare systems. 
Keywords- Big Data, Healthcare 
I. INTRODUCTION TO BIGDATA 
Big Data refers to large, complex datasets that are 
beyond the capabilities of traditional data management 
systems to store, manage, and process in a timely and 
economical manner. Often in petabytes, structured, semi-
 structured, and unstructured, Big Data creates challenges in 
data capture, transfer, encryption, storage, analysis, and 
visualization [1].  Big Data is a disruptive phenomenon, still 
in the early stages of adoption for many sectors, but it is very 
clear that harnessing its capabilities can provide compelling 
benefits. 
Web 2.0 companies were most successful in monetizing 
Big Data. Many Big Data related innovations were also 
developed by them, contributing to the industry a growing 
collection of open source technologies that have dramatically 
changed the culture of collaborative software development 
and the scale and economics of hardware infrastructure [2].  
Industry analyst reports show that Big Data and analytics 
can generate significant financial values in many vertical 
markets, including healthcare, finance, retail, environmental 
research, genomics, and biological and life science research. 
Big Data market is estimated to grow 45% annually and 
expected to be over $25 billion by 2014 [3][4]. See Figure 1. 
Considering the fact that healthcare spending is one of 
the biggest financial challenges of the U.S., optimizing it 
while improving the quality of care is extremely important 
for patients to health care providers to government agencies. 
Long term fiscal challenges for federal and state 
governments include the growing costs of Medicare, 
Medicaid, and other public health programs, which are often 
hampered by lack of access and timeliness of the data that 
reside across various computer systems silos [5]. According 
the Harvard School of Public Health publication entitled The 
Promise of Big Data, petabytes of raw information could 
provide clues for everything from preventing tuberculosis to 
shrinking health care costs—if we can figure out how to 
apply this data [6]. Improving the care of chronic diseases, 
uncovering the clinical effectiveness of treatments, and 
reducing readmissions are expected to be top priority use 
cases for Big Data in healthcare [7].

II. HEALTHCARE INDUSTRY OVERVIEW 
The healthcare industry is one of the most critical 
industries. It is also one of the world's largest and fastest-
 growing industries [7][8].  
The U.S. healthcare industry is evolving through 
significant challenges in recent times. Some of the key 
challenges include, but are not limited to: escalating costs of 
care delivery, raising patient volumes with the passage of the 
Affordable Care Act, an aging population with a high 
incidence of chronic disease, substantial shortage of medical 
professionals, and penalties for readmissions and significant 
reductions in reimbursement. 
In most countries, healthcare costs account for a good 
percentage of its economy. For example, the cost of 
healthcare spending in 2012 in the U.S. was estimated at 
$2.6 trillion, approximately 17.6% of gross domestic product 
(GDP) [9]. See Figure 2.  In the future, the cost of healthcare 
is projected to continuously increase. For example, estimates 
2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data
 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 17
put U.S. healthcare costs at $4.1 trillion in 2016. Individual 
segments within healthcare industry also follow the same 
trend. A report by IMS Research estimates that spending for 
pharmacy drugs will increase to $1.2 trillion by 2016 [9].  
 
Figure 2. Healthcare spending by geography  
 
While the healthcare industry is very critical and vast, it 
is unfortunately highly inefficient. According to a report 
from the Institute of Medicine, one third of the spending in 
healthcare (approximately $750 billion) today is wasted and 
not contributing to improving healthcare outcomes. A further 
breakdown analysis of the waste in healthcare in the same 
report from the Institute of Medicine indicates many areas 
such unnecessary services, administrative waste including 
unproductive and duplicate documentation, inefficiently 
delivered services, high prices, fraud and missed prevention 
opportunities [10]. 
 
Figure 3. Waste in Healthcare spent 
 
To understand the sources of inefficiencies in healthcare, 
it is extremely important to understand how data, processes, 
people, and devices enable care coordination. Lack of 
coordination and standards result in higher cost and poor 
outcome. It is estimated that in one out of five elderly 
patients are readmitted within 30 days of discharge for no 
known reason. See Figure 4. 
 
Figure 4. Example of inefficiencies in healthcare  
Insurance companies and governments reimburse for 
procedures performed rather than outcomes achieved. 
Patients bear little responsibility for the cost of the health 
care services they demand 
Reforming healthcare to improve the quality and care is 
essential to address efficiencies in the system, increasing 
costs, poor quality, and increasing numbers of people 
without health insurance coverage. Major healthcare reforms 
are being debated in the U.S. and around the world. The 
focuses of healthcare reforms include: 
• Improving quality, safety, efficiency, and reducing 
health disparities 
• Engaging patients and family 
• Improving care coordination and public health 
• Maintaining the privacy and security of patient 
health information 
• Enhancing clinical outcomes 
• Improving population health outcomes 
• Increasing transparency and efficiency 
• Empowering individuals 
• Generating more robust research data on health 
systems 
As the healthcare industry focuses on improvements, Big 
Data Analytics can play a significant role in addressing the 
challenges of mining the relevant information at the point of 
care to enable safer, faster, more cost effective, and more 
efficient medical practices. 
III. BIGDATA IN HEALTHCARE 
The Big Data revolution has begun for many industries. 
The healthcare industry has been playing catch up and has 
finally reached a consensus on the value of Big Data as a 
transformative tool. According to McKinsey & Company 
study entitled The Big Data Revolution in Healthcare, big-
 data revolution is under way in health care enable by 
increased availability of information. Major data sources 
include years of research and development data form 
pharmaceutical companies, Electronic Medical Records 
(EMRs) and Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from 
healthcare providers, and clinical trials data covered under 
public insurance programs from US government agencies. 
Recent technology advancements in hardware and software 
are making it easier to collect, transfer, storage, aggregate, 
and analysis data from multiple sources [24]. Yet there are 
privacy and standardization challenges that need to be 
addressed before we full adaption.  
Overall, McKinsey & Company estimates that $300 
billion to $450 billion can be saved in the healthcare industry 
from Big Data Analytics [12].  
18
While healthcare industry is slowly realizing the value 
from Big Data, Kaiser Permanente, Blue Shield of California 
and AstraZeneca are few exceptions who have already 
implemented integrated analytics systems to improve 
efficiency [24].  
Kaiser Permanente’s HealthConnect system connecting 
all their facilities have improved outcomes in cardiovascular 
disease and achieved an estimated $1 billion in savings from 
reduced office visits and lab tests. Blue Shield of California, 
in partnership with NantHealth, has developed an integrated 
technology system to improve health-care delivery. 
AstraZeneca in partnership with HealthCore, a subsidiary of 
WellPoint, is conducting real-world studies to determine the 
most effective and economical treatments for some chronic 
illnesses and common diseases [24]. 
Some argue that the key to making Big Data a greater 
reality in healthcare is by integrating healthcare provider 
systems with insurance agencies and government agencies. If 
consensus cab be reached on privacy, legal, security and 
compliance issues  the combination of the three agencies can 
optimize resources and analyze their shared information to 
spot trends, speed up recoveries, and perform both evidence 
based medicine and preventive medicine [12].  
 As new care models such as Accountable Care 
Organizations (ACO) emerge, the focus is on driving the 
wellness of and identifying the at risk population well in 
advance.  Offering appropriate programs such as patient 
engagement and adherence is critical to the success of 
ACOs. Big Data patterns, trends, demographics, and claims 
can be used to predict future patterns. In a recent Healthcare 
Business News article entitled Why one Medicare Pioneer 
ACO Succeeded in Saving Money, the use of analytics 
powered by Big Data was clearly called out as a key 
initiative contributing to success. They are able to identify 
the risk for hospitalization using sophisticated algorithm 
[13].  
Big Data analytics enables the capture of insights from 
data gathered from research, clinical care settings, and 
operational settings to build evidence for improved care 
delivery. Today, as indicated in the Institute of Medicine 
(IOM) report, these are critical gaps. There is a significant 
opportunity to improve the efficiencies in the healthcare 
industry by using an evidence-based learning model, which 
can in turn be powered by Big Data analytics [9].  As the 
focus shifts from cure to preventive health and as new 
technologies such as wearable sensors evolve as part of the 
Internet of Things (IoT), the volume of data in healthcare is 
expected to grow significantly and can provide a wealth of 
actionable information. The combined power of information 
from real-time devices, people, clinical systems, and 
historical population data makes Big Data a very helpful tool 
in improving the healthcare system. 
 
IV. EXAMPLES: BIG DATA INITIATIVES IN HEALTHCARE 
 
There are several initiatives utilizing the potential of Big 
Data in healthcare. Some of the examples are listed below: 
Asthmapolis: The company has created a global 
positioning system (GPS) enabled tracker that monitors 
inhaler usage by patients, eventually leading to more 
effective treatment of asthma. By placing a small cap like 
device containing a GPS sensor on top of an inhaler, the 
company is able to gather usage information. When a patient 
is suffering from an asthma attack and is required to use his 
or her inhaler, the little device records the time and place that 
the inhaler was used and transmits this information to a web 
site. This data is then combined with information available 
through the Center for Disease Control (CDC). The CDC’S 
information includes facts such as what are the most 
prominent asthma catalysts present in the air for that location 
and where the highest pollen count is located. The end 
product is the ability to show asthmatics how other people 
with similar reactions to specific allergens reacted and if 
taking an inhaler was necessary. A patient can become more 
aware when making decisions to travel and be more aware if 
they should prepare for a potential asthma attack. The 
combination of this large amount of data can also allow a 
physician to create a personalized plan for the patient, 
targeting specific times of the day when the risk of an asthma 
attack is higher and responding by either increasing or 
decreasing the dosage [14].   
Battling the Flu: Big Data analytics has become a 
weapon for CDC to combat influenza, which claims millions 
of lives a year. Every week, the CDC receives over 700,000 
flu reports. These reports include the details on the sickness, 
what treatment was given, and whether not the treatment was 
successful. The CDC has made this information available to 
the general public called FluView, an application that 
organizes and sifts through this extremely large amount of 
data to create a clearer picture for doctors of how the disease 
is spreading across the nation in near real-time.  Along with 
providing the precise locations of patients combating the flu, 
the application provides caregivers with information such as 
what vaccines combat which strain of the flu and which 
antiviral medications can aid the patient in their recovery 
[25]. 
The applications of Big Data for combating the flu don’t 
stop at what a doctor can do for a patient; there is increasing 
development of applications that are meant to assist patients 
in their own recovery from the flu. An application called 
FluNearYou created by the Skoll Global Threats Fund and 
the American Public Health Association, asks users to input 
their symptoms in the application before they actually fall ill 
with the sickness. Thus, by gathering data when people start 
falling sick, a map of flu activity is generated and could 
allow users to prepare themselves and prevent exposure to 
the bug. Another tool, Germ Tracker, is similar to 
FluNearYou but instead pulls data exclusively from social 
media. The benefit of this is that analysts have access to the 
data from thousands of cases that have gone unreported to 
doctors. A disadvantage is that in some cases a person 
posting on social media may be incorrect about their self-
 diagnosis. Another application is Help, I Have the Flu, 
designed by the pharmaceutical company Help Remedies. 
This application also takes advantage of social media and 
searches for the person responsible for passing the flu to 
19
individuals by scanning through updates for key words such 
as “flu” and “cough” [15]. 
GNS Healthcare and Aetna: GNS Healthcare, a Big Data 
analytics company, has come together with the health 
insurance company Aetna to help combat people at risk or 
already with metabolic syndromes. GNS has developed a 
technology known as Reverse Engineering and Forward 
Simulation (REFS) that will be put to work on the data of 
Aetna insurance subscribers. Essentially, the technology will 
search for the presence of five warning signs: large waist 
size, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, low High-
 density Lipoprotein (HDL), and high blood sugar. A 
combination of any three of these lead to the conclusion that 
the patient is suffering from the condition. Two or less 
suggest that the patient may be at high risk of suffering from 
the condition. Different combinations of these warning signs 
lead to different conclusions. For example, low HDL and 
high triglycerides is a sign of high-risk hypertension within 
the next 12 months while high blood sugar and high 
triglycerides could lead to a completely different conclusion 
[16].  
Diabetes and Big Data: Diabetes patients can also 
benefit from the Big Data revolution in health care. A 
company named Common Sensing has produced GoCap, a 
cap for prefilled insulin pens that can not only record the 
amount of insulin administered daily but also the specific 
times the dosages were administered. This information is 
then transmitted to either a mobile phone where an 
application records this data or to a connected glucometer. 
This data is then easily available to healthcare professionals 
and allows them to identify problems before they become 
severe and to tweak dosages if required [17]. 
Another technology available at the intersection of Big 
Data and diabetes is a service offered by Allazo Health. 
Their system, AllazoEngin, is designed to improve on 
medication adherence programs by using predictive 
analytics. For example, predict what interventions are mostly 
likely to work for that patient based on what interventions 
already worked for other patients with similar demographics, 
behavioral profiles, and medical history [10]. 
23andMe:A privately held personal genomics and 
biotechnology company, provides rapid genetic testing. The 
company is named for the 23 pairs of chromosomes in a 
normal human cell. Their personal genome test kit was 
named "Invention of the Year" by Time magazine in 2008 
[16]. Mining DNA data from thousands of others and 
comparing it with their own genomic data will help 
understand genetic health risks and inherited conditions. 
USC Medical Monitor: Computer scientists at the 
University of Southern California (USC) are teaming up with 
neurologists, kinesiologists and public health experts to fight 
against Parkinson’s disease. The team uses various devices 
to track the movement of the patient and gather large 
amounts of data including data from 3D sensors of Microsoft 
Kinect, patient’s smartphone, and additional body sensors. 
Then the data is fed into an algorithm that analyzes the data 
to identify any significant changes in movement. Cesar 
Blanco, the head of the project, stated, “Our system will 
allow patients and their caregivers to monitor disease 
progression and the effectiveness of treatments in real-time.” 
For example, if the system identifies a decreased range of 
motion or a decreased flexibility, an alert is sent to both 
patient and caregiver. From there, the application will advise  
the patient what exercises to do that will strengthen their 
body and the caregiver can prescribe different medications or 
change the dosage of a medication. The team hopes to extend 
this technology beyond Parkinson’s Disease in the future 
[19].  
MD Anderson’s Moon Shots Program to Fight Cancer: 
Just as President John F. Kennedy in 1962 presented the 
challenge of putting a man on the moon before the end of 
1960s, MD Anderson president Ronald DePinho, M.D., has 
challenged scientists and clinicians to rapidly and 
significantly reduce mortality in several major cancers [20]. 
The Moon Shots Program aims to improve survival for 
several types of cancers. It is initially targeting eight cancers, 
selected based on rigorous criteria: the current state of 
scientific knowledge across the continuum from cancer 
prevention to survivorship; the strength and breadth of the 
assembled teams; and the potential for measurable success in 
reducing deaths. The selected cancers are: Triple-negative 
breast and ovarian, (which are linked at the molecular level, 
Leukemia (AML/MDS), Leukemia (CLL), lung, melanoma, 
and prostate. 
The Moon Shots Program is enabled by several cross 
platform collaboration efforts between various industries and 
cancer researchers. Big Data and Massive Data Analytics are 
a major part of this program. A Big Data platform enables 
centralization, integration, and secure access of patient and 
research data and analytical results. A Massive Data 
Analytics infrastructure enables complex analytics and 
clinical decision support systems using integrated patient 
information, including clinical and research data. In addition, 
an Adaptive Learning in Genomic Medicine framework for 
bringing clinical medicine and genomic research together 
enables rapid learning to improve patient management using 
Clinical Genomics, Omics-Bioinformatics, and Massive Data 
Analytics platforms within the Big Data environment [20]. 
White House Big Data Research and Development 
Initiative: Announced by the Obama Administration in 2012, 
this initiative aims to make the most of the fast-growing 
volume of digital data by investing in advanced technologies 
needed to collect, store, preserve, manage, analyze, and share 
huge quantities of data and harness these technologies to 
accelerate the pace of discovery in science and engineering, 
national security, and to transform teaching and learning. 
This initiative include a joint solicitation supported by the 
National Science Foundation (NSF) and the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) to advance the core scientific and 
technological means of managing, analyzing, visualizing, 
and extracting useful information from large and diverse data 
sets particularly in  imaging, molecular, cellular, 
electrophysiological, chemical, behavioral, epidemiological, 
clinical, and other data related to health and disease. 
In addition, the NIH Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) 
Initiative is designed to help biomedical scientists fully 
utilize Big Data being generated by research communities. 
BD2K Centers of Excellence will address these issues by 
20
developing new approaches, methods, software, tools, and 
related resources and by providing training to advance Big 
Data science in the context of biomedical research. BD2K 
Centers are expected to be large-scale efforts that take on 
challenges that are not feasible to address with the standard 
NIH Research Project Grant (R01) program. The Centers 
will form a BD2K Center Consortium in which each is 
required to interact and collaborate with other centers in the 
consortium. They are also encouraged to interact and 
collaborate with other domestic or international efforts in Big 
Data science. The BD2K Centers will work in areas 
spanning Big Data science, producing tools and resources 
from early-stage to mature development for the biomedical 
research community. The NIH would like the overall BD2K 
Center program to covers four areas: Collaborative 
environments and technologies, data integration, analysis and 
modeling methodologies and computer science and statistical 
approaches [21].  
V. INFRASTRUCTURE FOR BIG DATA IN HEALTHCARE: 
CISCO SOLUTION 
As a worldwide leader in networking, Cisco is well 
positioned to help improve the future of healthcare through 
networked technologies that transform how people connect, 
access and share information, and collaborate. Cisco 
technologies can benefit all stakeholders, from patients to 
medical providers, payers, and life sciences organizations. 
Cisco Connected Health solutions enable care team 
collaboration and business efficiency while promoting a 
higher quality of care. 
Cisco helps simplify healthcare communications using a 
network of interoperable technologies that better connect 
patients with medical providers, payers, and life science 
organizations. Cisco solutions link critical information, 
people, and knowledge to help improve the healthcare 
experience. Our vision is a Connected Health ecosystem that 
helps to shape a world of health without boundaries.  
The Cisco Architecture for Connected Health was 
developed specifically for healthcare providers to help them 
build a robust, highly secure, and scalable infrastructure for 
the delivery of healthcare service by utilizing the guidelines 
and best practices from Cisco's health care experience which 
is focused on the hospital data center, unified workspace, and 
interoperability for healthcare. See Figure 5.  
 
 
 
Figure 6. Cisco’s Architecture for Connected Health 
 
Cisco also builds an innovative family of unified 
computing products. This enables the company to provide a 
complete infrastructure solution including compute, storage, 
connectivity and unified management for Big Data 
applications that reduce complexity, improves agility, and 
radically improves cost of ownership. Cisco’s Big Data 
solution can meet standards like the Payment Card Industry 
(PCI), Data Security Standard (DSS), and Health Insurance 
Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) important for 
the healthcare industry. 
Core to Cisco’s Big Data architecture is the Cisco 
Unified Computing System™ (Cisco UCS®) Common 
Platform Architecture (CPA) for Big Data [22], a complete 
infrastructure solution including compute, storage, 
networking, and unified management designed to meet a 
broad range of applications demands.  
With recently announced support for Intel Distribution 
for Apache Hadoop [23] the architecture enables advanced 
access control, and encryption of data-in-transit and data-at-
 rest, critical for Big Data deployments in healthcare. 
 
VI. FUTURE OUTLOOK 
 
Today the healthcare industry is just beginning to 
understand all the innovative things that can be done with 
Big Data. The intersection of data from multiple sources, 
tools, and technologies will promote informative 
extrapolations of Big Data, allowing the information to 
generate new and innovative solutions to healthcare. 
The healthcare system today is on a trajectory that is 
unsustainable. The bulk of costs in the current system are 
due to patients having chronic care diseases. Thus a focus in 
the future should be on preventive care as well as population 
health management and overall wellness. With Big Data, 
health management of a population can be understood better. 
Personalized medicine is a being promoted as the future 
of the healthcare industry. Today, medicines are made for the 
masses not for the individual. Going forward, with the help 
of Big Data, more personalized medicines that uses patient-
 specific data such as genomics and proteomics can be 
created based on the profiling of similar patients and their 
responses to such approaches.  
With the increased adoption of social media and mobility 
patients today are becoming more and more knowledgeable 
about the options available to them. This is made possible by 
tools and technologies that allow them to access the data and 
reports but in the backend powered by Big Data platforms 
that intern do massive searches, aggregations, and pattern 
recognitions. New data sources and analytics technologies 
are expected to emerge in the near future that will change the 
way we practice medicine.  
Greater collaboration across industries and between the 
public and private sectors can improve efficiencies in 
healthcare system. By integrating data from various sources 
can build predictive models that can lower overall cost and 
improve quality of care significantly, and accelerate the shift 
to evidence-based and preventive-based medicine. With 
21
better analytics, the risks will at least be known and the 
decisions can more informed and quicker to make.
