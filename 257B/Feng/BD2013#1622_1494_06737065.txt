Abstract—A method for compressing the time-bandwidth of 
analog signals is introduced and demonstrated. As one of its 
applications, this mathematical transformation performs feature-
 selective time-stretch. When used as an analog pre-processor 
before the digitizer, it enables capture of random signals that 
would otherwise be beyond digitizer’s bandwidth. At the same 
time, it compresses the digital data volume. Our method is loss-
 less and does not require prior knowledge of the signal. It is 
inspired by operation of Fovea centralis in human eye and by 
anamorphic transformation in visual arts. Implemented in the 
digital domain, the proposed transform also performs data and 
image compression.

I. INTRODUCTION 
In conventional sampling, the analog signal is sampled at 
twice the highest frequency of the signal, the so-called Nyquist 
rate. This make inefficient use of the available samples because 
frequency components below the Nyquist rate are over sampled 
whereas frequency components above it are under sampled (see 
Fig. 1(a)). The problem arises because both sharp and coarse 
temporal features are sampled at the same rate. This causes two 
predicaments, (i) it limits the sharpest features that can be 
captured with a given sampling rate, and (ii) it results in a 
digital record length that is much larger than necessary (since 
coarse temporal features are over sampled).  
Using Time Stretch Transform (TST) prior to sampling 
[1-4] the first problem is solved by reducing the signal 
bandwidth. In this method the stretch factor is the same for all 
temporal features so it does not solve the second problem. 
Sharp temporal features are suitably slowed down for the 
digitizer to capture them but coarse features become over 
sampled. The over sampling of coarse temporal features results 
in the record length to be unnecessarily large.  
Here we introduce a mathematical transform to address both 
problems. Implemented in analog domain prior to digitization, 
this same-domain transform compresses the signal bandwidth 
thus allowing a fast signal to be captured by a digitizer that 
would otherwise have insufficient bandwidth. At the same 
time, it results a shorter record length. Our technique is 
compared to the conventional sampling in Fig. 1(b).  Our 
technique performs selective sampling of different time 
features in contrast to frequency selective sampling.

the Nyquist rate are over sampled whereas components above it, if 
any, are under sampled. Here ?m is the modulation frequency. (b) 
Comparison of conventional sampling (top) and proposed technique 
for feature selective sampling (bottom). The Analog to Digital 
Converter (ADC) has the same sampling rate in both cases. Through 
analog transformation of the signal prior to sampling, the proposed 
Anamorphic Stretch Transform (AST) leads to more efficient 
utilization of the ADC’s finite sampling resource. Specifically, more 
samples are allocated to sharp temporal features where they are 
needed and fewer to coarse temporal features where they are 
redundant. This compression of data is achieved without prior 
knowledge of the input waveform and in an open-loop fashion. 
While this paper focuses on applications in capturing 
ultrafast analog signals where the anamorphic transformation is 
performed in the analog domain, our mathematical 
transformation can also be performed in digital domain on 
digital data such as images. This all-digital implementation 
would be an image compression algorithm useful in dealing 
with the storage and transmission bottlenecks of “big data”.  
Analogy with Anamorphism in Graphic Arts 
The warped stretch transformation evokes comparison to 
anamorphic images used to create optical illusion and art. 
Fundamental differences exist between our technique and 
anamorphic optics. First, our technique warps the spectrum 
whereas in anamorphic optics the image is warped in its

original spatial domain. Second, the image transformation in 
anamorphic optics is arbitrary and is chosen for artistic 
considerations or to change the aspect ratio of the image. In 
contrast, in our technique the transformation causes feature-
 selective sampling without prior knowledge about the input 
waveform and in an open-loop fashion. Despite fundamental 
differences, because of the non-uniform warping of the signal 
in our technique, albeit executed in the frequency domain, we 
term our technique Anamorphic Stretch Transform (AST). 
II. TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION  
A pass-band analog signal can be represented by base-band 
waveform modulated on a carrier. Analog-to-Digital 
Converters (ADCs) digitize the modulation of input signal after 
down conversion to baseband or to a low intermediate 
frequency. Here we derive a mathematical algorithm that 
describes the optimum analog transformation that reshapes the 
spectrum of the electrical signal such that its modulation can be 
captured with an ADC that would otherwise be too slow. 
Unlike the conventional uniform time stretch pre-processing 
[1], the new transformation also minimizes the record length 
and hence the data volume.   
The transformation is implemented via a filter with 
engineered group delay (GD). Temporal group velocity 
dispersion can be represented by a filter with quadratic phase. 
We generalize the problem by allowing the phase to be an 
arbitrary function of frequency (see Fig. 2(a)). H(?) is spectral 
response of a filter with spectral phase ?(?) and group delay of 
?(?)=∂[?(?)]/∂?. To process high speed electrical signals a 
wideband dispersive filter is required. Implementation of a 
wideband dispersive filter is more practical and less costly in 
the optical domain than in the electronic domain. To employ 
optical dispersive filters the input electrical signal must be first 
converted to the optical domain using a modulator. The input 
electrical signal is modulated on an optical carrier (i.e. 
Continuous Wave (CW) light) using a modulator (see 
Fig. 2(a)). The resulting optical signal is then processed in the 
optical domain using the filter H(?) (optically dispersive 
element). If the input signal is optical to begin with, this 
modulation is not necessary.   
The modulation intensity spectrum of the input signal can 
be described in terms of the complex amplitude Ei (t): 
( ) ( ){ }2FT? =i m iI E t                        (1) 
where  FT{}  is  the  Fourier  transform  and  ?m  is the 
modulation  (radial)  frequency.  It is easy to show that the 
modulation spectrum can be also shown as a correlation 
function:

where ( )iE ?%  is the field spectrum of the input electrical 
signal. The modulation spectrum of the output optical signal 
(i.e. after the optical filter), can be calculated as follow:

Figure 2. (a) The proposed anamorphic transformation is performed 
using a filter with a tailored frequency-dependent group delay placed 
prior to the analog-to-digital converter (ADC). Specifically, the input 
electrical signal is first converted to an optical signal using a 
modulator and then is processed in the optical domain using a filter 
with arbitrary group delay profile. The complex field of the 
transformed signal is measured and the input signal is reconstructed 
using back propagation. (b) An arbitrary input signal; inset shows its 
field spectrum. (c) The Modulation Intensity Distribution (MID) of the 
signal after it is subjected to a filter with S-shaped group delay (see 
inset of (c)). The MID is a 3D plot showing dependence of the 
intensity (color) on time and modulation frequency. For comparison, 
the MID of the input signal without the filter is shown in the inset. The 
anamorphic transform reduces the signal modulation bandwidth but it 
does not lead to a proportional increase in its time duration. The 
complex interference patterns arise because the system is in the near 
field. ?m=0 corresponds to the carrier frequency. 
Here, we introduce the Anamorphic Stretch Transform 
(AST). It relates the input spectrum to output intensity 
spectrum [5]:

The exponential kernel describes the impact of the filter on 
the output intensity spectrum. For time-bandwidth 
1014
compression, the shape of the optimum group delay will be a 
sublinear function resembling the letter “S”. Therefore, one 
may refer to this particular implementation as the S-Transform 
(ST), although the Anamorphic Stretch Transform is more 
general than this particular group delay function.  
The transform, AST, gives the intensity spectrum at the 
output of the optical filter. Since our objective is to compress 
the modulation intensity bandwidth but also minimize the time 
duration, we require a mathematical tool that describes both the 
intensity spectrum and its temporal duration. The following 2D 
distribution describes the intensity spectrum and its dependence 
on time. We refer to this function as Modulation Intensity 
Distribution (MID):

The modulation spectrum and time duration of a signal 
subject to an arbitrary group delay is obtained from this 2D 
distribution. This information is then used to design the filter 
with the right group delay. MID can be described as the cross-
 correlation of the output signal spectrum with its temporally 
shifted waveform. The trajectory at t = 0 in the MID plot 
represents output intensity spectrum (see Fig. 2) and produces 
the transform AST. Also the absolute value of time shift (y-
 axis) over which cross-correlation has non-zero values is the 
time duration of the output signal (see Fig. 2). 
The MID plot for an arbitrary signal (see Fig. 2(b)) 
subjected to a filter with an S-shaped GD (see inset of (c)) is 
shown in Fig. 2(c). The 3D plot shows the dependence of the 
modulation intensity (color) at the output on time and 
modulation frequency. The inset shows the same for the input 
signal. MID relates the bandwidth and temporal length of the 
envelope to the filter phase response (group delay profile). By 
choosing the proper filter, we can engineer the intensity 
bandwidth of the signal to match the sampling rate of the ADC 
and its time duration to minimize the number of samples 
needed to represent it. As an example, the horizontal arrow 
shows the intensity bandwidth and the vertical arrow designates 
the time duration. It should be mentioned that the output signal 
has both amplitude and phase information requiring complex-
 field detection. The time domain signal can then be 
reconstructed from the measured complex field. A number of 
complex field detection techniques can be employed here [6-8]. 
While filters with arbitrary group delay profiles can be 
considered for AST operation, here we are particularly 
interested in filters with general group delay profiles that 
compress the modulation time bandwidth product (TBP). As 
suggested by the MID plot in Fig. 2, such filters should have a 
sublinear group delay profile. The tan-1 function provides a 
simple mathematical description of such filters: 
( )1( ) tan ,? ? ??= ? ?A B                               (6) 
where A and B are arbitrary real numbers. Using Eq. (6), a wide 
range of filter GD profiles can be generated requiring only two 
parameters to represent them. Parameter A in Eq. (6) is the 
amount of group delay dispersion and determines whether the 
filter is in the near field or far field regime. In the near field, A 
is on the order of the input signal duration, whereas in the far 
field, A is much larger than the duration. Parameter B is related 
to the degree of anamorphism. 
We point out that no prior knowledge of the signal is 
necessary in our technique because the transform self-adapts to 
the contents of the signal. This self-adaptivity is a consequence 
of the frequency dependency in the transformation (see 
Eq. (4)). The optical filter with nonlinear group delay can be 
implemented with dispersive elements with engineered group 
velocity dispersion such as Chirped Fiber Bragg Gratings 
(CFBG), Chromo Modal Dispersion or free space gratings (see 
[5] for more information). 
III. NUMERICAL RESULTS  
As an example on how to engineer the modulation 
bandwidth and time duration of an electrical signal using MID 
and AST, we discuss the optimum group delay profile for an 
optical filter operating in the near field regime. Operating in the 
near field regime is especially important for  the  cases  where  
far  field regime cannot be achieved because of the limited 
bandwidth of the electrical signals (compared to the optical 
carrier) and insufficient available group delay. Because loss of 
optical devices increases with group delay, in many cases high 
losses do not allow to reach the far field.  
In this example, the input electrical signal has modulation 
bandwidth of 40 GHz and ~6 ns time duration, see Fig. 3(a). 
MID of the input signal is shown in the inset of Fig. 3(a). Our 
target is to compress the input electrical signal modulation 
bandwidth to 16 GHz, i.e. a compression factor of 2.5. 
The filter transfer function is chosen such that for frequency 
components ranging from DC to 8 GHz a larger group delay is 
applied to higher frequencies than the case of linear group 
delay. The group delay for frequency components above 8 GHz 
is designed to be less than the case of linear group delay. This 
is because to achieve the same output modulation bandwidth, 
less group delay is required for fast features. 
The left inset in Fig. 3(b) compares the nonlinear group 
delay used with a linear group delay that would have resulted 
in the same 16 GHz output modulation bandwidth. As seen in 
the right inset of Fig. 3(b), the modulation bandwidth is 
16 GHz in both cases. However, the temporal duration (main 
curves in Fig. 3(b)) is ~13 ns vs. 20 ns, i.e. 35% reduction.  
Figure 3(c) compares the MID plots for the case of linear group 
delay and the nonlinear group delay used here. These MID 
plots were used to design and analyze the optimized bandwidth 
compression system in this example. The complex interference 
patterns in MID plots arise because the system is operating in 
the near field. Experimental proof of time-bandwidth 
compression using the AST has recently been reported [5]. 
AST can be also applied in the digital domain to reduce the 
data size. To demonstrate this, we compared the performance 
of image compression using AST method, with standard JPEG 
compression. Results are shown in Fig. 4. The original gray  
scale  image  had  1000?1000  pixels  and  its  data  size  was

figures show the MID of input signal for optical filter with linear and 
nonlinear group delay, respectively. In both cases the signal 
modulation bandwidth is reduced from 40 GHz to 16 GHz, however 
the temporal signal length, and hence the number of samples needed 
to represent it, is nearly 35% lower with the anamorphic transform. 
3.1 Mega Bytes (MB). The left column in Fig. 4 shows image 
compression using standard JPEG format with compression 
factor of 56. We then used AST to pre-compress the image 
before JPEG while maintaining the same total compression 
factor of 56. We also show zoomed in sections of the image for 
comparison. The results clearly show capability of the 
proposed AST for digital image compression.  
IV. CONCLUSIONS  
We introduced a new mathematical transform that can be 
used to compress the modulation time-bandwidth of signals. 
This analog processing is performed prior to digitization and is 
aimed to overcome the bandwidth limitation of data converters, 
while at the same time reducing the digital data volume. The so 
called Anamorphic Stretch Transform (AST) can be employed 
to engineer the modulation bandwidth of an arbitrary waveform 
to match the sampling rate of the ADC while minimizing the 
number of samples needed to represent it. This transformation 
causes feature-selective stretching of the waveform. Once the 
warped waveform is uniformly sampled, more samples are
