Abstract— The information revolution has radically changed 
the way we make decisions and has expanded into mobile devices 
capable of informing choices at the point at which they are made. 
However, it is arguable whether the explosion of available 
information helps or hinders decision making, including in 
important domains such as healthcare and sustainability. 
Improving on that is the domain of choice architecture, intended 
to provide decision-knowledge through understanding choice-
 implications and so guiding actions in effective and ethical 
directions (i.e. 'nudging'). Social media has largely evolved as the 
significant means of choice architecture, but the question 
remains as to whether decisions based on it are truly effective 
and ethical, or attracted toward social norms that reinforce poor 
judgment. This paper explores those issues, including how 
technologies can be shaped to improve decision-making, and how 
academic models can be used to nudge toward improved norms.

I. INTRODUCTION
 Few would argue that modern life is full of decisions, many 
of which impact our health, our quality of life and even the 
future of Planet Earth. Opting for the most ethical and rational 
decisions is difficult, and often leads to a mismatch between 
what we say we should do, and what we actually do. This 
‘value-action gap’ has led to significant interest in 'nudging' 
techniques (see e.g. [1]). Nudging, in this context, is often 
known as libertarian (or soft) paternalism: paternal in 
attempting to guide our choices, and libertarian in defending 
our freedom to make them, even defending our right to opt out 
if we wish [2]. The libertarian aspect can be seen to mediate 
paternalism: use of 'strong graphics' and manipulation of 
feelings may be paternal, but can often lead to loss of choice 
[3]. Nudging is predicated on the assumption that choices are 
often made under circumstances of limited rationality and/or 
awareness, and can be guided through the way in which the 
possible choices are presented [4]. It is not, therefore, a form of 
‘subtle manipulation’, as manipulation is seldom subtle, and 
has the potential to alienate decision makers. 
Therefore, nudging can be contrasted with regulatory routes 
to behaviour change: in healthcare it has been argued that 
nudging is not a universal solution, legislation being the 
preferential option [5]. However, it has also been said that 
regulation can cause negative attitudes toward issues it 
addresses, while conversely voluntary behaviour change can 
result in greater ownership [6]. Whether either view can be 
fully defended is a philosophical matter, but in terms of 
application of nudging to the world-wide-web it is likely that 
the multiplicity of choices, and the ethos of freedom and 
openness, is likely often to dictate an emphasis on behaviour-
 influencing over law-making. Essentially, nudging is based on 
observations that decisions can be impulsive, irrational, and 
often based on limited, even lacking, domain knowledge [2]. It 
therefore relies largely on choice-architecture in an attempt to 
signpost ethical and rational routes through important decisions 
[7]. It has been widely applied in domains such as health [8], 
agriculture [9], education [10], transport and climate change 
[11]. It is possible that it can often be considered empirical in 
application, leading to the opinion that research is needed to 
establish causality and probability links between nudge and 
achieved behaviour change [12]. So also, its efficacy can be 
based on whether behaviour change occurs in those who 
should benefit most from its application (e.g. [11]). 
For the purposes of this paper, technological-nudging can 
be defined as designing computer-systems that augment human 
decision-making through machine-knowledge and domain-
 matching, particularly through mobile-device interfaces. It is 
apparent that web-systems already contain aspects of interest, 
such as expert knowledge websites, forums and ranking 
systems (e.g. star-systems, 'like' and '+1'). However, there is 
limited evidence that these lead to improved behaviour rather 
than reinforcing established norms (a criticism which can also 
be applied to poorly-designed nudging [2]). For instance, 
despite the success of the CrowdMed website, it has been said 
that increased expert input would be beneficial [13]. It is 
therefore arguable whether web-systems nudge toward ethical 
and efficacious decisions, or simply cater for a lust to satisfy 
impulsive and irrational behaviour through 'closure'. The 
answer is important: libertarianism should dictate our right to 
'good' decisions, rather than simply decisions 'we can live 
with'. So, it is instructive to consider how technology can be 
designed around the principles of libertarian paternalism, and 
Figure 1 provides a conceptual model (around which this paper 
is organised). The human decision-making cloud system 
(Section II) represents current online systems, the opinions 
(expert and otherwise) providing the main information sources, 
with mediation through, for instance, ranking systems. 
The machine decision-making cloud system (Section III) is 
included as a fully-technological means of augmenting human 
decisions. In many ways this has partially been present since

the genesis of the web, however, much more can be done to 
facilitate use of data in decision making, especially given the 
advances in areas such as massively-parallel computing, 
artificial intelligence and the cloud. Therefore, data-mining of 
big-data, development of new knowledge bases, and dynamic 
creation of data from sensor feeds, can be considered critical 
elements. 
From an academic perspective, academic research will be 
considered a useful source of domain-knowledge in this 
system. The role of (academic) education is considered also, in 
terms of domain-specific expertise creation, validation and use 
in knowledge-to-decision mapping, within an education cloud 
(Section IV). It is hypothesised that decision-makers will be 
influenced more in their behaviour by opinions provided by 
members of crowds who have not just demonstrable and 
relevant domain-expertise, but also validated success in its 
application. This obviously draws heavily on higher education 
models, but is extended to describe a model within which 
decision-makers can help fund specific knowledge creation, 
and decision-helpers can benefit from incrementally small 
education collation: crowd-funded micro-education. 
However, despite the seeming simplicity of Figure 1, it 
should be noted that the millions of users, together with a 
multitude of servers, sensors, devices and connections, are 
likely to make it a highly complex system in full operation. 
Therefore, ‘good’ decisions could be considered emergent 
properties in a ‘sea of chaos’, potentially forming strange 
attractors around which associated norms develop. This paper 
therefore attempts to discuss the technologies that could be 
used to shape the chaotic behaviour toward the values of 
libertarian paternalism. Finally, Section V will provide a brief 
discussion on how this paper fits into the concept of 
cyberspace: an important component in integration of choice-
 architecture and nudging into daily digital-life.

II. MACHINE KNOWLEDGE
 The internet has, since its genesis, been a platform to 
enhance decision making: as well as hyper-text as a form of 
knowledge-sharing, aspects such as expert systems have 
always been evident. That has increased in the decades since 
the world-wide-web was invented, with current trends in 
massively-parallel cloud computing providing scalable, 
efficient and very high speed online computation. For example, 
Figure 2 shows the Barcelona Supercomputing Center, which 
is among the most powerful in Europe. Such facilities allow us 
to transcend, in relative terms, a simple internet, providing 
opportunities for incorporating concepts such as ‘big-data’, 
data-mining and virtualization into cloud content. Therefore, 
the significant artificial-intelligence they provide can be 
considered an important opportunity for augmenting human 
decision-making. 
As an example, humans already add to collective 
intelligence, providing, for example, crowd-sourced crime, 
weather and traffic data for knowledge-building in the cloud, 
which can also be combined with machine-knowledge from 
remote sensing. Despite the usefulness and ubiquity of the 
term, technically there is no ‘Cloud’, rather there are many 
clouds (internal to organisational networks, and externally 
hosted), providing scalability of computing resources and the 
potential (through wireless networks) for access to significant 
processing power using mobile devices [14]. The Cloud can be 
differentiated from the internet through the lack of a need to 
understand the network, or individual servers, in depth from 
the outside: storage and processing being allocated, potentially 
on an ad-hoc and fragmentary basis, when required. It is that 
scalability that is of obvious importance to nudging for two 
reasons. Firstly, processing power need not be limited by the 
number of servers, their speed, nor the number of users 
265256
connected: it is scaled to meet demand. Secondly, through 
sharing of resources within the cloud it is not necessary to have 
idle servers during low demand, reducing the environmental 
impact of computer-based nudging. 
In terms of cloud-based knowledge, we may loosely 
categorise it into ‘known’ and ‘unknown’ knowledge. Known 
knowledge can be considered data and information already 
collated, which can be incorporated into knowledge-bases 
(often just simple databases) for access and querying on 
demand, including through context-matching, expert systems, 
neural networks, artificial intelligence systems (including 
robot-connected), or simply through human reading of 
dynamic web-pages. Despite the obvious parallel to human 
knowledge, it could also include tacit knowledge, where 
codified into machine-understandable form. For instance, 
behaviour data arising from tacit knowledge, once correlated 
with other apparently unrelated environmental data, can be 
used predictively. In so doing, tacit knowledge is effectively 
codified in the statistical relationship between the two data sets. 
However, the unknown knowledge illustrates a significant 
aspect of massively-parallel computing: data-mining of big-
 data can provide important new knowledge (and continual 
refinement and update of it) that could be of significant use to 
decision makers. 
Fig. 2. Part of the Barcelona Supercomputing Center. 
An obvious example is the dynamic context of stock prices, 
but it is equally appropriate to behaviour based data (e.g. in 
clinical-care monitoring) and potentially relating previous 
choices to current decision-scenarios. Given the significant 
amounts of data generated annually in academia, it is also 
apparent that research could be designed to facilitate output of 
its data in a form more readily used by machine-knowledge 
systems. As examples, research can provide significant links 
between medical conditions and environment data [15], as well 
as links between behaviour in Dementia patients and condition-
 progression [16]. It could be argued that such research has 
value to machine-learning systems in a wider context than 
simply academic use, implying that further research is needed 
into how the significant body of academic literature can be 
made available for wider use in nudge-related decision making. 
A real-life example of knowledge building from data, and 
its use in supporting decision making, is the large virtual 
campus at the Open University of Catalonia. As well as 
academic and administrative activity it incorporates c.50,000 
students, with tutors providing lectures for 30 degrees (plus 
PhD and post-graduate programs) resulting in over 600 official 
courses. It is completely virtualized with user interaction 
generating a huge amount (c.10-15GB) of filtered and logged 
information daily. Processing and analyzing those data 
supports students and tutors, programme directors, managers 
and system developers. For instance, tutors can use it for 
monitoring and to identify dropout rates. Also, programme 
directors and managers can evaluate virtual class-performance 
and decide how to improve course/degree organization. 
Developers can then use the data to identify usage and resource 
information (e.g. server loads and response times) to optimize 
performance in the virtual campus. 
A more recent aspect of cloud systems that must also be 
considered is the Internet-of-Things or, in modern contexts, 
more correctly the Cloud-of-Things. The current interest in 
sensors and wireless-sensor networks seeks largely to create 
‘big-data’ from millions of internet-addressable (i.e. IPv6) 
devices, attached to anything from industrial machinery to 
environmental sensors (i.e. physical ’things’ whose data history 
is cloud accessible). This allows for significant enhancements 
to machine-learning systems, often through data-mining of the 
‘big-data’ they create. It also allows improvements to 
personalized service provision, with an individual’s profile (i.e. 
context) updated to reflect their prevailing state (e.g. emotions 
or medical symptoms). 
Therefore, the context-description moves from being 
simply an account of recent history, to a dynamic 
representation of prevailing state and behaviour. So, it becomes 
a more complex, richer and domain-specific representation (see 
[17] for a fuller discussion). For instance, it has been shown 
that electricity consumption, measured over short timescales, 
can provide occupant-behaviour data in homes [18], which is 
of interest in many areas including clinical home-care and 
energy-management. It can be measured, to provide data for 
nudge-design, through smart-metering, but for most contexts 
more adequate data can easily be obtained through simple, 
inexpensive, sensors (e.g. [19]), that can be incorporated 
simply into wireless systems. Similarly, smart-phones can be 
used in many ways to inform behaviour and for intervention 
(see e.g. [20] for a wide range of healthcare examples). As an 
example, Figure 3 shows prototype Android software that 
measures hand-trembling, in terms of time and frequency 
domains (both domains being influenced by age and medical 
conditions). 
Such apps have a wide range of uses. For instance, 
trembling in Parkinsons’ Disease sufferers is known to be 
related to progression of the condition, but progression can also 
be linked to behaviour changes. Also, for use in medical 
crowd-systems, it could provide additional data to further 
refine diagnosis accuracy. But, as an aspect of estimating 
‘emotional-charge’ at the decision location (which can be 
enhanced further, such as through building galvanic skin 
response measurement into devices: e.g. [21]), it is likely to 
have other uses in nudging. Also, integration of the Cloud-of-
 Things and smart-phone technologies opens up many 
interesting areas of behaviour-sensing.

For instance, Figure 4 shows RFID tags (compatible with 
NFC devices) that can be written to and read by a wide range 
of smart-phones and tablets. Also shown is an inexpensive 
RFID reader that can be used with the tags, such as built into 
furniture, ornaments, consumer-goods and even clothing for 
wearable sensor systems. The sensor modules shown in Figure 
4 include examples for inexpensive temperature, humidity, 
acceleration, rotation and red-green-blue light measurements. 
Many other inexpensive sensors are similarly available, and 
easily web-connected for mobile-device interfacing. However, 
in terms of using mobile devices for decision-support, it is 
important to recognise that potential problems such as 
(environmentally) unsustainable power-consumption due to 
graphic-intensive apps [22], and compulsive/obsessive mobile-
 device use [23], must be properly considered and mitigated 
where possible.

III. AUGMENTING HUMAN KNOWLEDGE
 As Hertwig and Erev [24] note, decisions can be especially 
difficult when we have little experience on which to base them, 
often because we underestimate the risks associated with 
decisions where there is a significant gap between experience 
and decision-description. We are also faced with difficult 
choices when time constraints limit objective analysis, or 
impulsivity overrides sensibility. In fact, the two may be 
linked, as we may feel pressured into a decision knowing that 
trying to analyse the options fully, in the available time, is 
futile. As an example, when buying goods on an auction site 
we can gain comfort and trust knowing that sellers have a 
100% positive feedback (even though feedback is given soon 
after purchase, and so does not reflect problems that may occur 
later). However, if we choose a cheaper seller with lower 
feedback, such as 99.1% over 103362 items, we can calculate 
that over 9000 buyers were less than positive about their 
purchase. It is indicative of the problem that very few people 
would actually carry out this calculation in order to choose a 
seller. 
Clicking on another link we can gain further information 
about recent feedback, and can calculate whether problems 
occurred within a time-window we consider acceptable. In 
order to fully risk assess (i.e. taking into account probability 
and severity) we must then read all of the feedback and apply 
some form of qualitative analysis, deciding whether the risks 
outweigh the advantages: generally whether the goods will be 
as described, arrive in an acceptable timeframe, and that the 
cost is worth the risk over a more expensive seller with higher 
feedback. Also, all of the above must be undertaken by the 
buyer, as auction sites do not generally allow sorting of results 
based on a perceived-risk algorithm. Under these 
circumstances, it is apparent that current web-systems do not 
fully represent decision-descriptions, and do not minimise risk 
of the ‘wrong’ decision being made. Also, even though the 
majority of ‘feedback’ is provided by buyers and sellers (i.e. 
humans) it is apparent that the model does not fully enhance 
our decision making, especially as it does not tell us whether 
the purchase is ethical, worthwhile, or necessary. Similarly, 
‘liking’ a post, video or product can be argued to reinforce 
what is popular, rather than what is truly ethical. So, moving 
norms toward more positive stances requires a means through 
which users can assess the ethicalities of their ‘likes’, including 
knowing the efficacy of the norm. For instance, environmental 
research provides much data on which products and transport 
can be judged: for example life-cycle analysis (LCA). If such 
data were included in auction listings, sorted and rated through 
inclusion of environmental footprints, it could nudge choices 
toward the more environmentally-positive. Similarly, from a 
sustainability in computing perspective, it would be interesting 
to observe the impact of rating video-clips based not just on 
popularity, but also server/device power consumption (and 
related CO2 equivalent emissions). 
However, as well as within the cloud, decision scenarios 
can be augmented using mobile devices, such as smart-phones. 
As well as providing on-the-spot access to machine and crowd 
knowledge, through mobile broadband, they also often 
incorporate a wide range of sensors. They can, for instance, be 
used for, and interfaced to, physiological (e.g. gait and ECG) 
and environment (e.g. temperature, pressure, light-level) 
monitoring (see e.g. [19]). They can also provide location-
 context data for use in decision-support systems. However, 
they can be used for much more, as demonstrated by the 
prototype Android app of Figure 5. The system allows 
interaction with everyday objects through barcodes, RFID 
(more accurately NFC, which is largely compatible with 
13.56MHz RFID tags) and voice-recognition. 
This has many uses in, for instance, healthcare, particularly 
for people coping with cognitive challenges such as in 
Dementia conditions, who can find remembering things 
267258
challenging. The prototype of Figure 5 can not only provide 
support through images, text and videos, but can also provide 
voice direction and interactive graphics. The potential for such 
systems is obviously significant in other areas where simplified 
access to information is required. However, it has four specific 
advantages that should be recognised: it can provide indoor 
location data (e.g. which rooms have been visited and when), it 
can provide behaviour data (e.g. has a meal been prepared), it 
can provide decision context data (e.g. the item being 
interrogated), and can be interfaced to automated systems (such 
as in smart-homes and care-spaces). 
Fig. 5. Interaction prototype using RFID, barcodes and speech. 
As decisions can be impulsive and irrational, it is also 
possible that mobile devices could be used to assess emotions 
to enhance decision support. For instance, there is currently 
much interest in Kansei Engineering as a methodology to deal 
with human feelings, demands, and impressions in context-
 aware applications. It is a Japanese term meaning sensibility, 
impression, and emotion [25] and Kansei words provide 
adjectives describing human emotion, sensibility and 
impression. Analysis of texts, voice calls and other interactions 
therefore provide the opportunity to capture an implicit 
measure of emotion-state. Furthermore, humans are sensors 
into their own states, and so explicit ‘state’ data can also be 
collected through mobile interfaces. For example, the prototype 
system shown in Figure 6 allows speakers to assess reactions to 
their presentations in real-time. It could be used to nudge 
performance in real-time, based on emotional response (as well 
as accessed later for debriefing and improvement planning). A 
clear advantage of incorporating both Kansei-like and 
questionnaire-like data is that they capture very different, yet 
complimentary, types of psychophysiological data.

IV. MICRO-EDUCATION AND COMPETENCY
 Many areas of higher education are moving toward virtual 
content, either to supplement courses on a physical campus, or 
as the primary route to qualifications (see [26] for full 
discussion of the virtual campus concept). In the Cloud, this is 
often achieved through course-management systems (e.g. 
Moodle), distributed multimedia [27] and virtual laboratories. 
Virtual laboratories, in particular, are becoming central to 
online education, having been described as ‘crucial to the 
future of learning’ [28] and for physical systems importantly 
allow for learning through repetition [29]. As an example, the 
virtual laboratory of Figure 7 provides a complete simulation 
of measurement equipment used in geophysics, including 
mixed 2D and 3D graphics. Using HTML5 on mobile devices, 
virtual laboratories can enable learn-anywhere education that 
goes far beyond simple text, images and video. 
In general, virtual education is provided as part of complete 
qualifications, such as undergraduate and postgraduate degrees. 
However, that need not be so in the context of nudging, as it 
can be argued that even small, incremental, knowledge gains 
can nudge people toward improved decision making. In that 
regard, the Open University (open.ac.uk) is relevant, as it 
provides modular courses that can be used individually (e.g. for 
interest or continual professional development), combined to 
form qualifications (certificates, diplomas and degrees), or 
studied free of charge through open-access content if no 
accreditation is required. They also provide small ‘taster’ 
courses, as well as making significant use of online assessment. 
It is evident that people paying for such online education 
realise that it will benefit their knowledge, experience, and 
decision-making abilities. So, it can also be argued that it is a 
form of ‘self-nudging’, when applied as domain-specific 
knowledge (i.e. expert knowledge is often of less use when 
applied generally). 
Fig. 7. A cloud-based virtual laboratory [26]. 
Furthermore, education is widely valued as an indicator of 
‘good judgement’ and so it can be hypothesised to also be a 
good indicator of quality in online crowd-mediated decision 
systems. For instance, the CrowdMed website uses a points 
system to indicate users with the highest success rates [13], 
which relies on a posteriori knowledge-creation. Integrating 
micro-education into the system would allow a priori
 knowledge integration. That could be considered critical as 
268259
prior success does not fully illustrate knowledge-transferability 
between domains, whereas micro-qualifications can be 
classified in terms of their applicability to individual choices: 
i.e. they represent specific-competencies rather than simply 
knowledge-levels. Micro-education need not, of course, be 
expensive. It can also be undertaken fully through online 
content, particularly virtual laboratories, that allow automated 
content-serving, testing and accreditation. However, it is 
possible that small donations by decision makers could be used 
for crowd-funding of micro-modules, with crowd-mediated 
assignment of funds based on knowledge of current education 
state, prior success rate and the importance of the study topic-
 area (i.e. education and decision contexts). 
V. INTEGRATION INTO CYBERSPACE
 The increasing complexity of computer systems over recent 
decades enhances the power of the metaphor of cyberspace, 
with users existing as cybernauts within it. The core aspects of 
cyberspace can be argued to have become more prevalent with 
the advent of Web 2.0: particularly the increased reliance on 
social media and the (heavily machine and device mediated: 
see [30]) human-to-human communications options it 
facilitates. Similarly, it can be argued that ‘the Cloud’ has 
further developed Cyberspace, making data, applications and 
social connections not only un-locatable for users, but also 
largely intangible assets. As users we can navigate it in many 
ways, including through hypertext and virtual reality, making 
cyberspace a ‘place’ where virtual existence can be anything 
from superficial to fully-immersive. 
Cyberspace is also now a place populated not just with 
human decision makers: for instance, intelligent decision-based 
systems and agents now abound. That change largely relies on 
data-mining of big-data, with many businesses now reliant on 
software to analyse-and-decide, such as in financial markets 
where much trading is now automated. The size of datasets 
(potentially many petabytes) in big-data analysis, and the speed 
at which data can be added, dictate that human involvement 
will become increasingly less demanding into the future. 
Therefore, there is no reason why the power of big-data should 
not be proposed as a means of augmenting human decision 
making by providing, and framing, decision-related 
information that facilitates ethical and life-improving decision 
outcomes. 
When based on big-data that allows humans to make 
decisions that are data-aware, allowing them to leverage the 
power of big-data analysis that is as dynamic over time as their 
needs, and even based on almost-real-time sensing (e.g. the 
web-of-things). Therefore, the systems described herein are not 
entirely new, being an extension of the use of data-aware 
agents and systems in business to application for humans in 
their daily lives. So, our research around nudging and 
technology is being based on the need not to create cyberspace 
anew, but allowing its design to evolve as a means of 
supporting environmentally-sustainable and life-improving 
choices. Therefore, integrating machine-knowledge, human-
 knowledge and micro-education can be seen as a means of 
attempting to ensure cyberspace can be considered both 
paternal and libertarian. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS
 It must be apparent to all readers that limited-rationality in 
human life often results in poor decision making that impacts 
on the three pillars of sustainable development: individual, 
societal, and environmental cost. This may be due to factors 
such as decision time, impulsivity, domain-specific knowledge, 
and misunderstanding decision-risks. So, improving decisions 
could be considered to require filling gaps between decision-
 descriptions and user-experience, which has obvious parallels 
with the ethos of academia. Therefore, a rationale has been 
proposed for development of technological systems that aid in 
ensuring decision-makers have access to the knowledge they 
need for objective, rational, decisions that shape their, and our, 
futures in a more positive direction. 
For instance, advances in massively-parallel computing, 
and cloud knowledge-bases, can allow almost-instantaneous 
access to domain-knowledge and objective advice. In parallel, 
integration of the cloud-of-things allows us to take advantage 
of dynamic knowledge of the world around us, including user-
 specific environment and physiological data. Together with 
other context data (e.g. location services, RFID, barcodes, and 
even emotions) it allows significant service-personalization for 
users, as well as increased, and more relevant, data on which 
machines and crowds can base their advice. 
However, the potential for academia to contribute to such 
an undertaking must not be underestimated. For instance, 
research can be considered the generation of knowledge to 
benefit human-kind. Massive amounts of data are generated 
annually in academia, and could be used as the basis for 
knowledge-bases for improved decision-making. Furthermore, 
a central goal of education is to provide skills, knowledge and 
experience that can be abstracted by learners to new decision-
 scenarios. It therefore explicitly seeks to enhance decision-
 making: to minimise risk and maximise ethical, technological 
and socially-acceptable outcomes. 
Therefore, micro-education has been proposed as a means 
of enhancing crowd involvement, potentially including crowd-
 funded learning opportunities to ‘micro-nudge’ crowd-
 knowledge toward objective and ethical social norms. So, in 
conclusion, this paper does not argue that technology can be 
considered a tool for use in nudging, rather it argues that a well 
developed system integrating individual users, crowds, web-
 content, machine-knowledge, micro-education and the cloud-
 of-things, provides an opportunity to augment humans such 
that they can make the efficacious and ethical decisions they 
often desire. In so doing, cyberspace may become both paternal 
and libertarian, supporting a positive and ethical future for 
humankind.
