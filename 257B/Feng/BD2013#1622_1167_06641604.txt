Abstract--With the advancement of digital image technology, 
the big change in the camera market is that digital single-lens 
reflex cameras (DSLRs) have replaced film type single-lens 
reflex cameras, which have seen very little development lately. 
This advancement is reflected in some core technologies of 
DSLRs such as digital image sensors and electronic shutter 
mechanisms, which have allowed taking photographs even in the 
toughest conditions. Therefore, as a disruptive technology, the 
developments in DSLR technologies are worthy of notice. 
This paper utilizes technology forecast using data 
envelopment analysis (TFDEA), which is a quantitative 
forecasting method. In the study, we use input and output data 
collected from about a hundred DSLRs of the top five currently 
dominant brands such as Canon, Nikon, Sony, Pentax and 
Olympus. Final results show future DSLRs’ capabilities and 
provide insight that TFDEA, as a forecasting method, can be 
applicable to determine market trends of consumer electronics 
as well as technologies. Furthermore, the results showed that 
market segmentation provided more reliable and accurate 
results with lower mean absolute deviation (MAD) value while 
all camera market approach provided less accurate results with 
a high standard deviation or MAD value. 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
With the advancement of digital image technology, the 
big change in the camera market is that digital single-lens 
reflex cameras (DSLRs) have replaced film type single-lens 
reflex cameras, which have seen very little development 
lately. This advancement is reflected in some core 
technologies of DSLRs such as digital image sensors and 
electronic shutter mechanisms, which have allowed taking 
photographs even in the toughest conditions. Today, DSLR 
cameras are becoming more popular among photographers 
and enthusiasts. There are a lot of advantages of DSLRs 
compared with the compact point and shoot cameras, for 
example; the bigger sensor size, several choices of lens, high 
image quality, higher level of camera control and versatility 
for shooting in any light condition, which makes a DSLR a 
good choice for most of professional photographers as well as 
amateurs [1]. As of 2012, there are seven manufactures 
dominating the DSLRS’ market for a generation or more. 
These manufacturers are; Canon Inc., Nikon Corp, Sony Corp, 
Olympus Corp, Pentax, Fuji and Panasonic Corp. They all 
have their own representative products of DSLRs. 
The data from Camera & Imaging Products Association 
(CIPA) is a good proxy for discovering trend in the camera 
industry. Based on CIPA’s data, revenue from DSLR cameras 
is growing slowly and the unit shipments are growing albeit 
at a much slower pace. Fig. 1 shows the total unit shipped of 
DSLR cameras and basic cameras[2]. The forecast for total 
shipment (the cumulative total of shipments from January to 
December) of DSLR cameras in 2010 is 109.9 million units, a 
year-on-year increase of 3.8% [3].  
 
 
Fig. 1 Total unit shipped of DSLR cameras and basic cameras from CIPA [2] 
 
Trends in the DSLRs camera market have implications on 
other technologies. For example, higher resolution of digital 
camera sensors results in bigger file size which requires 
improvement of memory card technology to be able to handle 
larger files in terms of the capacity and writing speed, the 
improvement of in-camera image processor chip to be able to 
process image quickly, and the improvement of computer 
hardware to be able to support massive image file processing. 
The potential benefit of the result would assist all the 
manufacturers to get ready to promote their competitive 
products and other industries to get ready to adapt to the 
change in technology.  
 
II. LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
A. Technology Forecasting 
Technological forecasting is aimed at predicting future 
technological capabilities, attributes, and parameters. That is, 
a technological capability or attribute can be forecast to be 
available at some time in the future [4].  
Methods for technology forecasting are broadly classified 
into two main categories: exploratory forecasting and 
normative forecasting. Exploratory forecasting means 
forecasting the future based on past data and present 
conditions. A good choice of a technology forecasting 
method in a particular situation could affect the usefulness 
and accuracy of the forecast [5].  
 
B. DEA – Data Envelopment Analysis 
The DEA model was introduced in the 1970s, and for 
many years, it got recognized relatively quickly. Their work 
2116
 2013 Proceedings of PICMET '13: Technology Management for Emerging Technologies.
 
Fig. 2 The general structure of a DEA model (envelopment form) [7] 
 
extended the theory underlying DEA, made progress 
enhancing the computational aspects of the analysis, and 
reported on selected applications. As application catches up 
with theory, the DEA model promises to find more 
significant use in the future [6].  
The purpose of DEA is to determine which of the DMUs 
make efficient use of their inputs and which do not. For the 
inefficient units, the analysis can actually quantify what 
levels of improved performance should be attainable. In 
addition, the analysis indicates where an inefficient DMU 
might look for benchmarking help as it searches for ways to 
improve [6].  Fig. 2 shows the general structure of a DEA 
model. 
 
C. TFDEA – Technology Forecasting using Data 
Envelopment Analysis 
“Technology Forecasting Using Data Envelopment 
Analysis” (TFDEA) was introduced in 2001 [8]. TFDEA is 
an extension of “Data Envelopment Analysis” (DEA) as an 
operation research method. After its introduction, TFDEA 
has been a favorable approach to obtain technological 
predictions [9]. One fundamental concept for TFDEA is 
being “state-of-the-art (SOA)” technology, which indicates a 
technology’s superiority over the others for the time being 
that the analysis is performed. If a technology is SOA, its 
efficiency score is assigned as 1, by considering the historical 
levels of performance. TFDEA assigns the subsequent 
efficiency scores for each of the remaining technologies 
based on the preceding SOA technology [9]. 
In TFDEA, we need an efficiency score at the time of 
release and against what is assumed to be the current time (or 
the period at which the frontier is considered frozen). These 
are denoted by an R or C respectively [10]. Technology 
Forecasting with Data Envelopment Analysis (TFDEA) 
offers an effective means to determine technological 
capability over time without the burden of fixed a-priori 
weighting schemes [10]. TFDEA explains advancement of 
technology by capturing dynamics of efficiencies over time. 
Hence, it requires series of efficiency measurement based on 
DEA (Data Envelopment Analysis) [11]. 
 
III. MODEL AND DATA 
 
A. Model 
Many variables have been considering in the project for 
forecasting the DSLR camera technology. However, not all 
the characteristics that use in marketing can be used in 
forecast this technology such as megapixel and ISO. The 
technical characteristics would be constructed into structural 
variables; MSRP and weight of the DSLR cameras (used to 
achieve better performance) and functional variables; 
resolution, focus point, and max FPS as shown in Fig. 3 
below. A clear explanation of the characteristics is given in 
the paper for a better understanding.   
 
 
Fig. 3 Basic input-output model of DSLR cameras 
 
The method used is the forecasting of technology using 
data envelopment analysis first proposed in PICMET 2001 by 
Anderson et al [12]. Lim and Anderson succeeded in 
developing the add-in program for running TFDEA in 
Microsoft Excel [11]. The program comes with some specific 
options needed to be set before running the program as 
followed.

Fig. 4 Application Programing Interface (API) dialogue box 
 
B. Frontier 
There are two options that need to consider under the 
define frontier, Static and Dynamic frontier. However, when 
choosing the target frontier, it should be based on the nature 
of technology itself. Some of them are developed every year 
same as the DSLR technology, and the other might be for 
every three to five years. Moreover, after choosing frontier 
type, the target frontier has to decide which data set will be 
the forecasting period, and which set will be the learning 
period [10]. 
 
C. Return to Scale 
Under the return to scale option, there are four types of 
return to scale: constant return to scale (CRS), increasing 
return to scale (IRS), decreasing return to scale (DRS) and 
variable return to scale (VRS). The state-of-art of technology 
and the change of efficiency will depend upon the return to 
scale. Therefore, it is important to choose the right option. In 
this study, to consider economy of scale which exists in this 
industry, CRS is deployed [13].   
 
D. Orientation 
Lastly, orientation has to be chosen to running the 
program between input orientation and output orientation. 
There is no specific methodology to choose because it 
depends on the nature of technology and the purpose of the 
decision makers. For the input-oriented model, the objective 
function is minimizing the investment or the input while the 
function variable level remains the same. In another word, 
using less input while getting the same output. However, the 
output-oriented model will increase the efficiency by 
maximizing the output while using the same level of input. 
That means producing more output while not paying more 
money for the input [14]. For forecasting the DSLR cameras 
technology in this paper, Dynamic frontier year with output-
 orientation and CRS will be selected to observe the result. 
However, more explanation will be described in the result 
section.

This study focuses exclusively on DSLR cameras 
excluding lens range from cropped sensor cameras such as 
Micro four-third, APS-C, and APS-H, to 35mm Full Frame 
cameras in the U.S. market. It does not include other types of 
digital cameras such as point and shoot, super zoom, mirror-
 less, and medium format cameras. The data is collected from 
several sources such as the manufacturer's official websites, 
digital photography reviews from www.dpreview.com, 
www.imaging-resource.com, and from www.dxomark.com. 
In total, 115 DSLR cameras from 5 manufactures from 1999 
to 2012 were used.  Table 1 below represents a sample of 
DSLR cameras data in semi-professional category sorted by 
year. 
 
F. MSRP 
There are two kinds of prices in DSLR camera market: the 
manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) and the street 
price. The MSRP is the price of a DSLR camera when it is 
officially announced by its manufacturer. This study focuses 
on the MSRP of DSLR camera body only excluding lens in 
U.S dollar. From our observation, the trend of MSRP is 
different depending on the type of DSLR cameras. Fig. 5 
illustrates the trend of MSRP of DSLR cameras of five 
manufacturers with respect to time. 
 
G. Weight 
Weight is used as one of the structural characteristics for a 
DSLR camera to deliver functions. In this study, we focus on 
the weight of DSLR camera body only excluding lens, 
battery, and memory cards, and it is measured in pound (lb). 
Weights of DSLR cameras are different depending on the 
types of cameras. In general, the weights increase from entry 
to professional DSLR cameras. From our observation, the 
weight trend of each DSLR camera type is likely to be slowly 
decreasing. The Fig. 6 illustrates the trend of DSLR camera 
body weight with respect to time.

H. Resolution 
Resolution is one of the most important characteristics of 
DSLR cameras and the first criteria that highly effects buyer's 
decision. Effective resolution represents the amount of details 
that a camera sensor can capture and it is measured in pixels. 
DSLR cameras with higher effective resolution can capture 
more details which results in better image quality and makes 
it suitable for those landscape and studio photographers who 
need extremely high resolution for very large prints. In 
general, professional DSLR cameras especially the high-end 
flagship DSLR cameras, such as EOS 1Ds Mark III series 
from Canon and Nikon D3X, offer the highest pixel count 
than any type of the cameras in the same generation. From 
1999 to 2012, the DSLR camera's resolutions have been 
increasing as the sensor technology developed. The Fig. 7 
illustrates the improvement of effective resolution of DSLR 
cameras with respect to time. 
 
I. Max FPS 
Max FPS stands for the maximum of frames per second 
that a DSLR camera can shoot in high continues or burst 
mode. Max FPS is referred as the speed of DSLR cameras 
and it is a very important tool for sport photographers. DSLR 
cameras regularly provide different FPS depending on the 
type of the cameras.  
 
J. Focus point 
Number of focus points is also one of the most important 
characteristics of DSLR cameras, which determines the 
wideness of area coverage in a frame that a DSLR camera 
can focus.  The larger the number of focus points, the better 
and wider coverage that a camera can track and focus within 
a frame. Each type of DSLR cameras provides different 
metering and focusing systems which result in different 
numbers of focus points. Generally, number of focus points 
also distinguishes the type of DLSR cameras and the market.

IV. METHODOLOGY 
 
A. TFDEA Procedure 
To use TFDEA for technology foresight, we must first 
determine the time period of analysis; identify the main 
indicators of SOA (State Of Art) that characterize the 
products. Then, based on indicators, we should determine a 
TFDEA model type, collect data, and solve TFDEA model 
with optimization software. Last, we need to analyze the 
results, validate the model, and draw forecasting chart for 
conclusions. This is done for each time period presented in 
the data set following the procedure.  
 
B. Identify indicators 
The output-oriented TFDEA model is illustrated in the 
flow chart presented as:

In the data, we included year, MSRP, weight, resolution, 
max FPS, and Focus Points as our main indicators. We 
choose output-oriented TFDEA model to calculate base on 
our project objective. The basic structural properties of DSLR 
camera are price, weight and size, which are selected as 
structural indicators. Resolution, max FPS, and Focus Point 
are selected as functional indicators.  
Conceptually, TFDEA calls for testing each technology. 
The technological rate of change, ?, for product k at any time, 
t, is represented by ???  [11]. Briefly, x?,? represents the ith input 
and y?,?  represents the rth output of technology k. The 
variable ????  also serves as the objective function and 
represents the amount of additional output which should be 
achievable by technology k at time period t? if k were state-
 of-art at that time. The variables ??,? describe how much of 
technology j is used in setting a target of performance for 
technology k. According to TFDEA method, the algorithm is 
shown as above in Fig. 10. 
To predict the characteristics of DSLR camera technology 
in 2012 and beyond, we need the past technical 
characteristics of comparable DSLR camera. Thus we 
examined indicators for the data collected from the more than 
100 DSLR to obtain the ideal result by trying on different 
types of inputs and outputs combination.  
 
V. RESULTS 
 
Table 2 illustrates the best-fit result of the model. 
Dynamic frontier year is selected to use the effective date to 
define the second goal as maximum value. Output orientation 
model is used because DSLR trend tends to improve 
resolution and frame per second (FPS) more than weight and 
price. Therefore, finding how the output of the DSLR 
technology is increased at the same level of input is our goal. 
CRS imply that outputs are increased in the same proportion 
inputs. The Average Rate of Change is shown at 1.244200, 
which means DSLR efficiency is improved around 24 percent 
every year. Frontier year at 2006 means the dataset is divided 
into before 2006, at 2006 and after 2006. MAD (Mean 
Absolute Deviation) is 1.767841, which means it could be 21 
months error when this forecasting model is applied to the 
DSLR model. The second portion of the table illustrates that 
the model uses 2 inputs, MSRP and weight, and 3 outputs, 
resolution, Max FPS and FP, for forecasting DSLR 
technology. There are 50 cameras of the 115 analyzed that 
are State of Art (SOA) when they are released to the market 
and 10 cameras are still the SOA in 2006. 12 out of 50 state-
 of-art cameras are used to calculate the rate of change. 7 
technologies are released before forecasted date, and 67 
cameras are released after forecasted date.

The Fig. 11 shows the result chart of DSLR technology at 
frontier year 2006 with 2 inputs and 3 outputs. From the 
chart, there are some technologies that are located on the 
diagonal line, which means it is perfect forecasting. However, 
most of the forecasted camera technologies are not located on 
the SOA line, which can be the mean absolute deviation error 
of 21 months.   
 
VI. DISCUSSION 
 
A. Effect of Market Segmentation 
In the model and data section, the DSLR market can be 
divided into several market segmentations; professional, 
semi-professional, mid-range and entry market. And, in 
general, each market requires different characteristics. For 
example, in the professional DSLR market, photographers 
prefer higher performance and ruggedness, while entry level 
photographers want affordable price of cameras. Therefore, 
when a particular segment of dataset used in this research is 
analyzed with TFDEA, the result might show distinguishable 
characteristics of the market segments. The Fig. 12 and 13 
show forecasting results of two ranges of datasets, 
professional and semi-professional markets. In here, in case 
of semi-professional cameras, the learning period is relatively 
shorter than the professional market. Therefore, considering 
enough the learning period, the frontier year is set to 2008 
because the first camera in semi-professional market was 
released in 2002 while the first professional camera was 
released in 1999.  
 
 
 
Fig. 12 Forecasting results of the professional market 
 
 
Fig. 13 Forecasting results of the semi-professional market 
 
In these two results, MAD is lower than the forecasting 
results of all dataset without considering segmentation. This 
means smaller forecasting error and more accurate 
forecasting results. In addition, compared with all range 
market, the results in which market range is reflected have 
smaller differences between released date and forecasted date 
like the table 3.  
As a result, considering market segmentation in TFDEA is 
reasonable to get more credible forecasting results. In other 
words, if distinct market segmentation exists such as this 
research, we need to use different inputs and outputs 
according to the circumstances. 
 
VII. CONCLUSION 
 
A. Limitation 
An analysis of validation of previous camera data to 
forecast the camera technology in the future by including all 
the cameras in the market from professional to low-end 
cameras to the model seemed to be inapplicable with the 
result of high in standard deviation (MAD) since different 
camera market ranges result in different levels of camera 
technology. In case of the professional cameras which are 
considered to be the most versatile cameras to capture image 
in any light conditions, the lack of the usable ISO data as a 
functional characteristic to some of cameras is the missing 
measurement of camera efficiency and the result could be 
biased. The maximum ISO could be considered as an 
alternative output but it is left unused since it is not an 
accurate indicator of cameras to be considered high-ISO 
performers.

There are other several outputs that are interesting and 
should be included in the model since DSLR cameras are 
compelling than other types of camera but with the limitation 
of the model, only a maximum of 3 outputs can be applied. 
With the time constraint, the DLSR cameras in mid-range 
and entry markets were left to be forecasted in this report. 
Additionally, some MSRP in entry DSLR camera market can 
be considered invalid since they are sold with lens kit and 
there is no accurate MSRP of entry DSLR camera bodies 
only available which the result could be potentially 
inaccurate. 
 
B. Future Work 
Since DSLR cameras in mid-range and low-end markets 
were left and these two markets are considerably larger than 
semi-profession and professional camera markets, forecasting 
technology changes in these markets is interesting and should 
be considered to be a future work. 
Different DSLR cameras markets have different 
technology priorities. For example, professional cameras are 
designed for those professional photographers who demand 
speed and versatility to capture images in any light conditions 
rather than resolution. Therefore, considering prioritizing the 
outputs with weights for each camera market can be a future 
work to improve the result.
