 AbstractÑWireless sensor networks generate big-data which
 leads to overwhelming traffic in the networks. Compressed
 sensing (CS) can exploit signal sparsity to reduce the amount of
 traffic. We evaluate the performance of 1-bit CS with a circulant
 random bipolar measurement matrix. The results show that 1-
 bit CS can decrease traffic at higher degree in wireless sensor
 networks compared to the conventional CS. Moreover, applying
 a circulant random bipolar measurement matrix overcomes the
 limitation of memory in sensor nodes. The scheme is studied
 in terms of reconstruction accuracy and memory consumption
 by using real sensor data. The implementation on sensor nodes
 validates the viability on a practical system.
 I. INTRODUCTION
 Compressed sensing (CS) [1] exploits signal sparsity to
 reduce the amount of traffic generated from a big-data tech-
 nology e.g., wireless sensor networks (WSNs). The sensor
 data usually exhibits correlation among data which can be
 represented as sparse data in some domain. Lower power
 consumption for data transmission and server storage memory
 can be expected by applying the CS-based data compression.
 1-bit CS can improve the performance of traffic reduction in
 wireless sensor networks while applying a circulant random
 bipolar measurement addresses the limitation of memory in
 sensor nodes.
 CS conventionally represents high-dimensional signals in
 the form of smaller number of measurements by using ran-
 domized, linear, non-adaptive measurements. The conventional
 CS assumes that the measurements are real valued and have
 infinite bit precision. However, in practice the measurements
 are quantized into finite number of bits. In an extreme case,
 Boufounos et al. introduced Ò1-bit CSÓ which uses only 1-
 bit quantization representing sign of the measurements [2].
 Although more measurements are necessary in 1-bit CS, it
 can finally decrease the number of bits from the original high
 resolution quantized bitstream.
 WSNs are composed of large number of distributed nodes,
 which capture huge amount of data and communicate with
 each other via wireless communication. The small sensor
 nodes usually have limited processing power, limited energy,
 and scarce memory. This work focuses on applying CS without
 violating the memory limitation which is crucial because it
 determines the feasibility of a desired application. A mea-
 surement matrix used in the CS measurement is stored in
 sensor nodesÕ limited memory, and it is accounted as main
 memory space consumption of CS data processing algorithm.
 Since 1-bit CS requires more measurements which result in
 larger memory consumed by a measurement matrix, a circulant
 structured matrix [3] with entries randomly generated by
 Fig. 1: Block diagram of compressed sensing.
 Bernoulli distribution is introduced to cope with the memory
 issue.
 In this paper we evaluate the performance of memory-
 efficient 1-bit CS which adopts a circulant random bipolar
 measurement matrix by using real sensor data including tem-
 perature, relative humidity, and illuminance. The results show
 that the proposed scheme can reduce the traffic and save
 significant amount of memory compared to the conventional
 CS under same conditions. Furthermore, the experiment on
 real sensor nodes is also conducted to verify our scheme.
 II. CS BACKGROUND
 When the original signals can be expressed as a large
 number of zero or nearly zero values and a small number of
 non-zero values, the signals are said to be Òsparse.Ó CS is
 a state-of-the-art data compression and reconstruction theory
 that exploits the fact that many natural signals are sparse or
 compressible in an appropriate basis such as Fourier, Discrete
 Cosine Transform (DCT), and Discrete Wavelet Transform
 (DWT) etc [1], [4].
 Figure 1 shows the block diagram of CS. CS measurement
 is performed in data sources which is sensor nodes in our
 consideration. A measurement vector y which is an outcome
 of CS measurement is transmitted along the network to a root
 node to reconstruct the original signal. The root node which is
 usually a relatively high performance computer firstly finds a
 sparse solution s according to l1-norm minimization problem
 and then transform the sparse solution to a reconstructed signal
 corresponding to a sparsifying basis.
 Unlike thresholding-based transformation compressions
 which also exploit the signal sparsity in some domains by

extracting high coefficients as an output, the encoding part
 of CS is universal among sensor data. The same encoding
 process can be done even when different sensor data are
 sparse in different domains. The sensor nodes do not require
 a knowledge of which domain the data is sparse. In another
 aspect, the reconstruction performance of CS is improvable
 ceaselessly. Given CS measurements stored in a server, the
 discovery of better sparsifying basis for the data can be applied
 at the reconstruction process to improve the reconstruction
 performance.
 III. 1-BIT CS WITH STRUCTURED MEASUREMENT
 A. 1-bit CS
 When reducing traffic at high rate, the conventional CS
 suffers from insufficient measurements and results in high
 distortion from reconstruction. Therefore, we are interested
 in 1-bit CS where each measurement is quantized into one
 bit of sign information. At a given target number of bits of
 compressed data, 1-bit CS can increase the number of mea-
 surement. Despite of low resolution quantization, the additional
 measurements which may even exceed the number of original
 signal can improve the reconstruction accuracy and therefore
 lower distortion by 1-bit CS can be expected.
 Let a length-N signal vector x be represented as a sparse
 vector s with the relationship x = ?s where ? is a basis
 matrix. In 1-bit CS measurement, the original signal vector x
 is compressed by an measurement matrix ? as follows
 y = sign(?x) (1)
 where y denotes the length-M acquired CS measurement
 vector. sign() function returns 1 for positive numbers and ?1
 for negative numbers. Note that the conventional CS assumes
 that the measurements y are real valued and have infinite bit
 precision. Therefore Eq. (1) becomes y = ?x. However, in
 practice measurements y have to be quantized to a discrete
 value over some finite range before being further processed.
 Let a system quantization be B bits. A total compression
 rate including quantization Rc is defined as the ratio between
 the number of bits required for a compressed and an original
 signal such that Rc = Mconv/N for the conventional CS and
 Rc = M1bit/BN for 1-bit CS.
 Although the amplitude information is lost during 1-bit
 measurement stage, the reconstruction method [2] was pro-
 posed to enforce that the sparse solution s lies on the unit
 sphere and the l1 norm minimization problem becomes
 min ?s?1 subject to y = sign(??s), ?s?2 = 1. (2)
 As a comparison between the conventional and 1-bit CS,
 1-bit CS can increase the number of measurement to BRcN
 compared to that of the conventional CS at RcN at a given
 target number of bits of compressed data. However, due to
 larger measurement matrix, memory requirement of 1-bit CS
 are increased by a factor of B to store the larger measurement
 matrix.
 B. Structured Measurement
 Generally, we require that coherence between the measure-
 ment matrix ? and the basis ? is small enough. A good
 choice for the measurement matrix ? is random matrices. In
 this work we consider two classes of sub-Gaussian distribution
 measurement matrix, namely Gaussian and bipolar random
 matrix. Since entries in bipolar random matrix are only 1
 and ?1 which can be represented by only 1 bit, the use of
 bipolar random matrix as a measurement matrix can save some
 memory.
 Instead of storing the fully random measurement matrix
 which occupies large memory space, applying partial random
 structured matrices as measurement matrices is encouraged. It
 has been shown that circulant random matrices with entries
 generated independently from the same distributions are also
 sufficient to satisfy the RIP (restricted isometry geometry) with
 high probability [5]. Given a stem vector c = (c0, ..., ci)T
 where i = max (M, N), the circulant matrix can be drawn as
 C =

 c1 c0 á á á c2
 .
 .
 .
 .
 .
 .

 ci?1 ci?2 á á á c0

 In the conventional CS, we are interested when a number of
 raw signal N is larger than a number of measurement M , the
 measurement matrix will be a row submatrix of C. However,
 in most cases of 1-bit CS, a number of measurement M
 grows larger than a number of raw signal N . The constructed
 measurement matrix will be a column submatrix of C.
 By using the circulant matrix, the memory required for
 storing measurement matrices is reduced significantly. The
 memory for storing conventional CS measurement matrices is
 reduced to O(N), unlike fully random matrices which occupy
 O(RcN2). In the M > N 1-bit CS case, structured matrices
 consume O(BRcN) memory, while fully random matrices use
 O(BRcN2). This comparison is done based on a given fixed
 number of target compressed bits so that we can compare
 between the conventional CS and 1-bit CS.
 IV. EVALUATION
 We evaluate the performance of 1-bit CS with circulant
 random bipolar measurement by using real sensor data includ-
 ing temperature, relative humidity, illuminance of visible light
 (320 nm to 730 nm). The raw data is sensed by using TelosB
 wireless sensor nodes [6].
 A. Simulation
 We compare the introduced scheme with the conventional
 CS and a fully random Gaussian measurement, and their
 combinations. The conventional CS uses B = 16 bits for
 quantization. GPSR [7] and BIHT [8] are used as reconstruc-
 tion algorithms for the conventional and 1-bit CS, respectively.
 DCT basis is employed as our sparsifying basis. The eval-
 uation is done in MATLAB by using 10-day data collected
 from 83 sensors. The data are compressed and reconstructed
 independently every hour (120 samples). It is worthwhile to
 notice that the signal vector x is consistently removed the DC

 Note that B represents bit resolution and a compression rate Rc is defined the ratio
 between the number of bits required for a compressed and an original signal.
 Figure 2 shows the accuracy performance in terms of
 average absolute error at a corresponding compression rate
 of all three evaluated data. The results of different kinds of
 sensor data all agree to the same conclusion. As mentioned in
 Section III-A, the convention CS undergoes inadequate number
 of measurements that further lose more degree of freedom
 when using the structured matrix. As a result, applying the
 circulant random matrix to the conventional CS is undesirable
 option unlike using it with 1-bit CS. In 1-bit CS the distortion
 is slightly enhanced. In particularly, when the compression rate
 is 0.1, the distortion increased from when using fully random
 measurement matrix to when using circulant measurement
 matrix is elaborated as the following numbers: from 0.06?C
 to 0.08?C for temperature, from 0.18%RH to 0.24%RH for
 humidity, and from 11.7 lux to 12.9 lux for illuminance. There-
 fore, it is worthwhile to obtain significantly more compact
 measurement matrix.
 B. Experiment
 The implementation of the proposed scheme illustrates the
 feasibility on real sensor nodes. We implemented it on TelosB
 nodes whose ROM memory is 48 KB. A sensor acquires
 the data from an outdoor environment every 30 seconds and
 transmits by using reliable data collection protocol [6]. At
 compression rate of 0.1, the proposed scheme consumes only
 24 B for storing a measurement matrix, while the fully random
 Gaussian measurement matrix occupies up to 2.9 KB and 46
 KB in case of the conventional and 1-bit CS, respectively.
 Figure 3 shows an example of 1-day data with its reconstruc-
 tion. The maximum absolute errors of each sensor data are
 0.37?C, 0.42%RH, and 79 lux for temperature, humidity, and
 illuminance, respectively. In short, the scheme decreases 90%
 of traffic without significant effect on memory consumption
 and accuracy.
 C. Discussion
 Table I summarizes the characteristics of the conventional
 CS and 1-bit CS with different measurement matrices ac-
 cording to the calculation in Section III-B and the evaluation
 in Section IV-A. Notably, 1-bit CS with the structured mea-
 surement matrix achieves memory-efficient with sufficiently
 low distortion which suits to memory-limited applications
 employing small sensor nodes.
 In this work, we evaluate the reconstruction accuracy in
 terms of distortion which is measured in absolute difference
 in real world unit because it can give an idea on real application
 and also be comparable to a sensor performance. The TelosB
 wireless sensor nodes are equipped with an SHT11 humidity
 and temperature sensor. The SHT11Õs temperature sensing can
 provide ±0.5?C at 25?C accuracy with ±0.1?C repeatability,

 and the accuracy of ±3.5%RH along with the repeatability
 of ±0.1%RH for the relative humidity. The results show that
 the CS-based compression and reconstruction can achieve
 the same order of error with the sensor performance. The
 reconstruction of temperature and relative humidity data are
 considerably accurate enough for most monitoring applica-
 tions. On the other hand, the fluctuating illuminance data
 cannot be recovered precisely at the abrupt peak. The sharp
 peak results in low sparsity in DCT domain, and therefore the
 illuminance data has least degree of compressibility compared
 to other two data.
 V. CONCLUSION
 This paper shows an empirical study of 1-bit compressed
 sensing with a circulant random bipolar measurement on real
 sensor data which consists of temperature, relative humidity,
 and illuminance. The evaluation results demonstrate that in
 case of resource-limited wireless sensor networks, one may
 consider the circulant bipolar measurement matrix operating
 in 1-bit CS scheme as an outstanding candidate. The imple-
 mentation on real sensor nodes also reveals the feasibility of
 the introduced scheme practically.
