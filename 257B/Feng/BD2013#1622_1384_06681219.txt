 Abstract—The changing demographic profile of the 
population has potentially challenging social, geopolitical, and 
financial consequences for individuals, families, the wider society, 
and governments globally. The demographic change will result in 
a rapidly growing elderly population with healthcare 
implications which importantly include Alzheimer type 
conditions (a leading cause of dementia). Dementia requires long 
term care to manage the negative behavioral symptoms which 
are primarily exhibited in terms of agitation and aggression as 
the condition develops. This paper considers the nature of 
dementia along with the issues and challenges implicit in its 
management. The Behavioral and Psychological Symptoms of 
Dementia (BPSD) are introduced with factors (precursors) to the 
onset of agitation and aggression. Independent living is 
considered, health monitoring and implementation in context-
 aware decision-support systems is discussed with consideration of 
data analytics. Implicit in health monitoring are technical and 
ethical constraints; we briefly consider these constraints with the 
ability to generalize to a range of medical conditions. We 
postulate that health monitoring offers exciting potential 
opportunities however the challenges lie in the effective 
realization of independent assisted living while meeting the 
ethical challenges, achieving this remains an open research 
question remains.

I. BACKGROUND
 There is a demographic time bomb that has potentially 
challenging social geopolitical and financial consequences for 
individuals, families, the wider society, and governments 
globally. The demographic change will result in a rapidly 
growing elderly population with healthcare implications which 
importantly include Alzheimer type diseases (a leading cause 
of dementia) [1]. Dementia requires long term care to manage 
the negative behavioral symptoms which are primarily 
exhibited in terms of agitation and aggression as the condition 
develops. Caring for patients with Alzheimer’s disease and 
related disorders (ADRD) is estimated to cost 80 to 100 billion 
dollars annually [1]. 
In considering the prevalence of dementia there is a direct 
correlation between the demographic changes alluded to and 
the incidence of dementia [2]. Failure to address agitation, 
detect the early signs of Behavioural and Psychological 
Symptoms of Dementia (BPSD) [2] or reacting poorly to an 
individual with agitated dementia can result in a catastrophic 
reaction. The results of BPSD are manifested in suffering, 
premature institutionalization, increased costs of care, and 
significant loss of Quality of Life (QoL) for the patient and 
h/her family and carers [2]. This brief overview identifies the 
scale of the problem and the issues around ADRD and 
dementia and demonstrates the correlation between an ageing 
population and dementia.  
To address the issues and challenges identified and provide 
for an increase in the QoL for patients (and also importantly for 
carers), while mitigating the burgeoning costs in managing 
patients with dementia and ADRD related conditions we 
postulate that e-Health monitoring implemented using “Smart-
 Spaces” as discussed in Thomas et al [3] with data processing 
in intelligent context-aware decision-support systems provides 
an effective basis for Independent Assisted Living (IAL) thus 
enabling improved QoL with improved resource utilisation and 
cost control. 
This paper considers the nature and  management of 
dementia, introduces BPSD and identifies the precursors to the 
onset of agitation and aggression in patients with dementia. 
IAL with e-Health monitoring to manage the BPSD using 
intelligent context-aware systems incorporating decision-
 support is discussed wit a discussion around data analytics. 
While health monitoring offers exciting potential opportunities 
across a range of medical conditions to improve QoL and

realize efficiencies (resource utilization and financial savings) 
there are issues which must be addressed including technical 
and ethical constraints. A brief overview of the ethical and 
technical challenges is provided with consideration of the 
ability to generalise across a range of medical conditions. 
Finally the paper closes with conclusions and directions for 
future research.  
II. DEMENTIA
 Dementia is a degenerative condition [4] and is a 
progressive cognitive disabling disease which effects around 
5% of people over 65 and in excess of 40% of people aged 
over 90. Dementia is one of the main causes of disability later 
in life, ahead of cancer, cardiovascular disease and stroke. 
Typical symptoms include: (1) memory loss, (2) speech 
impediments, (3) deteriorating thought processes, and (4) 
impaired perception and reasoning [5]. Additionally, changes 
in personality, behaviour, and mood, which include: depressive 
symptoms, apathy, agitation, and aggression [5].  
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia 
and characterised by progressive cognitive impairment with 
neuropsychiatric symptoms such as anomalous motor 
behaviour, depression, anxiety, weight loss, irritability and 
agitation. The stages dementia have been modelled in [6] based 
on the BPSD [2]. The BPSD has gained acceptance from 
health care practitioners and in computer science research; 
seminal work being conducted by, for example, Cohen-
 Mansfield et al, see [6].  
A 7 tiered conceptual model [6] sets out a graphical 
representation of BPSD in which patients with dementia are 
classified according to the severity of symptoms and their need 
for different levels of health care services, the seven tiered 
model is constructed as shown below. The prevalence 
percentages (%) are estimates; for tier 7 prevalence is the 
estimated percentage (%) of people with dementia who fall into 
this category and for tiers 5 and 6 estimates are based on 
clinical observations in, for example, [7]. 
? Tier 1: No dementia. Management: universal 
prevention, although specific strategies to prevent 
dementia remain unproven 
? Tier 2: Dementia with no BPSD. Prevalence 40%. 
Management: by selective prevention, though 
preventive or delaying interventions (not widely 
researched) 
? Tier 3: Dementia with mild BPSD – e.g., night time 
disturbance, wandering, mild depression, apathy, 
repetitive questioning, shadowing. Prevalence 30%. 
Management: by primary care workers. 
? Tier 4: Dementia with moderate BPSD – e.g., major 
depression, verbal aggression, psychoses, sexual 
inhibition, wandering. Prevalence 20%. Management: 
by specialist consultant in primary care. 
? Tier 5: Dementia with severe BPS – e.g., severe 
depression, psychoses, screaming, severe agitation. 
Prevalence 10%Management: in dementia specific 
nursing homes or by case management under a 
specialist team. 
? Tier 6: Dementia with very severe BPSD – e.g., 
physical aggression, severe depression, suicidal 
tendencies. Prevalence <1%. Management: in 
psychogeriatric or neurobehavioral units. 
? Tier 7: Dementia with extreme BPSD – e.g., physical 
violence. Prevalence rare. Management: in intensive 
specialist care unit. 
The 7 tiers point to clear demarcations between stages 
however in practice the demarcations are essentially fuzzy as 
we shall show. 
? In considering tier 1, this can be managed by regular 
consultations with healthcare professionals where 
diagnosis and management can implemented however 
while management of the condition at this level can be 
achieved specific strategies to prevent dementia remain 
unclear [5].  
? Tiers 6 and 7 require institutionalisation and retention 
of a domestic living arrangement using IAL strategies is 
impractical and potentially dangerous for both patients 
and carers. 
? Tier 5 is more problematic as management [of the 
patient] may be in: “dementia specific nursing homes or 
by case management under a specialist team”.  
Thus, for tier 5 patients the spectrum of BPSD severity 
varies; as such there may be patients within tier 5 who display 
symptoms and behaviours closely related to tier 4 behaviours 
who may be capable of remaining in a domestic environment 
while monitored. For a patient classified as tier 5 IAL is patient 
specific and whilst there may be a case made for retention of 
IAL arrangement the likelihood is that institutional care is the 
sensible option. In considering tiers 2, 3, and 4 the status’(s) 
classified under these tiers offer the optimal scope for retention 
of IAL supported by 24/7 remote monitoring using sensor 
technologies with mobile technologies.  
Based on this analysis retention of IAL for domestic 
settings can be restricted to tiers 2, 3, and 4 with possible tier 5
 patients displaying behaviours closely related to tier 4 patients 
as set out in the 7 tier model. This conclusion is supported by 
the observations in [6]; from a dementia management 
perspective the estimated prevalence of BPSD in dementia 
patients in specific tiers is: 40% for tier 2, 30% for tier 3, 20% 
for tier 4, 10% for tier 5, and 1% for tier 6. The incidence in 
tier 7 is noted as ‘rare’. In practice the clear demarcation 
between the tiers is not realistic as the boundaries are fuzzy 
however the conclusions drawn from the analysis remain valid.  
From this analysis it can be seen that the manageable tiers 
from an IAL perspective (tiers 2, 3, and 4) represent 90% of 
the population of patients with dementia and retention of IAL 
for these cases (plus the identified cases in tier 5) present 
opportunities to improve the QoL for patients and carers while 
realising significant financial savings for all stakeholders in the 
management of ADRD and dementia.

There is a large body of documented research addressing 
Alzheimer type conditions in general and dementia in 
particular [6][7][8]; the literature reviewed has focused on 
agitation and aggression as these behaviors relate to dementia. 
Agitated behavior is one of the most frequent reasons that 
patients with dementia are placed in long-term care settings. 
These behaviors are indicators of distress and are associated 
with increased risk of injury to the patients and their caregivers 
[9]. Biswas et al [10] have noted that Agitated behavior is 
common in patients with dementia and represents a challenge 
for all stakeholders in dementia management. There is a 
consensus in the literature that for dementia agitation and 
aggression represent not only a serious problem but is also 
frequently a tangible manifestation of other negative behavioral 
issues.  
III. THE PRECURSORS TO THE ONSET OF AGITATION
 The symptoms and behaviors identified as they relate to 
BPSD are addressed in [4] and are classified under 6 
neuropsychiatric symptoms: (1) anomalous motor behaviour, 
(2) depression, (3) anxiety, (4) weight loss, (5) irritability, and 
(6) agitation. These classifications provide realistic headings 
under which the precursors to manifestation of the BPSD can 
be modelled for use in implementing IAL. 
Firstly, symptoms of dementia which Pugh et al [4] 
consider are not amenable to monitoring in smart and assisted 
living environments. These symptoms relate to depressive 
states; we would argue that the monitoring of such states is 
possible as discussed by Peng et al [11]; therefore we will 
include the precursors to depressive states in the list of 
precursors discussed in this paper. The 6 neuropsychiatric 
symptoms [4] represent classifications of precursors which are 
potentially amenable to automated sensor-based monitoring in 
IAL if suitable non-invasive sensor-based monitoring and data 
capture in a machine processable formalism can be identified 
and implemented. This is discussed in subsequent sections of 
this paper.  
A. Anomalous motor behaviour 
Anomalous motor behavior (AMB) can be viewed as 
physical movement including location-based behaviours such 
as wandering and unusual movements in space and time; 
excessive movement is addressed in the following section. 
Additionally, verbal behaviours can be viewed as motor 
behaviours. Such behaviours are amenable to monitoring using 
a range of sensor technologies including blind video 
monitoring, and non-medical grade sensors. 
B. Depression and Weight loss 
Changes in a dementia patients weight (generally weight 
loss however weight gain may be an indicative factor) is a 
significant precursor of dements behaviour driven by: failure to 
eat a good diet (often patients forget to eat a prepared meal) or 
AMB in terms of either excessive movement (a precursor of 
agitation, aggression, mania, or general restlessness) or 
alternatively too little movement which may be an indicator of 
a depressive state which has a reported frequency in a patient 
population of 80% in the BPSD scale [2][7]. 
Two potential sensing approaches are possible: (1) regular 
weighing using smart scales, and (2) sensor technologies to 
measure the levels of movement. Research conducted by James 
Levine et al [12] addresses the measurement of movement as it 
relates to obesity. Whereas in dementia the measurement 
(generally) relates to excessive motor behaviour (i.e., weight 
loss is an indicator) Levine et al targets the lack of exercise 
(resulting in weight gain).  
Notwithstanding the differing focus of the research the 
approach adopted by Levine et al may be useful in monitoring 
the motor behaviours in dementia patients (both for weigh loss 
and weight gain). In their original work the energy generated 
by sensors located in clothing was intended to measure a lack 
of exercise; the converse can be applied to dementia patients to 
measure excessive exercise.  
C. Anxiety / Irritability / Agitation 
This is perhaps the most important category of demented 
behaviour is agitation; irritability and anxiety are arguably 
related to agitation and may share many of the symptoms. Such 
symptoms and behaviours have been shown to lead to 
aggression which is an issue for patients and carers alike.  
Agitation, anxiety, and irritability may be monitored using 
blind video monitoring and non-medical grade sensors; there is 
however a potential need to include physiological 
measurements such as [13]: Galvanic Skin Response (GSR), 
Blood Volume Pressure (BVP), Heart Beat (HB), respiration, 
EEG, ECG, etc.  
IV. IMPLEMENTING INDEPENDENT ASSISTED LIVING
 Having considered the relevant metrics that relate to 
agitation and aggression in dementia and identified the 
precursors (data points in computational terms) to the onset of 
agitation and aggression we now turn to the challenge of 
implementing IAL using the precursors to trigger graduated 
interventions. From a practical perspective implementation of 
IAL essentially relies on three components:  
? The data structure used for in memory and persistent 
storage of data (contextual information), computational 
modelling
 ? Data capture using sensor networks realized using 
‘smart spaces’ with wireless networked and / or mobile 
communication technologies with interfaces to the 
software (context middleware) defining the appropriate 
data types and format 
? Context middleware to process the captured contextual 
information (sensor derived data) with visualization in 
an appropriate format.  
A. The Data Structure (Computational Modelling) 
Identifying the precursors demands the modelling of the 
domain of interest (context modelling); this has been addressed 
in [14][15] where Ontology Based Modelling (OBM) has been 
identified as the optimal approach. OBM provides a generic, 
non-hierarchical, and readily extensible structure capable of 
adaptation to suit the domain specific nature of context with 
1390
the capability to define the metadata, the context properties, 
and the literal values used in the context-matching process. 
Additionally, while the approach discussed in this paper does 
not currently use inference and reasoning (which generally 
applies subsumption and entailment) OBM facilitates this 
where required. 
Context modelling is designed to enable the mapping of 
context properties and their literal values with a comparative 
analysis of data points (such as environmental parameters), 
proximate information (social parameters), and motion (spatio-
 temporal parameters). Motion is reflected in movement and 
position (e.g., vertical or horizontal) in space and time. OBM 
implemented using Semantic Web technologies (e.g., OWL) 
[16] implemented using the Jena API [17] provides the basis 
upon which data storage with accessing and updating to be 
used in the comparative analyses. 
In considering dementia the modelling of BPSD has been 
investigations by Hurley et al [18] have resulted in the 
development of the SOAPD ontology. A number of 
implementations of systems designed to model dementia use 
the SOAPD ontology including [19] to enable the development 
of sophisticated systems that facilitates caregiving and clinical 
assessment of dementia patients. The SOAPD ontology [18] 
addresses the domain specific BPSD parameters thus enabling 
the implementation of current states (contexts) with updating 
over time in ‘real-time’ with ‘Big Data’ solutions as discussed 
in this paper.  
B. Sensors and data capture 
The nature of the data required to identify and measure the 
data points (the precursors) relate to the 6 neuropsychiatric 
symptoms identified in [4]. It is apparent from the discussion 
on precursors and symptoms that progression of dementia 
through the seven tiers is characterised by significant changes 
in behaviour. The most appropriate changes for use with 
sensing appear to be based around location, motion and sound. 
For instance, in terms of sound, it is possible to diagnose 
conditions such as Parkinson's Disease through an analysis of 
spoken words, even in the early stages (see e.g. 
www.parkinsonsvoice.org). Figure 1 shows an [android] app 
designed to monitor trembling in Parkinson’s patients, this has 
a synergy with dementia where monitoring of a patients 
dynamic and changing ‘state’ is the aim. 
Fig. 1. Measuring hand trembling using an Android smartphone. 
Sound can also be used as part of systems for emotion 
recognition as discussed in [20], this may help to inform 
diagnosis at Tier 3 and above. More significant verbal 
outbursts above Tier 3 (and even repetition at lower tiers) are 
obvious candidates for use of microphone-based sensors 
which, especially when worn on the body, need not provide 
any privacy concerns as actual voice data need not be recorded. 
It is also apparent that pitch and amplitude data, from 
microphones, can provide significant monitoring data in the 
detection of verbal aggression and screaming in tiers 4 and 
above. 
In considering motion, monitoring behaviour changes 
through video is likely to be considered highly intrusive, 
although to a reducing extent as a patient moves toward the 
higher tiers. So, in Tiers 6 and 7, where violence (to oneself 
and others) is a real risk, it is likely to be an expected form of 
monitoring (e.g. CCTV in a care home). Therefore, it is that 
perception of intrusion that is likely to, at least in part, dictate 
the sensing techniques that can be used. So, where computer 
vision is considered appropriate it also has the advantage of 
being able to provide more information than simple motion-
 related data. For instance, a significant problem in older people 
is ensuring adequate nutrition, especially where patients may 
forget to eat. In that scenario, CCTV can be used to monitor 
body-mass changes [21].  
Shadow data from cameras is likely to be more appropriate 
for lower tiers, however, where systems such as those of [22] 
can provide information on gait using the Microsoft Kinect 
sensor. For both CCTV and shadow data, it is possible to detect 
the problem of wandering (e.g. Tier 3/4 and above) and 
unattended exit, the Kinect in particular having the advantage 
of simpler three-dimensional location estimation. Similarly, 
location-contexts are likely to provide significant behaviour 
data and can be measured also through proximity switches and 
radio-module signal strength measurement (e.g. Bluetooth, 
WiFi, Zigbee, and suchlike). In some contexts night-time 
wandering can be dangerous, and so monitoring systems such 
as those discussed in [23] can help reduce risk. It has been 
suggested that temperature perception alters for dementia 
sufferers, and associated discontent can be expressed through 
problematic behaviour [24]. Also, analysis of light levels and 
spectral components within a care environment can provide 
useful clues in terms of sleep problems, see e.g., [24]. It is 
therefore possible that monitoring of dementia sufferers 
environment, comfort level and any adjustments they make to 
heating/cooling controls, could add to longitudinal data for 
diagnosis. In fact, a wide variety of links have been suggested 
between environment sensor data and medical conditions such 
as dementia, a fuller discussion being available in [25]. 
Finally, it should be noted that many of the above factors 
can be monitored through Smartphone use, as well as static and 
body-mounted monitoring systems. Smartphones are likely to 
be used by sufferers through many tiers of dementia, and 
include sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and 
microphones suitable for event detection and longitudinal data 
collection. For carers and clinicians they can also be used for 
logging of symptoms, problematic-events and emotion data 
that can enhance longitudinal analysis of sensor data (i.e. 
humans as sensors into their own, and others, states).

V. DATA PROCESSING
 The processing of the captured data into useful information 
can be viewed under two headings: (1) in ‘real-time’ data 
processing in e-health monitoring, and (2) the processing of 
data in ‘big-data’ solutions in which data is mining is applied 
to realise long-term prognoses.  
The goal of ‘real-time’ data processing in a health 
monitoring scenario is to measure a patients current state at 
time {t0} and the changed state a time {t1} (the time intervals 
between {t0} and {t1 … tn} will be defined by the clinician 
and will be patient and condition dependent). The current high 
end Smartphone offers the prospect of implementing local data 
processing with decision support thus enabling remote health 
monitoring. Health monitoring clearly involved a very large 
volume of data.  
The requirement in ‘real-time’ health monitoring is for 
health monitoring applications which can run on low-powered 
devices (such as high-end mobile phones) and can process the 
sensor derived data to reach instant decisions relating to a 
patients dynamic state at times {t0 .. tn}. Ideally, health 
monitoring systems will only communicate current patients 
state if there is an issue or problem (see the brief illustrative 
scenario later in this article). Where there is no change the 
system will not react. Clearly there is a requirement for any 
number of reasons for the patient monitoring information to be 
sent at periodic intervals for logging and possibly further 
analysis. The intervals at which such uploading of the collected 
data is made is again a clinical decision. The analysis of the 
data from multiple patients can be viewed as a big-data 
challenge.  
‘Big-Data’ (it has been observed that the term is a ‘buzz-
 word’ and has formerly been known as data mining amongst 
other similar terms) relates to a scenario in which very large 
volumes of data are gathered and processed to identify (in the 
case of health monitoring systems) trends in the data and 
potential prognoses based on the data collected and results 
obtained from multiple patients. Clearly, big-data solutions 
require massive data storage and computing power (as opposed 
to the ‘real-time’ data processing). An exemplar of a big-data 
analysis can be seen in the brief illustrative scenario later in 
this paper. 
A. Context processing 
Central in the proposed approach to data processing is the 
processing of captured data (contextual information); the 
posited approach uses a Context Processing Algorithm (CPA) 
[14] which provides a basis upon which contextual information 
can be processed while with constraint satisfaction and 
predictable decision support (an essential consideration in, for 
example, health monitoring which whilst arguably fuzzy in 
nature must result in clearly defined decisions relating to a 
patients current and changing state / prognosis.  
The CPA is predicated on the Event:Condition:Action
 (ECA) rules concept, the <condition> component employing 
the IF-THEN logic structure [14] which relates to the notion of 
<action> where the IF component evaluates the rule 
<condition> resulting in an <action>. The <action> in the 
proposed approach can be either: (1) a Boolean decision, or (2) 
the firing of another rule.  
Essentially, the context-matching process is one of reaching 
a Boolean decision as to the suitability of a specific individual 
based on context [14]. Given that a perfect match is highly 
unlikely the CM algorithm must accommodate the PM issue 
along with a number of related issues as discussed in [14]. In 
CM the probability of a perfect match is remote therefore 
Partial Matching (PM) must be accommodated. To address the 
PM issue the CPA applies the principles identified in fuzzy 
logic and fuzzy sets with a defined membership function which 
is predicated of the use of decision boundary(s) (thresholds) 
[26] as discussed in [14]. The membership function provides 
an effective basis upon which predictable decision support can 
be realized using both single and multiple thresholds to 
increase the granularity of the autonomous decision making 
process.  
Conventional logic is generally characterized using notions 
based on a clear numerical bound (the crisp case); i.e., an 
element is (or alternatively is not) defined as a member of a set 
in binary terms according to a bivalent condition expressed as 
numerical parameters {1, 0} [27]. Fuzzy set theory enables a 
continuous measure of membership of a set based on 
normalized values in the range [0.0…1.0]; these mapping 
assumptions are central to the CPA [14]. The processing of 
contextual information in context-aware systems imposes 
issues similar to those encountered in decision support under 
uncertainty, which is possibly the most important category of 
decision problem [28] and represents a fundamental issue for 
decision-support.  
In summary, the CPA provides a basis upon which 
decisions under uncertainty with high levels of predictability 
can be realised. A discussion on the CPA, rule strategies, and 
the related conditional relationships for intelligent context-
 aware systems with example implementations and a dataset 
evaluation can be found in [14]. 
VI. APPLYING INDEPENDENT ASSISTED LIVING
 We have considered the issue of an aging population and 
the prevalence of Alzheimer type conditions including 
dementia. IAL has been introduced with health monitoring and 
data processing. While health monitoring offers exciting 
potential opportunities across a range of medical conditions to 
improve QoL (for patients and also importantly carers) and 
realize efficiencies (resource utilization and financial savings) 
there are issues which must be addressed including technical 
and ethical constraints. 
A. Technical Challenges 
There are technical challenges implicit in health monitoring 
including data processing as discussed in section V and 
[3][14][30]. However we argue in [3] that while the principal 
challenges in the development of sensor technologies have 
been addressed as discussed in [3] there remains the issue of 
developing non-invasive health monitoring based on sensor 
networks. Additionally, there are ethical issues around 
monitoring using video methods as discussed in [3] where the 
problem is considered and the use of a ‘blind camera’ with data 
141132
Anonymisation is discussed. In considering sensor 
technologies the work of Peng et al as documented [11] is 
interesting in that it captures EEG data to address the cognitive 
issue of depression. Data is collected using sensors applied to 
the scalp which is ‘relatively’ non-invasive. However a truly 
non-invasive sensor technology requires at least non-intrusive 
sensor-based data capture. Currently addressing the issues 
briefly introduced represents a challenge and remains an open 
research question. 
B. Ethical Issues 
Ethical issues in medical research and clinical practice are 
not new [31][32][33] however Providing health monitoring 
always entails patient consent along with ethical issues 
identified in section VI(A). Alzheimer type conditions which 
include dementia are characterized by cognitive degeneration.  
An issue in diagnosis (particularly in the early stages of 
dementia) is differentiating between general ageing with its 
natural cognitive consequences and a patient with dementia. 
This may be simple in younger patients (dementia may be 
prevalent at 45 years of age) but a patients age diagnosis 
becomes progressively more difficult. We have discussed the 
stages of the development of dementia in section II and have 
related the stages of dementia to the 7 tier model. A discussion 
around the ethical and consent issues are beyond the scope of 
this paper however this is addressed in [31] where the 
“majority of ethical principles implicated in assessing a 
patient’s ability to consent to treatment” are reviewed.  
In considering the 7 tier model developed by Vickland and 
Brodaty as discussed in [6], in the early stages of the 
development of dementia (i.e., tiers 1-4) patients are arguably 
capable of granting informed consent however in later stages 
this will not be the case where institutionalisation in tiers 5 to 7
 is essential if only to protect the patient with advanced 
dementia from self inflicted injury. In the advanced stages of 
dementia (and probably other similar health conditions where 
cognitive issues predominate) informed consent may not be 
applicable and family members with clinicians may be required 
to arrive at ethical choices related to the fact of monitoring and 
the nature of such monitoring along with the degree of 
invasiveness as we have briefly introduced in section VI(A). 
Informed consent is a fundamental ethical concern for both 
research and clinical application in translational research [32]; 
as observed in [33] the central issues lie in how to a patient 
with dementia (or in fact any patient not of sound mind who 
may benefit from e-health monitoring) has the ability to grant 
informed consent. Clearly, where there are family members 
who are carers permission may be obtained from this source 
however many patients with dementia have no relatives able to 
grant such consents. Addressing ethical and consent issues 
represents a major challenge in both research and clinical 
practice. 
C. Applications of e-Health Monitoring 
This paper has focused on e-health monitoring for patients 
with ADRD and dementia however the technologies discussed 
are arguably transferable.  
Context and therefore e-Health monitoring are patient and 
condition specific; as such given that the correct data 
(contextual information) can be captured and processed the 
technologies introduces in this paper may be utilized across a 
range of conditions ranging from care for the elderly as we 
have discussed through patients with dementia, patients 
suffering from depression, to recuperating patients requiring 
post operative care at home (thus achieving the early release 
hospital beds with improvements in patients’ QoL). 
Thus it can be seen that the fundamental technologies 
discussed in this paper form a basis for both the monitoring of 
patients with dementia and other conditions requiring 
intelligent monitoring in decision-support systems. 
VII. CONCLUSION
 This paper has introduced the background and motivation 
for the growing concern regarding Alzheimer type conditions 
in general and dementia in particular. The BPSD has been 
discussed and the 7 tier model [6] has been presented with 
conclusions drawn on the appropriate stages of dementia which 
can be addressed using health monitoring techniques in IAL in 
a computerized system. The overall conclusions are that 
behaviors tiers 2, 3, 4, and possibly 5 may be monitored in IAL 
with the aim of enabling a demented patient to remain in a 
domestic environment for longer with benefits for the patients 
QoL, family, the healthcare system, and the wider society.  
Consideration has been given to the precursors to the 
detection of the onset of agitation and aggression in patients 
with dementia along with references to sensor technologies. In 
data intensive context-aware systems the basic component 
technologies exist are all currently available and widely 
researched. Such technologies include: mobile systems and the 
related infrastructures, sensors, smart appliances, wireless 
mesh architectures, cloud services, and data 
brokerage/processing.  
While there is a need for the development of non-invasive 
sensor technologies (as identified in this paper) the basic sensor 
and communications technologies are generally well developed 
[29]. Notwithstanding the ethical issues (arguably a research 
topic in its own right) around informed consent as introduced 
in section VI(E) the principal challenges lie in the development 
of intelligent context-aware systems software capable of 
processing the sensor derived data in context-aware decision-
 support systems capable of implementing enhanced levels of 
computational intelligence. 
Health monitoring for patients with dementia has been 
discussed and agitation and aggression identified as a major 
problem. Agitation may be viewed in terms of an emotional 
response to a range of stimuli [30]. This is addressed in [30] 
where the nature of knowledge is considered along with 
cognitive conceptual models and semiotics [34][35][36]; the 
use of these approaches to tacit and explicit knowledge 
representation including the use of valence [30][37][38] offers 
exiting potential opportunities to model agitation (stress) in 
patients with dementia to enable graduated interventions. This 
however currently represents an open research question.

While the research discussed in this paper has begun to 
resolve a number of issues relating to the processing of 
contextual information, including potentially the data that 
relates to emotional response, a number of challenges 
identified remain as open research questions. Such questions 
relate to:  
? The identification of the data (knowledge) that 
identifies emotional responses 
? The development of a [non-invasive] approach to data 
capture including approaches to video monitoring of 
patients in a range of settings using ‘blind’ camera 
technologies with effective data Anonymisation. While 
potential solutions may include the Microsoft Kinect 
technologies as discussed in [39] the actual 
implementation remains an open research question. 
? The development of a suitable Semiotic grammar and 
valence measurement system for emotion 
? Representing the knowledge (data) in a suitable data 
structure. Currently OBM represents the optimal 
solution to the storage of a context; it is however 
recognized as an effective but sub-optimal solution 
[14][15].  
For a discussion on the issues and challenges identified in 
the research with consideration of potential solutions see [14]. 
The health monitoring introduced in this paper, while 
focusing on ADRD and dementia has the potential to 
generalise to a range of conditions where IAL forms a 
desirable aim (e.g., post-operative care in a patients own 
home). The potential is very exciting and represents a 
potentially profitable direction for research with benefits for all 
stakeholders in health care.
