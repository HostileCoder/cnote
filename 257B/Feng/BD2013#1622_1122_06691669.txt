 Abstract—Analysis of information retrieved from microblog-
 ging services such as Twitter can provide valuable insight into
 public sentiment in a geographic region. This insight can be en-
 riched by visualising information in its geographic context. Two
 underlying approaches for sentiment analysis are dictionary-
 based and machine learning. The former is popular for public
 sentiment analysis, and the latter has found limited use for
 aggregating public sentiment from Twitter data. The research
 presented in this paper aims to extend the machine learning
 approach for aggregating public sentiment. To this end, a
 framework for analysing and visualising public sentiment from
 a Twitter corpus is developed. A dictionary-based approach
 and a machine learning approach are implemented within the
 framework and compared using one UK case study, namely
 the royal birth of 2013. The case study validates the feasibility
 of the framework for analysis and rapid visualisation. One
 observation is that there is good correlation between the results
 produced by the popular dictionary-based approach and the
 machine learning approach when large volumes of tweets are
 analysed. However, for rapid analysis to be possible faster
 methods need to be developed using big data techniques and
 parallel methods.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 Microblogging services such as Twitter have become an
 important platform for facilitating social interactions in mod-
 ern society. As demonstrated by recent events such as the
 Arab Spring and the Occupy Wall Street movements, these
 platforms can be used to convey powerful ideas and allow
 the general population to follow such events in real-time.
 The information posted on these platforms is a rich resource
 for obtaining insights into the sentiment of the general
 public. The retrieval and analysis of such information is
 often referred to as sentiment analysis or opinion mining.
 Traditional methods for understanding public sentiment
 are questionnaires, surveys and polls which are extremely
 limited in a number of ways. Firstly, they attract limited
 participation, and therefore, the sample is not a sufficient
 representation of the public. Secondly, they are costly to
 deploy and cannot be used on-the-fly without well laid out

 bCorresponding authors
 logistical plans. Thirdly, they cannot gather the sentiment as
 an event is unfolding. For example, using traditional methods
 the sentiment of the people participating in the Occupy Wall
 Street movement could have only been gathered after the
 event had finished.
 Currently, Twitter with more than half a billion users is
 being used as a source for retrieving information. Twitter
 provides free information through an interface in the form
 of a stream. Analysis of this information has led to a
 variety of research. Examples include prediction of elections
 [1] and the stock market [2], notification of events such
 as earthquakes [3], analysis of natural disasters [4] and
 public health information [5], estimation of public sentiment
 during elections [6] and recession [7]. This research along
 with [8] are exemplars of how correlated the information
 retrieved from Twitter and the actual events are. Hence,
 moving forward a question that arises is - ‘Why not visualise
 the information in its geographic context in real-time?’.
 The research reported in this paper is motivated towards
 analysing public sentiment related to an event affecting a
 geographic region in real-time and rapidly visualising it.
 The most common approach employed for analysing
 public sentiment is dictionary-based [1], [2] which is simple
 to implement. Public sentiment, for example, happy, sad
 or depressed, is understood by comparing tweets against
 lexicons from dictionaries. A second possible approach that
 can be employed is machine learning. This approach is not
 readily available for understanding public (or aggregate)
 sentiment [9]. However, it is used in understanding the
 sentiment of individual tweets with high accuracy [10], [11].
 The research in this paper explores how the machine learning
 approach can be extended for public sentiment analysis.
 The notable difference between the two approaches is that
 the dictionary-based approach classifies individual words in
 tweets while the machine learning approach classifies an
 entire tweet. The machine learning approach is quantitatively
 compared to the dictionary-based approach in this paper.
 The contributions of the research presented in this paper
 are: (i) the development of a framework for analysing and
 visualising public sentiment from a Twitter corpus, (ii) the
 implementation and comparison of two approaches within
 the framework for analysing public sentiment, (iii) the
 investigation of visualisation techniques for public sentiment

at multiple geographic levels, and (iv) the analysis and
 visualisation of a Twitter corpus during the birth of Prince
 George of Cambridge in 2013 as a case study.
 The remainder of this paper is organised as follows. Sec-
 tion II presents a framework for using Twitter to understand
 public sentiment. Section III employs the framework for
 understanding public sentiment in the UK at the time of
 the royal birth of 2013. Section IV concludes this paper by
 considering future work.
 II. FRAMEWORK
 The framework for analysing and visualising public sen-
 timent presented in this paper can be used to understand
 the shift of public sentiment seen in tweets and graphically
 display the sentiment across hours or days or weeks. A score
 that broadly captures public sentiment is estimated based on
 two indicators. The first indicator is a positive score to rate
 how positive the sentiment in a geographic region is. The
 second indicator is a negative score to rate negative public
 sentiment in an area. The score can also be normalised with
 lower and upper bounds as zero and one respectively. The
 score can be visualised in two geographic levels, namely
 country and county using a number of visualisation tech-
 niques.
 The framework as shown in Figure 1 consists of six
 modules, namely the Collector, the Parser, the Database, the
 Analyser, the Estimator and the Visualiser. The Collector
 module gathers the Twitter corpus. The Parser ensures that
 the obtained corpus is in a format that can be used by the
 subsequent modules in the framework. The Database module
 is a collection of tables containing Twitter data for time
 periods ranging from minutes to hours to days. The Analyser
 module mines through the tweets to analyse sentiment. The
 Estimator module estimates the scores indicating public sen-
 timent. The visualisation of the scores is facilitated through
 the Visualiser. The flow of data within the framework is also
 considered in Figure 1.
 A. Collector
 The Collector module is responsible for gathering the
 Twitter corpus from the Web. The corpus is collected in the
 JSON format, in real-time, through the Twitter Streaming
 API1. This API not only provides features to select the
 geographic region of the tweets’ origin but also provides
 options to select parameters such as keywords and language.
 B. Parser
 The Parser module is essential to trim the corpus offline.
 The collection and trimming operations are performed in two
 different stages since the Twitter Streaming API provides
 tweets at a fast rate. Parsing the corpus in real-time may
 cause the tweets that are streamed to be lost if the Parser
 cannot keep up with the data flow of the Streaming API.

 Figure 1: Framework for analysing and visualising public
 sentiment
 The output from the Parser makes the corpus readable for
 the subsequent modules in the framework.
 C. Database
 The Database module consists of three tables shown
 as T1, T2 and T3 in Figure 1. T1 is the tweet corpus
 gathered by the Collector. T1 is then parsed to produce T2,
 a trimmed readable table. The Analyser retrieves data from
 T2 for analysis and the Estimator writes T3 containing the
 public sentiment scores and associated geographic and time
 information.
 D. Analyser
 This module performs sentiment analysis to extract the
 sentiment of the tweets. Two approaches are explored in
 this paper for performing sentiment analysis, namely the
 dictionary-based and machine learning approaches. The aim
 of both the approaches is to estimate a score that captures
 the degree of ‘positive’ or ‘negative’ public sentiment of
 a geographic region in a time frame by evaluating a col-
 lection of tweets or individual tweets. The dictionary-based
 approach considers the entire collection of tweets for a given
 time period to aggregate the public sentiment across the
 collection. However, in the machine learning approach each
 tweet in the collection is assigned a sentiment score and then
 the public sentiment is aggregated from individual scores.
 The public sentiment score generated by both the approaches
 is independent of the number of tweets.

(a) Dictionary-based
 (b) Machine learning
 Figure 2: Sentiment analysis appraoches
 1) Approach 1 - Dictionary-based: Figure 2a shows the
 dictionary-based approach. The input is a data set selected
 for a time period from a specified geographic region (for
 example, country or county). The tweets of the selected
 data set are tokenised using a lexical analyser. For this the
 Stanford tokeniser [12], [13] which incorporates the Penn
 Treebank 3 (PTB) tokenisation algorithm [14] is employed.
 The tokens are then matched against a dictionary; the
 Emotional Lookup Table provided by SentiStrength [15],
 [16] is used as the dictionary. While matching, the number
 of positive sentiment and negative sentiment words in the
 entire set of tokens are counted. Then the public sentiment is
 aggregated by calculating the ratio of the positive sentiment
 to negative sentiment words.
 2) Approach 2 - Machine Learning: Figure 2b shows the
 machine learning approach. In contrast to the dictionary-
 based approach in which ‘prior linguistic knowledge’ in
 the form of dictionaries were used, the machine learning
 approach implemented in this paper considers a supervised
 training technique. The machine learning approach is pre-
 sented in three phases - firstly, the training phase, secondly,
 the testing phase, and finally, the deployment phase.
 In the training phase, the training data was collected using
 the approach presented in [17] which relies on the Distant
 Supervisor technique [18]. The training data set contains
 23,000 tweets which are labelled as positive or negative.
 This approach is in contrast to the manual approach reported
 in [19] and [20] which requires human intervention for
 labelling tweets. Unigram features are extracted from the
 training data set to train the classifier model; the Naive Bayes
 Classifier model is used.
 After training the model, in the testing phase, the approach
 is tested using the data set available from [21]. The test
 results indicate over 70% accuracy in labelling tweets and a
 similar finding is reported in [17] and [22].
 In the deployment phase, the tweets for a geographic
 region are selected from the table containing parsed tweets,
 T2. These tweets are labelled using the Classifier obtained
 from the training phase. The number of positive sentiment
 and negative sentiment tweets in the entire collection of
 tweets is counted, and public sentiment is then aggregated
 by calculating the ratio of the positive sentiment to negative
 sentiment tweets.
 E. Estimator
 The Estimator module computes a score that captures
 public sentiment. The estimation technique employed in
 the dictionary-based approach is subtly different from the
 machine learning approach and is considered in this section.
 1) Estimation in the dictionary-based approach: Con-
 sider a geographic region defined by g = 1 and 2, where
 g = 1 for a country and g = 2 for a county and time frame
 t. The public sentiment score is defined as:
 PSS(g,t) =
 count(g,t)
 (
 positive words
 )
 count(g,t)
 (
 negative words
 ) (1)
 The example illustrated in Figure 3 for a geographic
 region has one country, mycountry with two counties
 happycounty and sadcounty. The tweets for the region are
 selected from the table containing parsed tweets, T2, for a
 time frame denoted as t, starting at tstart and ending at tend.
 The selected data during the time frame is represented in the
 figure as a collection of nine tweets, five from happycounty
 and four from sadcounty. The tweets are then matched
 against a dictionary which results in the recognition of
 positive and negative words. In the figure, the positive words
 are represented in blue and the negative words in red. The
 number of positive words in the tweets is twelve (ten from
 happycounty and two from sadcounty) and the number of
 negative words is five (two from happycounty and three
 from sadcounty). Therefore, the public sentiment score for
 time t at country level for mycountry is 2.4, and the public
 sentiment score at the county level for happycounty is 5.0
 and sadcounty is 0.66. The scores for the counties can be
 48
Figure 3: Illustration of an example using dictionary-based approach
 normalised between 0 and 1, and so the normalised public
 sentiment score is 1.0 for happycounty and is 0.132 for
 sadcounty. Geographic distinctions (counties) can highlight
 the finer level of detail which can be lost when aggregated
 to higher geographic level (country).
 2) Estimation in the Machine Learning approach: Con-
 sider a geographic region defined by g = 1 and 2, where
 g = 1 for a country and g = 2 for a county and time frame
 t. The public sentiment score is defined as:
 PSS(g,t) =
 count(g,t)
 (
 positive tweets
 )
 count(g,t)
 (
 negative tweets
 ) (2)
 The example illustrated in Figure 4 for a geographic
 region has one country, mycountry with two counties
 happycounty and sadcounty. The tweets for the region are
 selected from the table containing parsed tweets, T2, for a
 time frame denoted as t, starting at tstart and ending at tend.
 The selected data during the time frame is represented in the
 figure as a collection of nine tweets, five from happycounty
 and four from sadcounty. The classifier labels the tweets
 as positive sentiment and negative sentiment. In the figure,
 the positive tweets are represented in blue and the nega-
 tive tweets in red. The number of positive tweets is five
 (four from happycounty and one from sadcounty) and the
 number of negative tweets is four (one from happycounty
 and three from sadcounty). Therefore, the public sentiment
 score for time t at country level for mycountry is 1.25,
 and the public sentiment scores at the county levels for
 happycounty and sadcounty are 4 and 0.33 respectively.
 The normalised public sentiment score between 0 and 1
 for the counties are 1.0 for happycounty and 0.0825 for
 sadcounty.
 The PSS score from both approaches are normalised to
 NPSS to be able to compare the public sentiment trend
 estimated by the approaches.

 approach
 F. Visualiser
 The Visualiser module facilitates the graphical display
 of public sentiment using three visualisation techniques.
 The first technique is choropleth visualisation of public
 sentiment on a geo-browser. In the research reported in this
 paper, Google Earth2 is employed as the geo-browser. The
 Thematic Mapping Engine (TME) [23] is used for generating
 .kml files [24] in which public sentiment data overlays
 geographic data. Choropleth is useful for presenting public
 sentiment as a gradient of colours, and in this framework the
 public sentiment of a country is presented using choropleth.
 For example, the public sentiment of England, Scotland,
 Wales and N. Ireland is represented by overlaying colours
 indicative of public sentiment in each country over the geo-
 graphic region on Google Earth. Public sentiment of counties
 are not best represented using choropleths since it would be
 visually difficult to distinguish between colours overlaid on
 2http://earth.google.co.uk/
 49
small geographic regions. While multiple dimensions of data
 can be represented using distinct gradient scales it may be
 visually challenging to distinguish between the scales.
 The second technique using tile-maps is independent of
 a geo-browser. A geographic region is represented as a
 tile and the public sentiment of the region can be visually
 distinguished not only based on the colour of the tile but also
 on its size. Google Charts API 3 is used for obtaining tile-
 maps in the framework. For example, the public sentiments
 of all the counties in the UK are represented using tiles.
 The third technique using line graph visualisation is again
 independent of a geo-browser. This technique is useful to
 understand the relative performance of the two sentiment
 analysis approaches over the dimension of time. For exam-
 ple, the public sentiment in England in the hour following
 the announcement of Prince George’s birth, estimated using
 the dictionary-based approach and the machine learning ap-
 proach, can be compared and represented using line graphs.
 III. CASE STUDY: UK ROYAL BIRTH, 2013
 The royal birth of Prince George of Cambridge on Mon-
 day, 22 July, 2013 at 16:24 BST to the Duke and Duchess of
 Cambridge is considered in the framework for analysing and
 visualising public sentiment. The first Twitter announcement
 on the day of birth that the arrival of the baby was soon
 expected was made at 07.37 BST. This attracted a lot of
 attention from Twitter users in the UK and across the world.
 Nearly 487 million users accessed tweets related to the
 birth4. This section considers the pipeline of activities to
 analyse the tweet corpus, followed by visualising the results
 obtained from the analysis, and finally, summarises the key
 observations from the case study.
 A. Analysing the tweets
 The Twitter corpus was being collected for the UK
 by the Collector module using the Twitter Streaming API
 from Sunday, July 21 2013, 00:00:01 BST until Tuesday,
 23 July, 2013, 23:59:59 BST. Nearly one million tweets
 were collected from over 150,000 Twitter users regardless
 of whether it was related to the royal birth or not. The
 location filter defining the latitude and longitude was set
 as a bounding box to NE 60.854691, 1.768960 and SW
 49.162090, -13.413930. The case study is used to compare
 the dictionary-based and machine learning approaches. The
 geographic area taken into account is the UK.
 The Parser module trimmed the corpus, and the fine level
 of geographic details, namely latitude and longitude, was
 used to map the tweets onto the county and the country
 of origin using the Global Administrative Areas (GADM)

 spatial database5 as shapefiles (.shp) [25]. The dictionary-
 based and machine learning approaches were used for sen-
 timent analysis and the aggregation of public sentiment was
 performed. The results obtained at the country level for
 July 21, July 22 and July 23 are summarised in Table I,
 where PSS is the Public Sentiment Score and NPSS is the
 normalised PSS.
 B. Visualisation
 Three techniques presented in Section II are considered
 for visualising the public sentiment in the UK. They are
 firstly, the choropleth visualisation technique is overlaid on
 Google Earth for the country level, secondly the tile-map
 visualisation technique for the county level, and thirdly, the
 line graph visualisation technique on a hourly basis at the
 country level.
 1) Visualisation on geo-browser: Figure 5 shows screen-
 shots of PSS using choropleth visualisation on Google Earth
 for July 21, July 22 and July 23 based on Table I. The highest
 volume of tweets was obtained from England, followed by
 Wales and then Scotland. The smallest number of tweets
 during the three day period was from N. Ireland. On July
 22 and July 23 the dictionary-based approach estimates
 England to have had the highest PSS compared to the other
 countries. Surprisingly, on the day after the birth, England
 dropped to the third place. On the other hand, the machine
 learning approach places England consistently in third place.
 The machine learning approach estimates Wales to have the
 highest PSS on all three days.
 Further, a correlation analysis between the PSS obtained
 from both the approaches was performed. The results ob-
 tained are summarised in Table II, where the correlation ratio
 indicates the closeness of the PSS scores estimated by the
 dictionary-based and machine learning approaches. Given
 the large volume of tweets analysed for England, there is a
 large correlation of over 80% between the results produced
 by both the approaches. The two approaches produce least
 correlated results for Wales, and the correlation ratios for
 Scotland and N. Ireland are not high. This is perhaps because
 the analysis on larger volumes of tweets can produce higher
 quality of results.
 2) Visualisation using tile-maps: Figure 6 shows the tile-
 map representation of the NPSS corresponding to all UK
 counties using the dictionary-based approach and machine
 learning approach. Each tile represents a county, and the size
 of each tile is relative to the volume of tweets that originated
 from the county. The colour of the tile is indicative of the
 normalised PSS varying from shades of red (lowest NPSS
 score) to green (highest NPSS score). The largest volume of
 tweets is from Manchester, West Yorkshire, West Midlands,
 Lancashire, Essex all in England, and the lowest volume is
 from Strabane, Larne and Moyle in N. Ireland, Rhonndda

(a) Dictionary-based approach (b) Machine learning approach
 Figure 6: Tile-map representation of Public Sentiment Score in UK counties
 in Wales, Orkney Islands and Shetland Islands. Using the
 dictionary-based approach the public sentiment score is
 highest for the Greater London area that includes London,
 Sutton, Westiminster, Kensington and Chelsea, Tower Ham-
 lets and Islington, and is the lowest for Shetland Islands,
 Armagh in N. Ireland and Rhondda in Wales. There is a
 predominance of the red shade and this is largely because
 there are relatively few high PSS values. Therefore, when
 the lower PSS values are normalised using the approach
 presented in Section II they diminish greatly.
 The trends seen in the dictionary-based approach are
 quite comparable to the trends seen in the machine learning
 approach. Using the machine learning approach Strabane,
 Shetland Islands and Rhondda have very high PSS scores
 which are notable exceptions. This is so because a very
 small number of tweets are analysed for these counties.
 Surprisingly, Rhondda falls under the exception though there
 is a reasonably large volume of tweets. Similar to the
 dictionary-based approach, Larne has a low NPSS in the
 machine learning approach. The regions that had a high
 NPSS score in the dictionary-based approach are also found
 to have a high NPSS score using machine learning.
 3) Visualisation using line graphs: Figure 7 shows the
 visualisation of the trend of public sentiment in England,
 Wales, N. Ireland and Scotland from 21 July 2013 to 23
 July 2013. The tweet corpus for Scotland after 10:00 BST
 was not obtained on 22 July 2013. The number of tweets
 used to analyse the sentiment for England was nearly one
 million, for Wales was over 69,000, for N. Ireland was over
 24,000, and for Scotland was nearly 65,000. In general,
 Country No. of Tweets Correlation Ratio
 England 989,413 0.8192
 Scotland 64,980 0.6110
 Wales 69,459 0.3146
 N. Ireland 24,117 0.5485
 Table II: Correlation ratio between the dictionary-based and
 the machine learning approaches
 both the dictionary-based and machine learning approaches
 produce the same trend though several exceptions can be
 noted; in the case of England, there seems to be fewer
 exceptions and is likely to be because a large number of
 tweets are analysed. For Wales the exceptions are seen for
 two time periods, firstly, between 00:00 and 07:00, and
 secondly, between 17:00 to 20:00. Though the dictionary-
 based approach estimates an increasing positive trend in the
 sentiment score after the birth of the Prince, the machine
 learning approach fails to capture this. In the case of N.
 Ireland there is a close similarity in the trend between 22
 July 12:00 BST and 23 July 12:00 BST when there was a
 high volume of tweets regarding the birth. Similarity in the
 increasing and decreasing trends of PSS across the days are
 also noted for Scotland.
 C. Discussion
 In the case of England, during the announcement of the
 birth on July 22 and for a few hours later the PSS has
 a steady trend at an average of 0.7. This indicates that
 the tweets posted during this time have nearly 30% more
 negative sentiments than positive sentiments. However, after

 Figure 7: Variation of public sentiment in the UK from 21-
 23 July 2013
 20:00 BST on July 22 there is a quick spike in the PSS
 lasting a couple of hours which is again noted on July 21
 and July 23. This is perhaps due to the increase in the
 volume of tweets posted during these hours. Interestingly,
 for Wales and N. Ireland an increasing trend with higher
 PSS scores are noted. For example, using the dictionary-
 based approach in Wales a steady rise of the PSS from less
 than 0.5 to over 1.0 is noted during and after the birth. Since
 this trend is not observed the previous day or the day after
 the birth it can be inferred that the people of Wales were
 more positive during the time of the birth than the people
 in England. A progressively steady decrease is noted in the
 public sentiment of Scotland, though the PSS during and
 after the time of the birth is higher than that of England.
 In summary, inspite of the fact that there is strong
 correlation between the two approaches for England, the
 dictionary approach places England in the first place for
 July 21 and July 22 and then in the third place for July 23,
 and the machine learning approach places England in the
 third place in the UK from 21-23 July for positive public
 sentiment. Therefore, ‘Does England react quickly to events
 unlike other member countries?’ This is a pointer to further
 investigation and is beyond the scope of this paper.
 To conclude, the case study indicates that the public
 sentiment scores estimated by the machine learning approach
 is highly correlated to the dictionary-based approach when
 large volumes of tweets are analysed for a time period.
 Nonetheless, several exceptions are noted and will require
 a closer investigation. While the current implementation of
 the machine learning approach is slow it is possible to
 be employed for offline estimation, particularly when an
 analysis of a past event is being performed. Case studies to
 validate the use of the framework for analysing past events
 will be reported elsewhere.
 IV. CONCLUSIONS
 This paper presented a framework for the analysis and
 visualisation of public sentiment. The framework comprises
 modules to collect, parse, analyse, estimate and visualise the
 estimated public sentiment. A Public Sentiment Score (PSS)
 and a normalised PSS based on positive and negative indices
 that broadly capture public sentiment of geographic regions
 was used in this research. The scores were graphically
 visualised on a geo-browser, as tile-maps and as time graphs.
 The two underlying approaches employed in the framework
 are dictionary-based and machine learning. While the former
 approach is commonly employed the latter is not used for
 aggregating public sentiment. In this framework we explored
 how the machine learning approach can be used like the
 dictionary-based approach for analysing public sentiment.
 One case study, namely the Royal Birth of 2013 in the
 UK, was considered to compare the public sentiment scores
 estimated by the two approaches. Preliminary efforts indi-
 cate that there is a reasonable correlation between scores
 produced by the two approaches and indicate the feasibil-
 ity of the machine learning approach for analysing public
 sentiment.
 A key observation from the case study is that the prob-
 lem of managing and visualising tweets for events that
 span across days cannot be maintained and analysed using
 traditional databases and data management techniques. For
 example, the tweet corpus for a two day period contained
 nearly one million tweets resulting in approximately five
 gigabytes of data. Such large amounts of data will require
 ‘big data’ techniques, such as the use of Hadoop to address
 the data processing challenge. Faster methods will need to
 be developed to facilitate real-time analysis and visualisation
 of public sentiment. The machine learning approach is a
 slow method compared to the dictionary-based approach and
 in this research could not be employed for real-time visu-
 alisation as an event was unfolding. While the framework
 is capable of rapidly ingesting data, it cannot process data
 rapidly. Again fast and parallel methods for processing will
 need to be explored.
 Looking forward, this research aims to progress in the
 direction of employing big data techniques and parallel
 methods to develop a framework for real-time analysis
 and visualisation of public sentiment. A combination of
 53
classifiers for the machine learning approach will be in-
 vestigated to verify whether the results can be improved.
 Methods will be pursued to analyse tweets for capturing a
 broader spectrum of sentiments. The cartogram visualisation
 technique to consider the number of tweets in the context
 of population of counties will be made use of. Efforts will
 also be made towards developing a distributed framework
 available for public use.
