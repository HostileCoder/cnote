Abstract— The Cyber-Infrastructure for Billions of Electronic 
Records (CI-BER) project is a collaborative big data management 
project based on the integration of heterogeneous datasets and 
multi-source historical and digital collections, including a place-
 based citizen-led crowdsourcing case study of the Southside 
neighborhood in Asheville, North Carolina. The project is funded 
by the National Science Foundation and the National Archives and 
Records Administration (NARA) agencies.  A test-bed collection 
containing nearly 100 million files and 50TB of data was 
developed, with content representing electronic Federal 
Government records from 150 federal agencies.  The CI-BER 
project advances the state of the art in generalizable and extensible 
ultra-highly scalable data management architectures, potentially 
enabling robust technical preservation of, and access to, electronic 
records and digital data in the context of emerging national scale 
cyber-environments. A first-generation open source collaborative 
mapping environment prototype is currently being developed to 
support novel “citizen-led crowdsourcing” possibilities for archival 
material.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
The Cyber-Infrastructure for Billions of Electronic 
Records (CI-BER) project is a collaborative big data 
management project based on the integration of 
heterogeneous datasets and multi-source historical and 
digital collections, including a place-based citizen-led 
crowdsourcing case study of the Southside neighborhood in 
Asheville, North Carolina. The project is funded by the 
National Science Foundation and the National Archives and 
Records Administration (NARA) agencies.  A test-bed 
collection containing nearly 100 million files and 50TB of 
data was developed, with content representing electronic 
Federal Government records from 150 federal 
agencies.  The CI-BER project advances the state of the art 
in generalizable and extensible ultra-highly scalable data 
management architectures, potentially enabling robust 
technical preservation of, and access to, electronic records 
and digital data in the context of emerging national scale 
cyber-environments. A first-generation open source 
collaborative mapping environment prototype is currently 
being developed to support novel “citizen-led 
crowdsourcing” possibilities for archival material. 
Concurrent with the development of this prototype was the 
co-creation of a citizen-led crowdsourcing protocol to solicit 
design input from community members, a process that 
represents a viable technique to deal with “big data” 
processing and management.  The connection between these 
two prototypes lies in the ability to expose relevant CI-BER 
datasets (1930 Census, 1937 redlining data, 1940 Census, 
etc.) to the “crowds” and allow them to tag and augment this 
content with additional annotations and knowledge.

II. CITIZEN-LED CROWDSOURCING 
Crowdsourcing is “the process of leveraging public 
participation in or contributions to projects and activities” 
[1] and is carried out in different ways depending on the 
community involved, the content to be crowdsourced, and 
the technology available. What sets this project apart from a 
straightforward digitization or visualization project is its 
deployment of citizen-led crowdsourcing, in which the 
community assumes an essential role in the design and 
implementation process. The CI-BER study followed a four-
 phase crowdsourcing process designed with and for the 
Southside Asheville community: 1. crowdsourcing 
framework, 2. community history, 3. remapping process, 
and 4. citizen-led crowdsourcing process. 
 
A. Crowdsourcing Framework 
Drawing on what citizens know and want to know is 
instrumental to CI-BER’s implementation of crowdsourcing. 
The involvement of Asheville’s Southside community in co-
 creating and designing the process was of paramount 
importance to its success. Dunn and Hedges [1] describe 
three types of crowdsourcing approaches: contributory, 
collaborative, and co-created. CI-BER proposed a process of 
co-creation, in which the community was actively involved 
in most or all steps of crowdsourcing, which framed their 
engagement as citizen-led crowdsourcing. Energetic and 
vital participation in an earlier North Carolina Humanities 
Council (NCHC) project, Twilight of a Neighborhood, [2] 
indicated that the community would willingly participate in 
a citizen-led crowdsourcing process.  
CI-BER’s employment of “citizen-led crowdsourcing” 
is inspired by the Obama administration’s Open 
Government Initiative [3], which encourages public 
participation and collaboration. It is a derivative of the term 
citizen sourcing, defined as the “government adoption of 
crowdsourcing techniques for the purposes of (1) enlisting 
citizens in the design and execution of government services 
and (2) tapping into the citizenry’s collective intelligence.” 
[4] Vivek Kundra, Chief Information Officer of the United 
States from March 2009 to August 2011 under President 
Obama, described citizen sourcing as a way of “tapping into 
the ingenuity of the American people to solve those 
problems that are too big for government to solve on its 
own.” [5]. Citizen sourcing is derived from the term 
crowdsourcing and emphasizes the type of civic engagement 
typically enabled through Web 2.0 participatory 
technologies, over a more impersonal crowd-based 
distributed problem-solving and production model. 
Hilgers and Ihl [6] suggest that “external collaboration 
and innovation between citizens and public administrations 
can offer new ways of citizen integration and participation, 
enhancing public value creation and even the political 
decision-making process.”  This type of collaboration 
extends to what the Archivist of the United States, David 
Ferriero, called “citizen archivists”[7] in reference to citizen 
scientists, as a means to increase public engagement in the 
archives given the National Archives and Records 
Administration’s over-abundance of paper records and the 
need to digitize and transcribe them. A participatory archive 
is “an organization, site or collection in which people other 
than archives professionals contribute “knowledge or 
resources, resulting in increased understanding about 
archival materials, usually in an online environment.”[8] 
This definition relates to the notion of “citizen-led 
sourcing” implemented in the CI-BER project, putting 
civically engaged community members at the forefront so 
that the focus is on their collective engagement with the 
archive.

B. Community History 
The University of North Carolina-Asheville (UNC-A) 
Ramsey Library’s Special Collections & University 
Archives acquired the Housing Authority of the City of 
Asheville records in July of 2007. The nearly intact and 
complete collection of urban renewal documents [9] 
includes approximately 130 linear feet and 129 cartons that 
document a number of “significant redevelopment projects 
undertaken from the early 1960s to the mid-1980s.” CI-BER 
focuses on Asheville’s Southside area, which at over 400 
acres was the largest urban renewal area in the southeastern 
United States. In 1966, the Southside community 
22
represented about 4,000 people, 98% of whom were African 
American, living in nearly 1,300 households, and 
comprising 7% of Asheville’s population. In 2008, the 
North Carolina Humanities Council (NCHC) sponsored a 
project that documented the community’s life prior to urban 
renewal [2]. 
Urban renewal as a federal government program was a 
24-year (1949-1973) initiative started under the Housing 
Act of 1949, and modified under the Housing Act of 1954. 
It used the 1930’s Home Owners’ Loan Corporation 
(HOLC) redlining terminology of “blight” and “slums” to 
launch an ambitious redevelopment and eminent domain 
process that led to the bulldozing of some 2,500 
neighborhoods in 993 American cities. It is estimated that 
one million people were dispossessed in the process. [10] 
C. Remapping Process 
Maps are a natural visualization method for presenting 
the changes across neighborhoods. However, GIS 
applications focus primarily on structured data, analytics, 
and thematic mapping, and require thorough grounding in 
geographic principles to be used effectively.  A platform 
that supports community mapping must be able to handle 
structured data and unstructured data equally, and must 
allow for collaborative editing of content by non GIS-
 experts.  These requirements are driven by the project itself 
and the nature of the data collection. 
The goal of CI-BER was to recreate an entire collection 
in the very first iteration, to capture key elements (owner, 
renter, parcel number, street address) per scanned 
documents (initial appraisal sheet, and house photo) from 
the “Housing Authority of the City of Asheville Records” at 
UNC-A [11] and rapidly remap the entire Southside 
neighborhood. This information was combined with 
fragments of maps found in the collection to create a digital 
spatial canvas of the entire neighborhood in 1965 prior to 
urban renewal. Each digitized parcel is clickable and linked 
to its key elements. Being able to reproduce this process 
online and identify and tag collection items is a key output 
of the citizen-led sourcing of the archive. Through iterative 
and incremental passes over the files, the CI-BER team 
gradually digitized strategic content, transcribed it through 
citizen-led crowdsourcing, visualized and mapped the 
content, enhanced the collection, and developed a working 
content model, and added functionality to the software user 
interface being built. 
The software supporting this process is Big Board, [12] 
part of RENCI’s Geoanalytics [13] geospatial 
cyberinfrastructure. Big Board is a web-based collaborative 
mapping interface that enables its users to juxtapose 
traditional GIS data with unstructured data via a set of 
drawing tools and an underlying content management 
system (CMS). Originally envisioned as a decision support 
tool for emergency managers [14] who need more flexibility 
and timeliness than traditional GIS affords, Big Board was 
repurposed to support the cooperative work of digital 
humanities scholars and Asheville community members 
[15]. In the Big Board, users collaborate in a virtual data 
room that allows GIS maps to be layered onto web-maps 
and users are able to draw on and edit content, seeing 
changes in real time. 
CI-BER collaborators began by pulling in an historical 
1960s map of the Asheville area, georeferencing it in a GIS 
system, and adding it to a Big Board room.  Modern layers 
from the Asheville city GIS system such as street centerlines, 
tax parcels, and addresses were then added to support and 
provide context to the historical content. From this basis, 
collaborators drew individual polygons using the Big 
Board’s drawing tools that represent tax parcels from the 
historical map. 
Big Board software associates an editable web page 
from the CMS with each polygon.  Web pages were edited 
in the Big Board’s WSIWYG editor adding the 
aforementioned key elements: owner, renter, parcel number, 
street address and collaborators can append scanned pages, 
photographs, audio clippings, or additional descriptive text 
to each page.  In the Big Board map interface, the polygons 
are now clickable links on the map that take a user to the 
created content (and allow editing if the user has sufficient 
permissions). 
This process allows incremental, “schema-less” editing 
of content by the CI-BER collaborative team whereas 
traditional GIS setups would enforce a schema to start with 
and force collaborators to email documents back and forth 
and work from a “master copy,” changing the process and 
leaving it more error-prone.   
D. Citizen-led Crowdsourcing 
Critical to citizen-led crowdsourcing is the 
collaboration of a key community member who contributed 
to the design of Big Board on behalf of the Southside 
residents. The key member of the CI-BER project team is 
the chair of the Southside Community Advisory Board in 
Asheville; as a resident of the Southside neighborhood 
during the time of urban renewal and a leader still residing 
in the community today, her feedback provided an 
invaluable connection to the community and its history. 
Building and maintaining trust with the community cannot 
be understated in terms of its significance to the credibility 
and success of a project like CI-BER. Having a leader from 
the Southside Community Advisory Board represent the 
project at community events, discuss it locally via word of 
mouth, give interviews to local news [16], and introduce CI-
 BER at a “Remapping Community” information session on 
August 3rd, 2013 ensures that the project is citizen-led.   
23
“Remapping Community” was the CI-BER project’s 
initial introduction to the community and included 
information about the process of urban renewal in Asheville, 
an introduction of the CI-BER team to the community and a 
demonstration of Big Board’s capabilities and possibilities 
for preserving and displaying the neighborhood’s African 
American history through varied data streams (archival data, 
text, image, audio, and video).  The information session 
concluded with the Southside neighborhood’s civically 
engaged community members contributing to the design and 
input for execution of the next steps of data collection to be 
appended to Big Board, including the collection of 
photographs, written documents and oral histories.  Central 
to this process is the importance of understating what 
citizens’ motivations are and how to sustain their interest.  
We hope this project will also lead to insights in this area. 
III. CONCLUSION 
 
Nationwide, thousands of cities followed the same 
urban renewal development patterns that the Southside 
neighborhood in Asheville, North Carolina experienced, and 
this case study naturally leads to scaling at a very large 
national level. By focusing on the Southside neighborhood 
in Asheville, North Carolina, CI-BER demonstrates the 
potential for automation and integration of temporal and 
spatial datasets involving census, economic, historic, 
planning, insurance, scientific, and financial content, with 
an eye on scalability and the goal of making a national 
impact on future research.
