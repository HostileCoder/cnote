Abstract—Identity awareness of research data has been 
introduced as a requirement for open research, transparency 
and reusability of research data in the context of eScience. 
This requirement includes the capability of linking research 
data to researchers, research projects and publications, and 
identifying the license for the data. This connectivity between 
research data and other elements in research ecosystems is 
required in order to make the data available and reusable 
beyond the initial research. In this paper, we examine these 
capabilities in the domains of veillance and social computing. 
The dataset cases presented in this paper articulate the 
challenges that researchers face as they seek to expose data 
created as a result of research activities.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Researchers working in the domains of Veillance and 
social computing are faced with the unenviable challenge of 
data management often beset with ambiguity of ownership 
and licensing conditions. The dataset cases presented in this 
paper exemplify the diversity of data types, locations, 
licensing conditions and ownership contention that often 
govern re-use of data. 
The term Veillance [1] is used here to describe the 
domain within which surveillance [2], sousveillance [3], 
dataveillance [4] and the emergent concept of Uberveillance 
[5] are included. Social computing [6] is used in the context 
of this paper to describe the applied use of technologies that 
share a high degree of community formation and user level 
content creation. The new data-driven scientific era is highly 
focused on investigating research questions that requires 
datasets beyond a simple spreadsheet.  
As researchers conduct research activities to position 
data as a valid, citable research output the eScience concept 
of identity awareness for research data [7] may inform 
researchers working in these domains to address key 
capabilities for data reuse that include:  
• Resolving an identifier for data or contributors to 
the original entity 
• Connecting identifiers for the same object or 
contributor across different services 
• Identifying all the publications related to a 
particular dataset and vice versa 
• Identifying all datasets from a contributor and vice 
versa 
• Identifying the license for a dataset 
• Parsing an entire identity chain, connecting data, 
people and publications as an interoperable and 
seamless service.  
Jim Grey describes today’s science as the fourth 
paradigm [8] whereas a thousand years ago science was 
emperical, in the last few hundred years theoretical, over the 
last few decades computational and today data exploration 
giving birth to the term ‘eScience’ where exploiting data is 
the key to scientific discovery. In recent years cross-
 disciplinary research projects have emerged which require 
collaboration of researchers from differing backgrounds, 
from humanities to physics or engineering, using datasets 
often scattered amongst multiple institutions and across 
continents. 
In October 2010, the ‘Final report of the High Level 
Expert Group on Scientific Data: A submission to the 
European Commission’ entitled ‘Riding the Wave’ aimed to 
answer one question: "How can Europe gain from the rising 
tide of scientific data?" [9]. The report describes the rising 
51978-1-4799-0929-2/13/$31.00 c©2013 IEEE
significance of scientific data as an opportunity for 
governments and research institutions to provide researchers 
with a proper research e-infrastructure in order for 
researchers to collaborate on the same dataset from different 
domains, sharing a dataset across the globe.  
Such collaborations can provide insights into some of the 
most difficult questions of our time, such as social and 
economic impact of climate change. The Riding The Wave 
report expresses the vision of a scientific e-infrastructure 
that supports seamless access, use, re-use, and trust of data. 
In a sense, the physical and technical infrastructure becomes 
invisible and data themselves become the infrastructure – a 
valuable asset, with which science, technology, the economy 
and society can advance.  Similar research infrastructure has 
been invisaged in Australia as part of the $542m 
government investment in the National Collaborative 
Research Infrastructure Strategy1 (NCRIS).  
These investments have lead to the development of a 
number of research data capture, storage and dissemination 
infrastructure projects in Australia. It is forseeable that the 
systematic approach to curation and dissemination of 
research data will soon be a requirement for all publicly 
funded research projects. In this paper we extend the 
concept of identity awareness to include the access right 
(licence) for the research data and how this concept can be 
used to examine potential re-usability of research data in the 
domains of Veillance and social computing.  
Particularly, we focus on the nature of the data in social 
computing and the impact of domain specific limitations that 
prevent data re-use, access to data, the issues posed by the 
heterogeneity of data, privacy and the importance of 
infrastructure to support open access. The scope of limited 
studies in this paper draws upon developments in the open 
knowledge, open access agenda, open data strategy, digital 
open government, open social data, transnational research 
data alliances and data publishing [10]. 
 
II. IDENTITY AWARENESS OF RESEARCH DATA 
In this section we outline the key elements that are 
considered critical to a research data ecosystem and then 
proceed to define the concept of identity awareness of 
research data.  
The following key elements are considered critical to a 
research data ecosystem: 
• Dataset - research data that has been used for 
academic publication2 
• Researcher - The person or research group/s who 
has contributed to collecting or creating the data or 
used this data as part of an academic publication 
• Publication - An academic document that reports 
on a research activity that has used the dataset as an 
input or an output

  A research data repository may hold more than one dataset while a 
dataset is composed of multiple data elements about physical or digital 
objects 
• Grant - The research project or research program 
that has funded or supported creating or collecting 
the research data 
• Licence - The access rights to the dataset 
In addition, differing contexts and contributing factors, 
which govern whether data can be accessed or considered 
for re-use are also considered.  
There are four key components to identity awareness [11] in 
the context of research data: 
1. Identifying the researcher (recipients) who have 
contributed to or who have used a dataset enabling 
researchers to receive credit for their effort upon curation, 
encouraging data re-use and fostering collaboration by 
connecting collaborators to the researcher  
2. Identifying all publications (dissemination) related to 
a particular dataset derived by data citation, which in turn 
enables reproducing the scientific results and provides 
credibility to research data and scientific discoveries 
3. Identifying the project (activity) that funded the 
dataset which facilitates the reuse of data by providing 
information about the research activity and demonstrates the 
reuse of data as the return of investment for publically 
funded projects 
4. Identifying the licence (condition) access rights for the 
dataset that is vital for enabling the reuse of research data.

representation of the vital components with which the identity awareness 
of research data can be determined. 
 
III. DATASET CASES – RE-USE CHALLENGES   
Using the afore mentioned four key components with 
which identity awareness of research can be determined, a 
methodological approach was devised to analyse a number 
of datasets from transdisciplinary research areas including 
astronomy, social sciences, engineering and education. 
It is important to note that this methodological approach, 
where considering data as the central catalyst with which to 
consider re-use potential, identified possible configurations 
or conditions of access to data that contribute to re-use 
challenges including:

1) The MACHO Project 
 
The MACHO Project 3  was a collaborative project 
between scientists from the Australian Mt. Stromlo and 
Siding Springs Observatory, which is a part of the 
Australian National University (ANU) in Canberra, Centre 
for Particle Astrophysics at the Santa Barbara, San Diego, 
the Berkley campuses of the University of California and the 
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory.

The project was formed to test the hypothesis that 
objects such as brown dwarfs or planets make up the

majority of the dark matter that exists in the halo of our own 
galaxy. These MACHOs (Massive Compact Halo Objects) 
can be detected by observing the effect of their gravity on 
the light from extra-galactic stars.   
In this search for Massive Compact Halo Objects 
(MACHOs), known dense star fields in neighbouring 
galaxies were repeatably photographed, when visible, for a 
period of over 10 years. Each observation consisted of 
simultaneously taking images, eight through a red filter and 
eight through a blue filter. Both red and blue images for a 
given observation cover the exact same region of sky at the 
exact same point in time. The dataset consists of a catalogue 
of 76 million stars, several hundred observations of each on 
average. The total catalogue data (stars plus lightcurves) is 
about 12TB. 
The dataset creation preceds digital object identifiers 
(DOI) however separate DOIs are currently being assigned 
to the overall images dataset, the star catalog and the 
photometry catalog. The project website contains an 
“Acknowledgement to use when referencing MACHO 
project data” used to determine via Google Scholar when the 
dataset has been cited. 
In summary, The MACHO Project is an eScience big 
data dataset, an example that meets all four of the criteria 
considered critical for identity awareness of research data. 
Data is available via an open public domain license, the 
process of DOI minting has begun on this project to ensure 
greater tracking of exposure and re-use of the data and the 
project continues to be used by numerous researchers and 
cited in research papers, conference proceedings and 
eResearch projects. 
 
2) Glogger.mobi Project 
 
This data repository evolved from Mann's "Wearable 
Wireless Webcam” (1994) that was the first cyberlog or 
glogging service freely made available for public use. 
 This digital repository provides users of lifelogging and 
other technologies to submit, store and share their data 
online.  The popularity of this open Internet accessible 
website grew until substantially and on February 22, 1995 
Mann's Wearable Wireless Webcam became "Cool Site of 
the Day" [12] Joi Ito's chronology of "moblogging" (mobile 
logging) credits Mann as the inventor (originator) of the 
moblogging [13] Wearable Wireless Webcam, itself 
deriving from Mann's earlier CyborgLog4which is a first-
 person recording of various physiological and environmental 
sensors in an activity, in which the person doing the 
recording is a participant in the activity. [14]

Glogger.mobi was created by Professor Steve Mann's 
team at University of Toronto and has 246,282 users 5 and 
many terabytes of data in the form of images, audio, video, 
autosensory (self-sensing), physiological, sousveillance, as 
well as related metadata. 
CyborGlogging pre-dates blogging (web logging), and 
differs from blogging/logging in that the cyborglog is 
created without conscious thought or effort by the person 
doing it [15]. EXIF and associated geospatial metadata is 
exposed with each data element, content syndication is 
available using RSS and downloads of data are offered in 
FLV, MPEG4 and the original high definition format.  
In summary, Glogger.mobi Project meets 4 of the 4 
criteria considered critical for identity awareness of research 
data, however, due to its iterative and dynamic state 
Glogger.mobi remains a contentious case as it no formal 
data repository status despite the fact that it is cited in 
numerous research journals, conference proceedings and e-
 publishing articles. 
 
3) Digital Outback Project 
 
The former Australian Flexible Learning Framework, 
[16] an Australian federal government initiative awarded 
funding to successfull applicants from the private, 
government and industry based vocational training sector to  
embed the use of e-learning and emergent technologies in an 
education and training context. 
Under the auspice of ‘E-learning for Target Groups’ this 
project engaged Australian Aboriginal learners throughout 
rural and remote communities in Western Australia.

Supported by the telco Telstra Australia, a number of 
mobile technologies including a 02 XDA PDA and camera 
enabled Nokia 6000 series mobile phones were taken into 
the West Australian remote communities of Parnngurr, 
Punmu and Jigalong communities for use in educational and 
community activities. 
This project sought to engage learners in online digital 
story telling activities that brought them into contact with 
international communities. This project successfully 
demonstrated the use, for educational purposes, of mobile 
blogging, or moblogging of digital images to remote servers 
using email GPRS. Due to cultural sensitivities around 
visual and audio digital data capture, the ownership of data 
in this cultural context was deemed as shared amongst the 
Aboriginal community. Strict permissions to publish were 
negotiated in the form of image watermarking for select 
digital artefacts. 
The data remains accessible, however, data provenance 
and intellectual property rights are not clearly defined due to 
differing cultural understandings of the Parnngurr 
community, the Australian Federal Government and various 
researchers involved in the research activity that generated 
the data.  
In summary, the Digital Outback Project meets 2 of the 4 
criteria considered critical for identity awareness of research 
data. A mixed license type state (due to multiple and 
differing investments from key stakeholders) affects data re-
 use. Despite the fact that the project has been cited in 
numerous research papers, conference proceedings and 
Australian Federal government reports the dataset has no 
formal citation or recognized acknowledgement statement. 
 
4) The Biomass Heat Transfer Project 
 
The Biomass Heat Transfer Project facilitated by 
researcher Leigh Blackall is openly accessible via the 
Internet to research data that is dynamically authored and 
made available for re-use. 
Blackall cites the emergent concept of Networked 
Learning [17] as the premise by which a body of digital 
artefacts including images, video, audio, geolocation and 
related metadata is created, facilitated by the Internet. The 
‘Biodynamic Heat Transfer’ project is an ongoing data 
collection that involves multiple researchers (contributors) 
dynamically updating the collection including text based 
conversational contributions that further the cause of open 
education resources (OER) [18].

The focus of this project according to Blackall is to 
demonstrate an emergent learning and accreditation process, 
one in which multiple contributors dynamically update a 
multiple format dataset distributed across multiple digital 
platforms, connected via hyperlinking and other syndication 
services such as RSS and XML.  
According to the researcher this dataset challenges 
traditional scholarly data publication as to the near future: 
• Trajectory of dynamic data publication; 
• Convivial nature of collaborative peer review; 
• Emergent case for hybrid data provenance; 
• Informal and peer oriented academic accreditation; 
• Shift from expert centred to participatory, multi-
 author data creation and data reuse 
In summary, the Biomass Heat Transfer Project meets 2 
of the 4 criteria considered critical for identity awareness of 
research data. The data is available via a number of open 
web services under a range of license conditions however, 
due to its iterative and dynamic state this dataset remains a 
contentious case with limited citations existing in formal 
research papers, journals, conference proceedings or 
associated literature. Blackall considers the data as 
published, although this premise is only partially 
acknowledged in established research communities. 
 
5) TalkingVTE Project 
 
The TalkingVTE Project dataset contains the archived 
podcast audio recordings made at annual Australian Flexible 
Learning Framework (AFLF) eLearning showcase events 
from 2006 through to 2011. 
These audio recordings provide a rich cross section of 
innovation in Australian e-learning and mobile learning 
conducted throughout the vocational educational and 
training sector. Most of the recordings were conducted in 
studio sessions, conference recordings or vox-pop 
interviews with educational leaders working in the areas of 
workforce development, workplace training, innovation and 
wearable computing.

audio collection has survived the numerous funding 
iterations of the Australian Flexible Learning Framework by 
virtue of the efforts of the primary researcher Stephan 
Ridgway who continues to maintain the collection under a 
personal account profile.  
In summary, the TalkingVTE Project meets 2 of the 4 
criteria considered critical for identity awareness of research 
data. Whilst this dataset has limited research publication 
status the media contents, according to the researcher, are 
regularly accessed for download. Due to the archived state 
of the data, no further consideration has been made for DOI 
minting or further data publication, subsequently the dataset 
case will have no formal citation or recognized 
acknowledgement statement.  
 
IV. ADVANTAGES OF DATA PUBLICATION 
According to Pily and Fukasuka [19], peer-review and 
subsequent publishing of data has benefits for more than just 
the data scientists who create the datasets. As the previous 
datasets evidence, publishing data also benefits the funding 
bodies that pay for the data to be collected as well as the 
wider academic community. 
It is also evident that twenty-first century research must 
make data dissemination a regular part of scholarly work 
flows. Better data dissemination can promote analytic rigor 
and transparency; reduce inefficiencies and duplication of 
effort, and open new research opportunities for larger scale 
and multidisciplinary inquiry. This need pertains to many 
areas of the humanities, social sciences and natural sciences. 
[20]  
 
In the last two years data journals have evolved in a 
number of forms that differ markedly from database portals, 
dataset services or publications that only describe where a 
dataset may be accessed. [21] The primary purpose of data 
journals is to expose datasets and make them accessible for 
other researchers to reuse. Data journals also facilitate 
researcher activity that ties safe and trustworthy repositories 
for the preservation of underlying research data to the 
publication. For findability, citability and re-use, it is of 
ultimate importance that researcher validated data are well 
linked with publications to ensure their inclusion in the 
record of science. [22] 
2013 IEEE International Symposium on Technology and Society (ISTAS) 55
In the research domain of Veillance and that of social 
computing the challenge is not only how to bring about 
ientity awareness of research data, but also how to support 
initiatives that guarantee true personal information asset 
management which in turn ensures that widespread 
permissions and access to the data can be managed while 
protecting individual privacy and security. [23] 
 
V.  THE IMPORTANCE OF DATA IN RESEARCH 
Traditionally researchers have been at the mercy of the 
‘publish or perish’ yardstick. Catch crys of ‘show me the 
data’ or ‘data as gold’ suggest a growing awareness of the 
priority and importance of data in the research community 
and the need for publishers to support data publication.  
Datasets have several important qualities that differ from 
manuscripts as datasets can often be quite large (scale) and 
full of complex interrelationships between various tables 
and multimedia files (image, videos, GIS etc.) [20] There is 
multitude of proprietary and open format data softwares 
required to access, transfer, resolve or visualise such data.  
Paradoxically, governments who institute policy to 
ensure quality assurance of data management and 
subsequent publication are now challenged also to take and 
apply the lead from galleries, libraries, archives museums 
and research organisations to manage rich media data 
content across whole of government. [24] The rapid shift to 
smart infrastructures that depend on Internet connectivity 
has profoundly altered the data landscape for researchers 
and access to these repositories has subsequently become 
easier to handle big data. As this paper attests, data 
repositiories, data publishing, advanced citation and curation 
techniques facilitate re-use of data in turn lowering access 
barriers and avoiding hours of wasted research activity. 
With a push for greater financial scrutiny and 
accountability, researchers who would have once operated in 
obscurity are now subject to a model of open contribution. 
This is particularly the case in the Veillance domain and that 
of social computing as in some cases the data itself is a 
result of activities that are based upon recordings of 
activities using technologies bound by ethical constraints 
and privacy considerations. Identity awareness of research 
data is undeniably first and foremost concept used 
extensively to guide research activities in the eSciences, 
however it may transfer neatly to the research activities in 
the domains of Veillance and social computing.  
 
VI. DILEMMA IN VEILLANCE AND SOCIAL COMPUTING 
The explosion of emergent technologies in a research 
context provides new challenges for researchers and 
organisations alike in the collection, collation and curation 
of data. 
As we usher in a new era of interdisciplinary, 
transdisciplinary and collaborative data oriented research 
activities, researchers need support from their research 
organizations in their quest to manage data storage, access 
and re-use. By re-envisioning eResearch infrastructures 
there is a need for more than just discipline oriented or 
purpose specific secure research infrastructures to address 
the requirements of data intensive research activities.[25] 
Of great concern are organisations that purposefully lock 
down access to data generated as part of research activities 
in the domains of Veillance and social computing, 
challenged and misinformed of the intent underpinning the 
open data agenda. The dilemma for researchers in these 
domains is the misconception that the agenda is driven 
solely by funding mandates for scrutiny and exposes that 
which had previously remained under lock and key.  This 
mistrust in turn affects the agile methodological approach 
that researchers rely on to expedite research in a timely and 
competitive manner. 
By virtue of providing open access to research data, 
reuse is now shaping whole communities, where researchers 
are now at the forefront of actionable change, not simply 
librarianship without a mantle. The dilemma in the domains 
of Veillance and social computing can be resolved by 
organisations carefully engendering trust, by engaging key 
stakeholders through research communities in activities that 
dispel myths and provide greater insight into the identity 
awareness of research data. This awareness is particularly 
important where person or human subject related 
information is an integral part of those research activities 
undertaken. 
Managing person related information has become a new 
hot currency and an asset in fighting for the governance of 
the next phase of the Internet. Many leading data gatherers 
do massive business on personal data. Rights on the vast 
amounts of person related data are practically in the hands of 
data vendors and governments: they own this data, may 
make profit on it or provide personal data for a basis of 
decision-making. [26] It is evident that researchers 
supported by their organisations and who act out of an 
informed state of identity awareness of research data, make 
best use of data without compromising the subject in the 
process.   
CONCLUSION 
This paper provides evidence of the challenges that are 
faced by researchers in the domains of Veillance and social 
computing as they consider the identity awareness of 
research data in an endeavor for the re-use of research data. 
This paper also provides an account of the key 
components and conditions that guide data intensive 
research activities in the domains of Veillance and social 
computing in an effort to meet to varying degrees the 
requirements of identity awareness of research data. 
Clearly articulated connections between data, 
researchers, publications and research grants in this paper 
provide the impetus for researchers to strategise research 
activities to position themselves competitively in 
contemporary research ecosytems. A significant finding in 
this paper is that researchers have an opportunity to conduct 
research activities to position data as a valid and citable 
research output. 
This paper also identitifes barriers that are faced by 
researchers seeking to re-use datasets in the domains of 
Veillance and social computing, a need for a unified and co-
 ordinated international approach to identity awareness of 
research data and the ongoing challenges for researchers as 
they deal with privacy, security and well being of personally 
identifiable data [27] that emerges from research activities.
