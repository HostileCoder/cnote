Abstractﾑ A game BOT is a major threat in the online game 
industry. There have been many efforts to distinguish game BOT 
users from normal users. Several studies have proposed BOT 
detection models based on the analysis of usersﾕ in-game action 
sequence data. These studies indicated that the analysis of usersﾕ 
in-game actions is effective to detect BOTs. However, they do not 
use sufficiently large data sets to train and test their algorithms. 
In this paper, we have proposed a BOT detection model that uses 
usersﾕ in-game action sequence data obtained with the aid of big 
data analysis environments. We did empirical analysis of the 
dataset of ﾒBlade and Soulﾓ, the third largest MMORPG in 
Korea. The result shows that a large amount of sequence data 
leads to high accuracy.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
A game BOT is a well-crafted AI program that can play a 
game without any human interaction or control. Game BOTs 
can do harm and shorten the life cycle of the game [1]. We 
collaborated with NC Soft, Inc., one of the largest MMORPG 
service companies. We fully analyze long-term user activity 
logs with the aid of a big data analysis platform. 
II. RELATED WORK 
The studies for detecting game BOTs have been classified 
into three categories: server-side, network-side, and client-side 
[1, 2]. Network-side BOT detection assumes that traffic 
information, represents disparate characteristics of human 
players and BOTs [3]. Client-side detection methods acquire 
action data directly through user involvement. Server-side BOT 
detection methodology is based on data mining techniques that 
analyze log data from game servers. In general, it is hard to 
modify server-side logs with deliberate intent, unless hackers 
penetrate and compromise the game servers. Thus, server-side 
detection methods are more secure than client-side methods. 
Previous studies on server-side BOT detection methods 
selected features from a vast array of user actions, and applied 
data mining techniques [3, 4, 5, 6]. Most of these studies used 
one-dimensional log data due to computational complexity in 
spite of the fact that game BOT traces are found in multi-
 dimensional log data. 
We choose the usersﾕ in-game action log as a dataset. 
Whenever a user does an action (e.g. hunting) in the game 
world, then the game server generates an action log for each 
userﾕs action. We build the action sequence data from the 
dataset. The sequence data with time-stamp information is 
higher-dimensional. In this paper, we employ big data 
technology by Hadoop system for minimizing the loss of 
information. Additionally, Na夫e Bayesian is adopted in this 
study because the log data used is relatively large in terms of 
both its count and noise levels. 
III. EMPIRICAL STUDY 
A. Data Description 
In-game action stored in the game log represents the 
behavior of characters in the game. 110 kinds of log events 
were used for creating sequence patterns. Table 1 shows the 
information, including size and periods, of the training and test 
data. Before applying the sequence data for training, data 
preprocessing is needed to eliminate the insignificant data. The 
optimal sequence length ﾒkﾓ and the significant data frequency 
ﾒsﾓ are determined by the Apriori algorithm that makes explicit 
the relationship between data, based on the data frequency [7].

Training data 2012 32nd 41,467 750 million 1,187 
Test data 2012 33rd 40,364 570 million 829 
 
The data are separated into ﾒall sequence patternsﾓ and 
ﾒlimited number of sequence patternsﾓ to compare the 
performance of prediction rate based on the amount of 
information. Limited number of sequence patterns is decided 
according to the research by Ahmad et al. (2009) [3]. And 
twelve kinds of sequence patterns were selected. 
B. Analysis based on a simple scoring algorithm 
In this paper, the simple scoring algorithm used for 
classification [8] was applied to BOT detection by analyzing 
sequence data. The scoring algorithm for BOT detection is 
composed of three stages as shown is Fig. 1. 
 
Fig. 1. Scoring Process 
The BOT score for each sequence pattern is calculated by 
comparing normal userﾕs counts and BOTﾕs counts. These 
values are represented as a Boolean variable and score 1 
means the sequence pattern occurs more frequently in BOT. 
A characterﾕs BOT score is estimated by taking the average 
value of each characterﾕs sequence patterns. Cutoff value is 
decided as a minimum score of the BOT characters excepting 
outliers. In this case, characters having a BOT score greater 
than 0.76 are identified as BOT characters. 
C. Analysis based on the Na夫e Bayesian algorithm 
The Na夫e Bayesian algorithm was applied to email spam 
filters in the study by Androutsopoulos, et al. [9]. We applied 
the algorithm in our analysis as shown in (4) and (5).

 IV. RESULT OF ANALYSIS 
As a result, the optimal value of the length of the sequence 
pattern (k) and the minimum support rate (s) were decided, as 
shown in Table 2.

139 characters, investigated by three GM (Game Master) 
experts, were used for the evaluation. 79 characters were 
proved to be BOTs with no false positives. According to the 
result, the amount of input data has to be large enough to 
include a variety of information for the training algorithm. 
V. CONCLUSION 
A BOT detection model based on analyzing sequence data 
by Na夫e Bayesian algorithm is proposed in this study. We 
compared the results of all sequence patterns that had a value 
higher than that of limited number sequences. As a result, our 
analysis, used all kinds of sequence patterns, was more 
effective in identifying BOTs as the result showed the values 
for recall and precision were equivalent to 100% of the values 
that are applicable in the actual service area. Notwithstanding 
the contributions of this paper, in future work, the results can 
be compared to the results obtained by using other classifiers.
