I.  INTRODUCTION  
The data-centric "Big Data" era has arrived and the study 
on Big Data will become an important research direction of 
computer science for next period of time. United States 
Government vividly refers to Big Data as "the future of the 
new oil". Big Data will have a profound impact for the future 
of science and technology and economic development. The 
scale of having the data will become an important part of 
overall national strength as well as the ability to use the data in 
a country, and the possession of the data and control 
capabilities will also be a new standard for the measure of 
inter-state and inter-enterprise competitiveness [1]. 
Internet of things, cloud computing, mobile internet, car 
networking, mobile phone, tablet PC, PC and a wide variety of 
sensors throughout all corners of the earth are data source or 
carrying the way. The direct purpose of doing scientific 
research on Big Data is rapidly obtaining valuable information 
from a variety of types of data. Big Data can be divided into 
big data technology, big data projects, big data science and big 
data applications. The features of Big Data can be summarized 
as four "V", namely Volume, Variety, Value, Velocity. These 
four characteristics can be understood as: first, the data volume 
is huge, jumping from TB to PB; second, the data type is 
various, including blogs, videos, pictures, location information 
etc; third, the value density is low but the commercial value is 
high, such as surveillance video, potentially the useful data is 
only one or two seconds; fourth, the processing speed is quick, 
following Second Law of Big Data. 
In a variety of technical challenges in dealing with Big 
Data, a new data representation method that how to model Big 
Data is worthy of paying high attention, as it is the base 
understanding the meaning of the data and processing data. At 
present the method of representing data can not directly express 
the data itself significance. To effectively use the data and 
mining the knowledge, the most appropriate data representation 
should be found. If you want to find big data fixed pattern, 
causality and correlation in one kind of inappropriate data 
representation, you may fall into inherent prejudices [2]. Data 
representation method has a close relationship with initial data 
filler. If the original data is necessary for identification, it will 
greatly reduce the difficulty of the data identification and 
classification. However, causing the user so much trouble 
because of identifying the data is often not recognized by the 
users. Study on effective and simple data representation 
method is one of the technical problems which must be solved 
in the network big data processing. 
In view of the above problems, this paper proposes a big 
data modeling method of oriented electronic document. The 
core of this method is representing knowledge of electronic 
document and building Big Data model of electronic document 
using of ontology meta-model architecture. Thus it can form a 
Big Data reduction of knowledge base of electronic document 
and lays a solid foundation to meet the high quality of 
personalized and diversified needs. And this paper achieves 
modeling process based on ontology meta-model architecture 
through the case. 
II. ONTOLOGY AND METAMODEL FRAMEWORK 
Ontology is formal and explicit specification of a shared 
conceptualization. The ontology we can define concepts and 
relationships among concepts. We can define the concept and 
represent the relationship among the various concepts taking 
advantage of ontology [3]. Ontology is the study of the nature 
of existence and its intrinsic relationship. The research object 
of ontology is the nature of existence and its internal 
relationship. In cognition, ontology is a set of concepts talking 
about within a certain range of knowledge with a granularity 
and a kind of semantic agreement they give. 
A. Ontology 
 
Ontology element modeling is a meta-theory, and it can 
unify understanding for a problem in the field of research, also

eliminate conflict and confusion of understanding because of 
different application backgrounds. Therefore, in the semantic 
services environment, ontology-based information model is 
suitable to solve problems of heterogeneous information and so 
on. The model can achieve communication and exchange 
between human and computer systems and among systems. 
Semantic sharing and collaborative work can be well reflected  
in the model. 
The ultimate goal of ontology element modeling is to 
achieve the semantic interoperability between various objects. 
The standard measure of semantic interoperability is the 
semantic interoperability capabilities. Semantic interoperability 
capability refers to the ability exchanging the data of precise 
meaning between two objects, and the receiving side can 
accurately translate or convert the information carried by the 
data and the knowledge carried by the information. Namely 
information and knowledge can be understood, it brings about 
the result of an effective cooperative behavior finally, and the 
effectiveness confirmation of results is agreed by the two 
interoperable sides [4]. Semantic interoperability capability is 
divided into the following three levels: 
1) Complete semantic interoperability:  
It is also known as deep semantic interoperability. In other 
words both parties fully understand the semantics of the 
agreement. 
2) Partial semantic interoperability: 
 Both parties only can understand the part semantic of the 
agreement. 
3) No semantic interoperability:  
It appears no semantic interoperability including syntax (or 
structure) interoperability, when semantic interoperability 
capabilities below a certain threshold. 
B. Meta-Model Framework 
RGPS meta model framework is composed by the meta 
model of four levels including Role-Goal-Process-Service, 
namely, Role layer, Goal layer, Process layer, Service layer. 
RGPS meta-model framework is able to provide strong support 
for interoperability through the association between the four-
 level meta-model [5]. 
The hierarchical relationship between RGPS meta-model is 
shown in Figure 1. The modeling process based on RGPS starts 
on the analysis of the organizational structure of the demand 
problem space and ends on generating the solutions based on 
service by mapping and transformation between levels. Role 
layer meta-model describes organizations, roles, participants 
and their interaction in the space. Goal layer meta-model 
depicts a process refining the user's goal layer by layer, and 
determines the relationship of mutual restraint between the 
objectives [6]. Process layer meta-model describes the process 
used to achieve their goals, and defines the control structures of 
the process, input or output as well as pre or post conditions. 
Service layer meta-model pictures the service chain structure 
used to implement the process and polymerization of the 
resources needed, and provides service-based implementations 
for the user’s needs. 
 
Figure 1.  Role-Goal-Process-Service meta-model of the relationship  
A domain modeling method O-RGPS for specific areas on 
the basis of RGPS meta-model framework was proposed under 
the guidance of ontology element modeling method. In O-
 RGPS domain modeling method the basic output result of 
domain modeling is domain knowledge base, including domain 
ontology (O) and the domain model (RGPS). They are core 
assets in two areas. O represents domain ontology, including 
the domain entity ontology, domain operation ontology and 
domain situation ontology. The three categories ontology and 
their mutual semantic association ensure semantic 
collaboration between the domain models. 
III. ELECTRONIC DOCUMENT MODELING METHOD 
Role assumes appropriate role goal. Actor prefers his own 
personal goal. Process of goal decomposition ends until 
acquiring operability goals. Process can achieve those 
operability goals, and also be completed through cooperation 
between processes. Service can perform the corresponding 
process, and achieve those objectives. 
A. RGPS Association Meta Model 
In order to facilitate service selection, the association rules 
between RGPS should be registered in each registered base. 
Role, goal, process and the correspondingly multiple 
constraints between services should also be maintained. These 
constraints can be used to check whether or not the registration 
information is in the approved status. When the corresponding 
constraint relationship (relationship between models) is 
satisfied, the corresponding registration information is in the 
approved status. A service can only achieve a goal. When we 
register the service in the registration database, the service can 
still be registered in an unauthorized state, although the 
corresponding goal instance does not exist. Only when the 
corresponding goal instance exists and the relationships 
between them have been established, the corresponding 
registration information is only in an approved status. The 
registration information satisfying the constraint relationships 
benefit searching candidate services to meet user’s needs 
according to the association rules between RGPS. 
B. Electronic Document Modeling Process 
Under the guidance of RGPS requirements meta-modeling 
framework, the electronic document modeling process can be 
regarded as a demand-driven modeling process. This process 
includes the following stages: first, role and goal extraction of 
domain specific; second, process analysis of application 
specific; third, extracting ontology of electronic document in 
830
specific areas. This process is not a one-way process, but is a 
process which needs to interactive feedback and iteration with 
the users. 
1) Role and Goal Extraction of Domain Specific 
The guidance of role layer meta-model is reflected in: 
describing organization, role and their interaction and 
collaboration in the demand problem; guiding to extract 
business rules in the demand problem; portraying the personal 
goal of actor-participants of role; describing the organizational 
responsibility which the role should bear. The analysis of role 
layer occupies an important basic position in RGPS element 
modeling framework [7]. Because role reflects the information 
which interrelates with the user’s organization, this information 
plays a crucial role for ensuring the completeness and 
consistency of requirements. When the user proposes 
requirements, the user’s role should be first cleared. Then 
according to his role we infer role objectives to improve the 
user's needs, which some users have not yet made, but which is 
also communal in such roles. 
The guidance of goal layer meta-model is reflected in: 
guiding to distinguish the type of destination, such as 
functional goal, non-functional goal and operational goal; 
directing goal to decompose longitudinally; instructing to 
define the horizontal restraints relationship between goals; 
clearing the relationship with the elements of role layer model 
and further inducting to the process layer modeling. 
2) Process Analysis of Application Specific 
The guidance of process layer meta-model is reflected in: 
distinguishing the combinational process and atomic processes; 
determining the quality expectations of the process; guiding 
construction of the composite process on the basis of control 
structure; clearing input and output of the process as well as pre 
and post conditions. 
3) Extracting Ontology of Electronic Document in Specific 
Areas 
The role of ontology is reflected in: ontology as 
requirements specification. In other words, we establish 
ontology in specific areas, and provide knowledge base using 
the ontology for creating needs of multiple goal application 
system. In this case, ontology can be seen as a common domain 
model [8]. As the basis of establishing requirement 
specification of application system and system development in 
field, the reuse of knowledge can be performed. 
In the domain modeling methods of RGPS, the basic output 
result is the domain knowledge base for domain modeling, 
including the domain ontology (O) and the domain model 
(RGPS). O represents domain ontology, including the domain 
entity ontology, domain operation ontology and domain 
situation ontology. The three categories ontology and their 
mutual semantic association ensure semantic collaboration 
between the domain models. Because web service is the basic 
units of network-based software, the structure of ontology must 
be taken into providing needs of semantic support for the web 
service. The relevant ontology in web service demands to 
define service parameters (data structure) and the type of 
service functions. In addition, the structure of ontology must 
also be taken into the need of modeling. In the goal modeling, 
functional goals include three basic components: operation, 
object and method. The operation is the concept of the verb in 
the field, and the object is the concept of the noun in the field. 
IV. CASE STUDY 
In e-government there are many relevant electronic 
documents. There are two roles which are called the buyer and 
seller, the buyer is required by law to housing ownership 
transfer to the seller. The whole process of implementation 
involves a large number of electronic document, such as: the 
transfer of relevant laws and regulations, various document 
and a copy of the registration form, and so all kinds of 
information. 
A. Role and Goal 
In this use case involves major roles include the buyer, 
seller, official and so on. Buyer and seller in the process of 
civil service completed all housing transfer process and 
ultimately achieved the housing transfer targets under the 
guidance and assistance. In order to get the role of the e-
 government application scenario and target models,O-RGPS 
domain modeling tool was used,shown in Figure 2.

B. Analysis of housing transfer process 
Since the goal layer has a decomposition of the goals, 
indicating the dependencies between the goals and therefore 
can be easily obtained in the process housing transfer layer 
model, shown in Figure 3.

C. Electronic Document  Ontology 
In RGPS domain ontology, there are entity ontology and 
operating ontology. Entity ontology describes the concepts and 
entities in the field of semantic relationship. Operating 
ontology defines the operational and functional concepts and 
their semantic relationships. 
On the one hand, the concept of physical entities can be 
used as the data type of the service parameters, and the 
operating concept of the types of services can be provided. On 
the other hand, for the three elements of the functional 
objectives <operation, objects, methods>, the operation is the 
operation of the core concepts of the ontology, and the object is 
the core concepts. Thus, you can ensure that the target 
matching accuracy and completeness through semantic support 
of two types of ontology during the target search and matching. 
Protégé is used to model the ontology. Protégé is a widely 
used ontology editing tool. It is an open source and Java-based 
Semantic Web ontology editor which provides an extensible 
architecture that allows user to create customized applications. 
Electronic document associated with the domain ontology are 
constructed, shown in Figure 4.

V. RELATED WORKS 
Parallel database originated in the 1980s, and it was 
supported by standard SQL and realized the many advanced 
technologies over the past 30 years. Parallel database used 
shared nothing architecture and divided relational tables 
between nodes horizontally. The goal of parallel database is 
high performance and high availability. 
MapReduce was proposed in 2004 by Google for Big Data 
programming model. Initially MapReduce was mainly used for 
Internet data processing, such as document capture, inverted 
index creation, but now it is widely used in the machine 
learning, data mining, data analysis, and other fields because of 
its simple yet powerful data processing interface and massively 
parallel execution. MapReduce data processing tasks will be 
abstracted as a series of Map and Reduce. Map is mainly for 
data filtering operation, Reduce mainly to complete the data 
gathering operation. Input and output data are <key, value> 
format. Users simply follow their own familiar language to 
realize Map function and Reduce function, and MapReduce 
framework will automatically divide the tasks to be done in 
parallel. 
VI. CONCLUSIONS 
This paper presents a Big Data modeling method oriented 
electronic document, which is the core element model using 
ontology framework for knowledge representation of electronic 
document. Big Data model is built for electronic document, 
thus forming a Big Data reduction electronic document 
repository, for high quality to meet customer’s needs.
