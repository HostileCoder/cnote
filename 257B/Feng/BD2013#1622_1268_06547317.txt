ABSTRACT 
 
Palmprint is widely used biometric feature in biometric and 
forensic applications, however it is still a challenging task to 
process the images and extract the useful data, because the 
evidence, left at the crime scenes, are usually deformed and 
distorted by artifacts. Palmprint contains different types of 
visible features that can be used for identification of 
criminals, including big details, like crease, ridge flow, and 
small details, like ridges, valleys and minutiae points. 
In this paper we focus on ridge extraction task. We 
demonstrate how integration of angular preference to an 
existing algorithm (Non-Halo Complex Matched Filtering, 
NH-CMF) may significantly improve quality of extracted 
features. We introduce the approach where NH-CMF and 
automated analysis of magnitude weighted angle histogram 
are used for ridge pattern extraction and noise reduction. 
Extracted information may support or even automate ridge 
routing that is necessary for palmprint feature extraction in 
forensics.

1. INTRODUCTION 
 
Palmprints share many of the discriminative features with 
fingerprints however they posses larger skin area and 
therefore provide more features to be analyzed. Palmprint 
recognition is widely used in biometric applications, such as 
access control and because about 30% of the latents 
recovered from crime scenes are from palms, they are also 
used in forensics [1].  
Visible palmprint details can be subdivided into two groups: 
big details, like ridge flow direction and crease, and small 
details, like individual ridges, valleys, minutiae points (ridge 
endings and splits), islands and even pores on the ridges 
(Fig. 1) [2].  
In this work we concentrate on the visible small palmprint 
details – individual ridges and their tracking. 
Since palmprint ridges appear in images as lines that are 
darker than the surrounding valleys, line detection 
algorithms may be used to extract them. State of the art 
techniques incorporate enhancement of the image quality by 
phase congruency [3], image processing with edge detection 
methods and conversion into binary representation by 
thresholding the pixel intensities [4]. Other advanced 
palmprint image processing techniques involve wavelets [5], 
Zernike moments [6] and Phase-Only Correlation [7].

Since the images usually are distorted, simple region 
growing algorithm for ridge tracking cannot be used, 
therefore, information of several adjacent ridges becomes 
useful. Also, other palmprint details, like crease, usually 
appear one by one, not in groups of parallel lines, therefore 
they can be distinguished from ridges. 
The cross section of several adjacent ridges form a pattern of 
repeating minimums and maximums, that can be 
approximated with harmonic functions, like sine wave [8]. 
Therefore, the transforms, based on these functions, such as 
2D Fourier and Wavelet transforms [5], as well as filters, 
derived from them, such as Gabor filters [9], may be used to 
clear the unwanted noises. 
In this research we extend the idea of Non-Halo Complex 
Matched Filtering (NH-CMF) from [10], therefore, for 
increased clarity, this method is described in details in the 
978-1-4673-4989-5/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 
next two sections. Then we present our modifications to the 
method and discuss the acquired results. 
 
 
 
2. RELATED WORK 
 
Complex Matched Filtering algorithm was introduced in 
[11]. Being developed for palm vein image processing in 
biometrics [12], it showed a simple approach for extraction 
of line-like objects (LLO), such as lines and edges, of 
arbitrary directions and even scales (latter depends on the 
kernel parameters). The approach was based on matched 
filtering and mainly presented the method of combining 
several matched filtering results into one, using complex 
coefficients. 
The result of CMF is a matrix of vectors ( )yxv ,arrowrightnosp  (further 
called as an “output image”), which has the same dimensions 
as the input image ( )yxf , . Each output vector ( )yxv ,arrowrightnosp  is 
assigned to the corresponding pixel of the input image 
( )yxf , . Magnitude of the acquired vector ( )yxv ,arrowrightnosp  shows 
how similar is the pixel's neighborhood to the LLO, and the 
angle of this vector ( )( )yxvArg ,arrowrightnosp  shows the direction of 
found LLO. Therefore, not only the LLO's are extracted 
during CMF, but also the image is prepared for the 
segmentation (e. g. contour tracking) procedure. Angular 
information provided by the CMF, in the each image pixel, 
points in the direction where the next pixel of the same LLO 
most probably will appear. Thus, the line/contour tracking 
task is simplified. 
However, in its initial form, the CMF had a disadvantage of 
producing the Halo Artifact – false vectors around the 
extracted regions. In [10], this problem was investigated, the 
CMF method was improved and the Halo artifact 
appearance was eliminated. The Non-Halo CMF (NH-CMF) 
showed a performance that is visually comparable to the 
result of matched filtering, while still providing the 
additional information about LLO direction. 
 
3. NON-HALO COMPLEX MATCHED FILTERING 
 
Consider the input image ( )yxf ,  and the line detection 
matched filter kernel ( )nyxM ?;, , which can be rotated to 
arbitrary angle of 
pi? ?=
 N
 n
 n ,  (1) 
where N is total count of used angles and n = 0…(N–1). 
Figure 2 shows the rotated kernel, which is used in this 
experiment (left), compared to the ridge pattern it supposed 
to match (right). 
The cross-correlation value ( )nn yxs ?;, 00  of this kernel 
(placed with its center in pixel ( )00 , yx ) with the underlying 
image region is defined by the following equation:

      (2) 
The summation of values is accomplished within the kernel 
boundaries D for variables x and y. To process the image 
according to the CMF or NH-CMF algorithm, it is first 
necessary to correlate the image with all possible rotated 
kernels, acquiring matched filtering values ( )nn yxs ?;, 00  
for each n and in each image pixel ( )00 , yx . Each of the N 
values shows the similarity between the image region around 
( )00 , yx  and the kernel. This feature was exploited in [10] to 
prevent filter from processing negative values of correlation 
(which results in a Halo Artifact production), and will be 
exploited in this work for the other purpose. 
The Halo Artifact is removed by eliminating any negative 
values of correlation from further processing:

The algorithm continues with the doubled angle assignment 
and summation, which can be expressed in form:

and, finally, the angle decrement: 
( ) ( ) ( )( )yxcArgjeyxcyxv ,5.0,, arrowrightnosparrowrightnosparrowrightnosp ??= . (5) 
 
The acquired vectors smoothly follow the direction of the 
detected ridges, as shown in Figure 3 (up), but this is not 
always the case. 
More frequently, the palmprint images, which are used as 
forensic evidence, contain the ridge structure, that is hardly 
noticeable and is covered with noise, artifacts or crease of 
other direction. In this case the NH-CMF becomes useless, 
because it is aimed to detect individual lines, not a set of 
overlapping lines (Figure 3 (down)). 
The possible application of NH-CMF in ridge tracking task 
in the field of forensics makes it an interesting challenge to 
adapt this algorithm to handle images, where differently 
oriented lines (ridges and crease) are overlapped, but must 
be detected separately.

ridge structure (up), and overlapped with crease – a problematic 
area (down) 
 
4. DETECTION AND SEPARATION OF THE 
OVERLAPPING LINES 
 
In the case of overlapping lines, NH-CMF detects all of 
them scattered around the image region. Therefore, 
statistical approaches can be used to analyze their 
significance and directions. For this task we use magnitude 
weighted angle histogram (MWAH). Suppose having a set 
of I vectors { Iivi ...1; =
 arrowrightnosp }, where I is the pixel count in the 
analyzed image region. Let iv
 arrowrightnosp
  be the magnitude of vectors, 
and ( )? ?ivArg arrowrightnosp  be the floored angle (in degrees). The 
magnitude weighted angle histogram h can then be defined 
by the following equation: 
 
( )
 ( )? ?
 ∑
 =?
 =
 kvArgi
 i
 i
 vkh
 arrowrightnosp
 arrowrightnosp
 ,
 ,  (6) 
where k is the analyzed angle in degrees, k=0…179. Thus, 
we ensure that the vectors that have longest magnitude have 
biggest impact on the calculated histogram values. 
For non-problematic image regions, where clear pattern of 
similarly oriented ridges is present, the MWAH will always 
show one dominating peak, denoting the ridge flow direction 
(Fig. 4 (left)). For problematic regions, the MWAH presents 
multiple peaks (Fig. 4 (right)), each peak corresponds to the 
different LLO being overlapped. The analysis of MWAH 
peaks allows us to choose the preferred LLO direction as 
well as to know the direction and proportion of the unwanted 
details. We analyze MWAH for partially overlapping 
regions of 71x71 pixels, chosen as a tradeoff between 
computation speed and statistical precision of MWAH. 
Once the direction of interest ?’(x,y) is found (in radians), 
the detail rejection function r(?) can be formulated, for 
example, as in (7).

5. APPLIED ALGORITHM MODIFICATIONS 
 
We leave matched filtering part of the NH-CMF algorithm, 
which is performed by (2) and (3), unchanged. Since the 
acquired values ( )nn yxc ?;,  represent the image fragment 
match with the filter kernel, and we don’t need the details of 
unwanted angles to be matched, next thing we apply is the 
match rejection: 
 
( ) ( )( ) ( )nnnnn yxcyxryxc ???? ;,,';,' ??=  (8) 
 
Further algorithm continues unchanged:

( ) ( ) ( )( )yxcArgjeyxcyxv ,'5.0,',' arrowrightnosparrowrightnosparrowrightnosp ??= .  (10) 
 
The result is NH-CMF with angular preference, and the 
preferred angle is defined by value ( )yx,'?  for each pixel. 
The processing of an image consists of two steps:  
1. The input image is processed with original NH-
 CMF. 
As a result the output image ( )yxv ,arrowrightnosp  is acquired and 
analyzed with MWAH. The preferred angle ( )yx,'?  for 
each image region is assigned, according to MWAH peaks. 
In our experiment, the highest peak’s angle was 
automatically chosen. 
2. The input image is processed again, using the 
modified NH-CMF, taking the angular preference 
into account. 
 
6. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION 
 
The method described in this paper shows how 
incorporating the NH-CMF and MWAH it is possible to 
improve the filtration result of a palmprint. Figure 5 shows 
the comparison of NH-CMF and proposed modified version 
of NH-CMF with angular preference. The output image 
( )yxv ,'arrowrightnosp  shows the improvement of filtration quality over the 
original NH-CMF (Fig. 5 (middle) over Fig. 5 (left) and Fig. 
5 (right) over Fig. 3 (down)). Using angular preference we 
are able to fine-tune filter performance to detect only details 
of interest, and after refiltering the image, some details that 
were not seen after first filtration become visible. However, 
when dealing with images of such low quality it is important 
to be careful with image processing methods, because false 
detections may occur, which is unacceptable in forensics.
