 Abstract— Urban growth may lead to various problems. The
 increasing number of citizens at urban areas may lead the
 increasing of demand such as new residential, public health,
 public transport. A city require basic infrastructure such as
 educational facilities, housing, clean water, sanitation, solid
 waste, electricity, telecommunications and so on. In the socio-
 economic level the increasing of city residents must be supplied
 with availability of jobs. A city must be managed and planned
 well to handle problems such as traffic congestion, air quality,
 water quality, water supply, energy supplies, and public health
 quality and so on. At this paper, we proposed tool using
 information technology and communication (ICT) to help local
 government to monitoring what currently happened in the city.
 We proposed application for monitoring city in single dashboard
 to help summarize the current condition of city. The architecture
 system use network sensor consisting of sensor nodes that has
 function to capture city condition like temperature, air pollution,
 water pollution, traffic situation. Also we can add another
 information socio-economic situation like public health service,
 economic indicator, energy supplies, etc. We have successfully
 developed the prototype of the smart city dashboard the give
 more accurate information of Bandung City, one of big cities in
 Indonesia.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 The increasing numbers of population in urban or city areas
 create high demand and cause new problems [1]. The problem
 like difficulty in waste management, scarcity of resources, air
 pollution, human health concerns, traffic congestions, and
 inadequate, deteriorating and aging infrastructures are among
 the more basic technical, physical, and material problems
 [1].Urban areas always needs basic infrastructure such as
 educational facilities, housing, clean water, sanitation, solid
 waste, electricity and telecommunications and so on.
 Some of the problems occurred mostly in the cities such as:
 The complexity of urban transport and congestion
 problems
 Health care issues
 Waste management, especially in big cities
 Environment issues such as air quality, water
 supply and quality, etc.
 Disaster may occur in urban area such as floods,
 landslides, etc. Some disasters such as floods can
 be caused by poor city planning.
 Problems caused from cities always related with multiple
 and diverse stakeholders [1]. So, Information technology and
 communication (ICT can be empowered to help to manage the
 city. ICT can be empowered to monitor and record what
 happens at some specific city area to be reported and acted
 upon. With ICT assistance, some problems can be recorded
 quickly and find the solutions as soon as possible. Thus, the
 city situation will be more easily to monitor, manage and create
 some decisions. The stakeholder of this system is not only for
 the local government but also urban community can also
 monitor and participate at what happening in a city. Some
 studies associated it with smart city.
 In some perspective, smart city relies on a collection of
 smart computing technologies applied to ICT infrastructure [2].
 Smart computing can reflect technology of integrated
 hardware, software, and network with real-time awareness of
 the real world. From the results, it can be evaluated by
 advanced analytics to help stakeholder decide more intelligent
 decisions and do some actions that will optimize business
 function. [2].
 Smart City could be defined as city that can predict and
 accommodate the citizens need. Implementation of ICT
 technology to make the city smarter could be done in areas
 such as transport, health and other public services. Smart City
 concept can be supported at the highest levels of city
 government and has contributed to the daily needs of citizens
 [3]. For a smart city, all activities related to public services can
 be managed by developing a platform (dashboard) for
 monitoring all relevant data. Visualization of data can result a
 variety of indicators, where stakeholders can make decision in
 the city planning or city managing [3],[4].
 Monitoring the city conditions can be done with sensor
 networks. Sensors can be placed at certain places to capture
 important data. Wireless Sensor Networking (WSN) solutions
 for Smart Cities are being driven by standards such as IEEE
 802.15.4 and ZigBe and other standards.
 From previous work, we have developed part of smart city
 concept consist of to monitor environmental and disaster early
warning system [5]. In this paper, we extend the research for all
 basic need monitoring visualized on single dashboard.
 II. RELATED RESEARCH
 System with the Information and communication
 technology (ICT) can help provide accurate and precise
 information about city situation. The problems such as:
 transportation, congestion, health, education, environment
 (waste, water, air quality) and disaster could be identified
 earlier. The concept of smart city usually integrated with use of
 information and communication technology (ICT)
 infrastructure especially for monitoring, management and
 decision making tool [4].
 The implementation of smart city may various depend on
 the need on each city. Some big cities in the world has started
 to implement Smart City Project such as Amsterdam[6],
 Lyon[7], Santader[8], Endesas[9], Aarhus[10] and many
 others. Amsterdam is one of big city that has successfully
 implemented smart city like in Fig. 1.
 Fig. 1 Amsterdam Smart City [6]
 Some of important information of city could be
 summarized into dashboard like in Fig. 2 [11]. Information
 about weather, forecasting, air pollution, river level, economic
 indicator such as stock, station, traffic condition are displayed
 in single dashboard [11]. This useful information could be used
 for stakeholders to get information more accurately, faster and
 then make some decisions.

 III. SYSTEM DESIGN
 At this section, we describe about the system design. We
 begin with an overview of system architecture. We also
 describe about the integration network sensor into TCP/IP
 network with certain communication protocol.
 A. Architecture
 The architecture for monitoring city could be seen at Fig. 3.
 The system consists of network sensors, server and internet
 network. Network sensors are collection of sensors placed in
 certain place for specific purpose. The sensors have main
 function for data collecting. The data from sensor are sent to
 server via Remote Terminal Unit (RTU).  Server can be
 equipped with a database or GIS (Geographical Information
 System) features. The connection between network sensor and
 server use internet or TCP/IP network. In the server side, it can
 use cloud computing infrastructure.
 The data transmission can be done using gateway or using
 Telecommunication network such as GPRS. Some researches
 also successfully developed radio transmitting to send data
 using GPRS radio [12]-[18].
 B. Integrating Network Sensor into internet
 To interconnect between network sensor with the server
 and the users, it can be used internet. Internet can be used as
 basic network underlying because mostly network hardware
 support with IP-Based.
 C. Communication Protocol
 As previous work, we have proposed communication
 protocol to integrating network sensor into internet [19][7],
 [20]. Based on our basic design, the sensors must report
 periodically to the server via network.  The commonly network
 used are internet or TCP/IP network based. From previous
 work, we have already defined the basis of Finite Time
 Response (FTR) Protocol as follow [20]:
 )(0
 )(1
 1 MaxTRrif
 MaxTRrifP
 i
 i
 i (1)
 1iP = Next mode at next duty cycle period (i+1)It has only 2 values consist of 0 or 1.
 0 indicates that at the next duty cycle
 period node must be entering on
 sleep mode (force sleep). It means
 that node isn’t allowed to send data at
 some period.
 1 indicates that at the next duty cycle
 period node allowed to transmit data
 to server.
 ir
 = Response time at duty cycle period-i
 (second)
 MaxTR = Parameter of maximum response time
 allowed (second)
Note that we defined force sleep as a period when a node
 entering phase of postpone to send data for several time. At
 this paper, we defined the duration of force sleep not only
 single duty cycle period only, but we can define as follow:
 TKT FS .
 FST = Duration for force sleep period (second)
 K = Constant multiplier to indicate duration of
 force sleep
 T = Duration for single duty cycle time  (second)
 The duration of sleep (force sleep) is K times of duty
 cycle. Note that we use parameter K as control parameter to
 achieve level of performance. We can describe that parameter
 K can control the average performance like average response
 time.
 The basic function of this method is to maintain
 performance always on the certain value. We need to balance
 between the performance like average response time (end-to-
 end delay), energy efficiency and also periodic updating to
 server.

 D. User Application
 The system provides application for the users. The
 summaries of city could be displayed on single dashboard.
 Data from various sensors are collected and recorded in
 databases. Then, the last value can be displayed in
 dashboard. Users can find information about current
 condition of the city from this dashboard application. The
 results from sensor reading also can be displayed on
 dashboard application.
 IV. RESULT AND DISCUSSION
 The application of sensor network applications for city
 monitoring has implemented into city dashboard application
 like in Fig. 4. The project was implemented on Bandung, one
 of big city in Indonesia. As a big city, Bandung has grown
 very fast. Bandung has many problems and many situations
 that need to be monitor or controlling. The number of citizen,
 the number of vehicle, the number of housing and industry
 must be controlled and monitored. Users of application can
 monitor the condition of the city such as temperature,
 humidity, traffic situation, current public service status.
Fig. 4 Sample of Smart City Dashboard Application
 It is prototype project with small number of sensor. In this
 pilot project, we set that our system can implement with any
 kind type of sensor. It done well with configuration of Remote
 Terminal Unit when only receive signal in voltage only. At the
 future, we can place the sensors like temperature and humidity
 sensors at certain points in the city to get actual value from the
 fields. We can also place environmental sensors at the place
 with very high pollution.
 The users of system can also add or view additional
 information of the city such as public health infrastructure,
 environment state, energy supplies, economic indicator, etc.
 Other information such as traffic conditions or maps of public
 services can also be displayed.
 V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
 This study has implemented prototype system of smart city
 dashboard at Bandung. It consists of network sensor, server,
 application and also communication protocol which is used for
 city monitoring. The summary information of city can be
 displayed in single view to help people watching, analyzing and
 action to what being happen to city.
 In the future, we can add more analytical tool or business
 intelligence to get more precise evaluation like prediction or
 decision system support (DSS) tool.
