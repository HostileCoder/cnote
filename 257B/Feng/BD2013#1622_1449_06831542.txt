 Abstract—With the increasingly rapid growth of micro-
 blogging services, influence analysis is becoming a very important
 topic in this area. Sina Weibo, one of the largest mirco-blogging
 services in China, has provided a new operation comment-only,
 which allows users to give feedback on a post without forwarding.
 However, most of existing works focus on Twitter, which fail
 to consider this new operation. In paper, we propose a new
 influence measurement method called WeiboRank on Sina Weibo
 which applies comment-only operation to help researchers to find
 ignored influential users who have big influential in comment
 dimension. Furthermore we analyze why a particular user is
 influential based on tracing the source of influence to find out
 which aspects contribute to influence. Our experiments based
 on a subset of a whole Sina Weibo datatset, which includes
 three-month records of 22,514,394 users. We conduct extensive
 experiments and results show that we can accurately find the
 most influential individuals among entire social networks, while
 the running time of the algorithm increases linearly with any
 increase in data size, which is suitable for large scale networks.
 I. INTRODUCTION
 Nowadays, micro-blogging services, such as Twitter,
 Google+ and Sina Weibo, have become an important way
 to keep up with the news and exchange information. It not
 only provides a new way to collect huge data set that reflects
 behaviour patterns of users in large scale networks, but also
 affects people in the real world. Twitter, as the original mirco-
 blogging service, has been studied for the past several years.
 Besides Twitter, a similar platform, called Sina Weibo, one of
 the Chinas largest micro-blogging services, gained 200 million
 registered users from August 2009 to August 2011. Studies on
 the properties of micro-blogging formed by user relationships
 and interactions have attracted much interest. Analyzing the
 social influence of celebrities in online social networks (OSNs)
 has attracted many researchers. This is mainly due to the many
 benefits, such as helping us to better understand what the latest
 trends are and how advertising can be more effective in the
 online commercial field.
 There are several methods to measure influence based
 on different online platforms, in particular, Twitter [1]–[8].
 However, there are several limitations to these previous works.
 First, Sina Weibo exclusively provides a new operation called
 comment-only so that existing works are not suitable for this
 platform. Second, previous works have mainly focused on the
 accuracy of identifying influential users and the efficiency of
 the algorithm, while they do not theoretically analyze why a
 particular user is important.
 In order to overcome the above two shortcomings, we
 propose a influence measurement called WeiboRank which
 considers comment-only. Comment-only can reflect the in-
 formation feeback ability which Twitter cannot. Furthermore,
 the comment-only operation can avoid “follower-buying” and
 “retweet-buying” where two business cases can purchase some
 accounts to follow a particular user or retweet others tweet to
 build a fake social influence. WeiboRank consists of two parts:
 a single-dimension influential measurement and identifying
 influence people via Skyline. In the first part, we devise
 a influential measurement method based on PageRank to
 evaluate the influence under a single dimension and in the
 second part, we leverage Skyline [10] to extend the influence
 result into follow, repost and comment dimensions to help
 identify influential people in the Sina Weibo dataset. Then
 we introduce a new concept called “dependence” to trace the
 source of influence. Tracing the source of influence helps us to
 understand why a particular user is influential as we discover
 which factors and users contribute to the influence.
 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that ana-
 lyzes the social influence with the consideration of comment-
 only. The contributions of this paper are threefold:
 • We based on the real dataset to compare the differences
 between Twitter and Sina Weibo and study the rela-
 tionship between comment, repost and follow through
 qualitative and quantitative aspects. We show that existing
 methods for Twitter are not suitable for Sina Weibo.
 • We propose a novel method called WeiboRank which
 considers the new operation: comment, to help re-
 searchers to evaluate the influence score to find the under-
 valued influential users based on Sina Weibo. Moreover,
 our method combines comment, follower and repost three
 dimensions together to generate the final influential users.
 • We analyze why a particular user is important based on
 tracing the source of influence in the real Sina Weibo
 dataset which includes 22,514,394 user’s record in three

 months. The results show that different users have differ-
 ent influential source and verify again that the source of
 repost influence and comment influence is different.
 The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section II
 presents observations on Sina Weibo vs. Twitter and states
 the problem. Details about the novel influence measurement
 method called WeiboRank discussed in Section III. Section IV
 analyzes why a particular user is influential based on tracing
 its source of influence. In Section V the experimental results
 show that we can find most of the influential individuals in
 the Sina Weibo. Some related work is listed in Section VI.
 Finally, we summarize the paper in Section VII and discuss
 future work.
 II. PRELIMINARIES
 A. Sina Weibo vs. Twitter
 In Twitter, there are only two types of operations provided:
 • retweet: retransmit the original tweet to their followers;
 • reply: respond to or comment to others’ tweets, as long
 as retweeting.
 Users can retweet or reply a tweet as shown in Figure 1(a)
 and 1(b). Both retweet and reply operations retransmit the
 original tweet, which means if a user retweets or replies to
 a tweet, his or her followers can receive the original tweet.
 In Sina Weibo, three types of operations are provided:
 • repost-only: similar to retweet in Twitter;
 • repost-and-comment: similar to reply in Twitter;

(b) Influence Score Without Node A

 • comment-only: similar to reply in Twitter but without
 retweeting.
 As shown in Figure 1(c), Sina Weibo allows users to
 comment and repost at the same time. If a user does not choose
 the repost-and-comment operation, the user will do repost-only
 or comment-only operations. Both Repost and Repost-and-
 comment retransmit the original post, which operates similarly
 to Twitter. However, Sina Weibo has comment-only. If the user
 adopts this new operation, the comment will only show under
 the original post as in the bottom of Figure 1(c) and that user’s
 followers are unable to access the comment and original post.
 The comment-only operation is the key difference between
 Sina Weibo and Twitter, because Twitter does not distinguish
 between the effects of retransmission and the comment oper-
 ation. Repost and comment are two different ways to transmit
 information in Sina Weibo, however, the repost operation is
 mainly focused on the retransmission of information. It also
 has a stronger ability to diffuse information. However, the
 comment operation mainly focused on the feedback ability
 and communication ability of information.
 B. Problem Definition
 There are two definitions which need to be declared before
 we state the problem.
 1) Evaluating Social Influence: In our work, we consider
 the new operation, comment-only and adopt Page Rank to
 evaluate influence in Sina Weibo.
 2) Tracing the Source of Influence: Some scholars exploit
 entities social influence by analyzing the topological structure.
 Such influence can be considered as the social standing of
 entities, is usually measured by scoring functions. Different
 vertices in a social network may have different scoring func-
 tion values. However, what makes such difference in values?
 Example 1: Figure 2(b) represents the induced subgraph of
 Figure 2(a) by voiding the links connecting to B. The labeled
 number on vertices represents the a link-based authority mea-
 sure. In order to analyze the dependency from A to B, we
 separate the vertex A from the network by disconnecting its
 links. If A can effect the influence score of B, we say that A
 is one of the sources of influence on B. If edge {A,B} was
 disconnected, the influential score B decrease dramatically.
 We say there has a strong interdependency between A and B.
 Otherwise, we say that is has a weak relationship. We consider
 that A is one of the sources of the B’s influence.
 Such situation is quite common in Sina Weibo. For instance,
 a famous user A may not public posts by himself, but repost

 a specified user B’s posts frequently. A’s broadcast amplifies
 the propagation range of B’s information. B’s influence score
 can also be boosted by A’s support. Therefore, we consider A
 is one of the sources of user B’s influence. There also exists
 some artificially constructed linkage structure which can be
 used for boosting some specified vertices’ influence ranking
 score. Study of these issues will help to detect the linkage
 web spam sites, or improve the ranking algorithms or search
 results.
 3) Problem Statement: We consider follow, repost and
 comment to identify the most k influential users in Sina Weibo
 dataset and trace the sources of influence to analyze why a
 particular influential user is important.
 III. MEASURING SOCIAL INFLUENCE
 A. Correlation among Operations
 As mentioned before, since most existing works are based
 on Twitter, the comment-only operation has not been consid-
 ered before. Two questions need to be answered first. Question
 1: Is the comment-only operation important to measure influ-
 ence on Sina Weibo? Question 2: Can the comment operation
 be replaced by existing operations(follow and repost)?
 Question 1 considers the importance of the comment-only
 operation in Sina Weibo. If only a few users use the comment-
 only operation, it may only have a small impact on Sina
 Weibo, which means there are no major differences between
 Sina Weibo and Twitter. Question 2 tries to understand the
 effect of the comment-only operation on Sina Weibo. If there
 is a strong correlation between comment and repost/follow,
 it would indicate that the effect of the comment operation is
 similar to the repost or follow operations under the influence
 measurement so the comment operation is no longer needed.
 First, we answer Question 1. We randomly collect 1132
 posts on Sina Weibo and calculate how many people use
 these three operations related to each post. Figure 3 shows
 the Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) of the three
 operations on Sina Weibo. P (i) is the percentage of the special
 behaviours i on a message. The definition of P (i) is as follows:
 P (i) = Number(i)
 Number(R ? C) + Number(C) + Number(R) ,
 (1)
 where i is the operations, and i ? {R ? C, C, R}, C the
 comment-only operation, R the repost-only operation, and

 Fig. 4. The CDF of Jaccard Similarity Coefficient Between Repost and
 Comment
 R?C the repost-and-comment operation. According to Figure
 3, we find that repost-only and comment-only operations
 are common in Sina Weibo, and repost-only operations are
 more popular than comment-only operations. However, most
 of the users do not use repost and comment operations at
 the same time. In conclusion, the comment-only operation is
 quite common in Sina Weibo. Since Twitter does not have
 the comment-only operation, there is a big difference between
 Sina Weibo and Twitter.
 Then, we answer Question 2. We analyze the correlation
 between repost and comment, because Twitter does not dis-
 tinguish between these two operations. Its “Reply” function is
 a combination of the “Repost” and “Comment” functions.
 When user u publishes a post d, and user v has commented
 on the post d, c(v, d) = 1, otherwise, c(v, d) = 0. When user
 u publishes a post d, and the user v has reposted the post d,
 r(v, d) = 1, otherwise, r(v, d) = 0.
 We adopt the Jaccard Similarity Coefficient to calculate the
 correlation between repost and comment. The formulation is
 shown below:
 J(d) = ∑
 v?V?u
 c(v, d)r(v, d)
 c(v, d) + r(v, d)? c(v, d)r(v, d) , (2)
 where
 ∑
 v?V?u c(v, d) is the number of users who commented
 on the message d,
 ∑
 v?V?u r(v, d) is the number of users who
 reposted on the message d and
 ∑
 v?V?u c(v, d)r(v, d) is the
 number of users who commented and reposted on the message
 d at the same time. Comments and reposts tend to be irrelevant
 when J(d) is small, 0 ≤ J(d) ≤ 1.
 Figure 4 shows the CDF of the Jaccard Similarity Co-
 efficient between repost and comment, and the correlation
 coefficient between comment and repost is low. For most
 of the message Jaccard Cofficient is less than 0.4, which
 means repost and comments are independent of each other,
 and cannot replace one another.
 B. Single-Dimension Influence Measurement
 WeiboRank algorithm consists of two parts: The single-
 dimension influential measurement and identifying influential
 people via Skyline. The first part is based on PageRank-
 like, which evaluates the influence score under a single-
 dimension and the second part extends the first part into
 multiple dimensions.
 The Weibo network contains four elements G =
 ?V, E, F, A? , where V is the set of users. v a particular

 TABLE I
 AN EXAMPLE OF AUTHORITY RANK IN A SOCIAL NETWORK
 Weibo user, F = ?follow, repost, comment? the three types
 of operations. E is the directed edge set. e = ?v, u? ? E, if
 and only if there exists the above operations between v and u,
 that is f(u, v) = 1,f ? F . The edge is directed from user v to
 u, if user v reposts a post from user u. The edge is directed
 from user u to v, if user v has a comment on the post of
 user u. A : V ? R is the influence measurement function
 which maps the node set to the set of real numbers. Since
 we consider that, the same Weibo user can reflect different
 aspects of social influence depending on the angles it is viewed
 from. We choose Af (v) which represents the influence value
 of user v under the f dimension which can be follow, repost
 and comment dimensions.
 Definition 1 (Top-k Queries): Finding k persons that have
 the highest overall scores.
 Af is the influence measurement function and in our work
 we choose PageRank-like as Af . The formulation of single-
 dimension influence measurement in Sina Weibo is shown as
 follows:
 Af (u) =  +
 ∑
 v?M(u)
 Af (v)
 L(v) , (3)
 where  is the constant to ensure that the result is not negative.
 Where M(u) = {v|?u, v? ? E} represents the neighbour of
 user v, and L(v) means the number of outlinks which user
 v has. In Sina Weibo, L(v) presents the number of received
 posts. We randomly assign a score value to each node in the
 graph, and then apply the above equation (3) iteratively until
 the influence scores converge.
 C. Identifying Influential People via Skyline
 The above subsection introduces a single-dimension influ-
 ence measurement through the PageRank-like method. In this
 subsection, we describe how to combine a multi-dimension
 result together to return the final result. Some existed works
 depend on one dimension such as follower or retweet to
 evaluate influential users [1]–[6]. Another previous work [7]
 which considers two dimensions, but they cannot decide a
 reasonable weight in their work. In our work, we choose R-tree
 as the data structure, which can organize multi-dimensional
 data by representing the data by a minimum bounding box.
 And based on the Skyline method to combine the three-
 dimension: follow, repost and comment and to avoid any
 dimension weight decision. The definition of Skyline is shown
 below:
 Definition 2 (Domination): For two vertices u, v ? V , u
 dominates v, denoted by u  v, if ?f ? F , Af (u) ≥ Af (u),
 and not all the three equalities hold.
 Definition 3 (Skyband): In the Weibo network G = ?V, E?,
 a vertex v ? V is a m-skyline vertex if there exists no other
 m vertices u ? V such that u  v.
 m-skyband [10] computation is a kind of query, which
 returns all m-skyband vertices.
 IV. TRACING THE SOURCE OF INFLUENCE
 The previous section describes how to evaluate a user’s
 influence and in this section we analyze why a particular user
 is influential. We also propose a new concept “dependence”
 to trace the source of the influence.
 In Figure 5, h represents the induced subgraph of
 G(Figure 5) by voiding the links connecting to a. In order
 to analyze the dependency of a vertex, we separate the vertex
 from the network by disconnecting its links instead of deleting
 it. In Table I, the first row shows the PageRank-like scores
 of vertices in graph G. AG(v) is the influence measurement
 score of v in G. Gv represents the induced subgraph of G by
 separating vertex v. Apparently, if a, b or c are separated from
 G, e’s pagerank-like score does not change a lot. However,
 if f , g or h are separated from G, e’s pagerank-like score
 changes to greater than 50%, even f and g are not connected
 to e directly. Intuitively, for a vertex v, if a substructure is
 separated from the original network, and v’s authority changes
 a lot, v can be regarded closely dependant on this substructure.
 Definition 4 (Dependency): Given a four-tuple set G =
 ?V, E, F, A? and an individual u, v ? G(V ), we define the
 dependence dep(u ? v) from u to v as:
 dep(u ? v) = log A(v, G)A(v, Gu) . (4)
 dep(u ? v) shows the ratio of the importance of v and
 the original score when graph G is disconnected from u. Gu
 denotes the induced subgraph of G\u, and A(v, G) denotes the
 importance value of an individual v in network G. A : V ?
 R+, when dep(u ? v) = 0, A(v, Gu) = A(v, G), hence
 u ? v does not have dependence; when dep(u ? v) > 0, the
 dependence is positive, otherwise, it is negative.
 For an individual u, if removing a part of the network
 significantly affects the importance of v, we say v is highly
 dependent on that part, and this dependence can be considered
 to be a standard of the analysis of why a particular user
 is important. We can also analyze the relationship between
 nodes; the higher the dependence, the closer the relationship,
 and vice versa.

 V. EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
 In this section, we evaluate, WeiboRank using the real Sina
 Weibo dataset. We collected the Sina Weibo data through the
 API provided by Sina Weibo for preparing work. The Sina
 company provides about 20% of the most reliable data avail-
 able in China. Our work chooses a subset of a full Sina Weibo
 dataset, which includes 22,514,394 users, whom 4,387,532
 users published at least one post from April 15, 2011 to
 July 15, 2011. As for the repost and comment network, we
 obtained all the reposts and comments in the three months and
 found 22,620,281 records. We also analyzed the dependence
 result and evaluated the efficiency of the WeiboRank which
 is implemented using Java. The test environment is shown in

 TEST ENVIRONMENT
 A. The Results of WeiboRank
 Table III shows the top 10 users in Sina Weibo under the
 different dimensions. First three columns present the top 10
 influential people through the single-dimension measurement
 in follow, repost and comment dimensions, respectively. The
 influence evaluation in the first three columns are not only
 based on the number of followers, reposts or comments, but
 also based on the graph structure. The integration column
 presents the results of WeiboRank. Since the comment-only
 operation is an unique feature in Sina Weibo comparing with
 Twitter, the result of comment column can help WeiboRank to
 find some new influential users which are ignored by previous
 works. Hence the WeiboRank will not miss the best influenced
 users in each dimension. For example, the top one user in
 follow dimension is ID=1087770692 (the ID in bold text in
 the first column of Table III), who is a famous actor in China
 and the number of his followers is more than thirty million.
 Moreover, the user whose ID=1266321801 ranks fourth in
 first column, who is also a famous actress in China. She
 has the largest number of follower in Sina Weibo (more than
 forty million followers). However, we find that most of her
 followers are normal users and there are large number of her
 followers even do not write posts any more. Therefore, the
 user whose ID=1087770692 has a higher influence rank than
 ID=1266321801, because the top one user’s followers is more
 active or more influential than the forth user’s. Repost dimen-
 sion has the similar result which based on the repost operation.
 Hence we do not present the details on the repost column.
 The user whose ID=1195230310 is the top influential user in
 the comment dimension, who is a well-know entertainment
 presenter. He is very active in Sina Weibo, because he always
 writes posts or has communications between other celebrities.
 Therefore, the number of his comments is always very large
 which about half of his posts have more than five thousands
 comments and some of his posts have ten or thirty thousand
 comments. Although, 1195230310’s influence is not large
 enough in follow or repost dimension, we mine he in comment
 dimension. In the integration column, we generate the final
 result in previous three dimensions through WeiboRank. The
 experiment shows that we can find the influential users based
 on existed dimensions: follow and repost. Furthermore, the
 WeiboRank also mines the undervalue influential user after
 we consider the comment dimension.

 THE RESULTS OF INFLUENCE RANK ON THE OPERATION NETWORKS
 B. Dependence Analysis
 We choose two famous users, user A and user B, in
 Sina Weibo to analyze their dependence rank under a repost
 network. As shown in Figure 7, there are a few particular users
 have a very high dependence scores compared to user B, which
 means a strong relationship exists among a few particular users
 to user B . If we break the connections between user B and
 these important and influential source users, the influence of
 user B will decrease a lot. However, user A as shown in Figure
 6 is not affected a lot under the same circumstances.
 Figure 8 and 9 present the dependence results under repost
 and comment dimensions and each node represents a Sina
 Weibo user. We find that some users who have high repost
 ranks may have a low comment dependence score, which
 means even for the same user, the dependent users have
 different dependence ranks under different dimensions.
 Figure 10 and Figure 11 show that a set of users who have
 the same comment dependence score has a large rang of repost
 dependence score. It verifies again that, repost and comment
 have weak correlations and different operations cannot replace
 each other.
 C. Efficiency of Algorithm
 To validate the efficiency and scalability of WeiboRank,
 we use several subsets with different numbers of users in a
 high-dimension environment, where d=1 means WeiboRank
 runs in the follower network, d=2 means WeiboRank runs in
 the follower and repost networks, and d=3 means WeiboRank
 runs in follower, repost and comment network. The results are
 shown in Figure 12. We find that, with the increasing data size,
 the running time of the algorithm also increases linearly. The
 calculation time of each subset is proportional to dimension d.
 The larger the value of d, the larger the dominated space we
 need to search, and thus the longer the runtime. Based on the
 above analysis, the algorithm is effective and scaleable, which
 is suitable for large scale networks and parallel processing.
 VI. CONCLUSION
 This work studies the influence of online social network
 services from two aspects. First we proposed a novel method
 called WeiboRank based on PageRank-like and Skyline to
 evaluate influential users, on a novel dataset, Sina Weibo.
 Then we traced the source of influence under three-operation
 networks: follow, repost and comment. We also compared the
 differences between Sina Weibo and Twitter through quantita-
 tive analysis to prove that existing Twitter work does not relate

 to Sina Weibo. Experimental results show that our method
 can find the most influential users among previous influence
 evaluation methods by considering all available aspects. How
 to use dependence analysis to find the “retweet-buying” case
 will be researched more deeply and we will extend our work
 to the topic level in the future.
