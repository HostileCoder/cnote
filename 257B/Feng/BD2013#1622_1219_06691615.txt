 AbstractÑDocument clustering plays an important role in
 large scale textual data analysis, which generally faces with great
 challenge of the high dimensional textual data. One remedy
 is to learn the high-level sparse representation by the sparse
 coding techniques. In contrast to traditional Gaussian noise-
 based sparse coding methods, in this paper, we employ a Poisson
 distribution model to represent the word-count frequency feature
 of a text for sparse coding. Moreover, a novel sparse-constrained
 Poisson regression algorithm is proposed to solve the induced
 optimization problem. Different from previous Poisson regression
 with the family of -regularization to enhance the sparse
 solution, we introduce a sparsity ratio measure which make use of
 both -norm and -norm on the learned weight. An important
 advantage of the sparsity ratio is that it bounded in the range of
 0 and 1. This makes it easy to set for practical applications. To
 further make the algorithm trackable for the high dimensional
 textual data, a projected gradient descent algorithm is proposed
 to solve the regression problem. Extensive experiments have been
 conducted to show that our proposed approach can achieve
 effective representation for document clustering compared with
 state-of-the-art regression methods.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 During past decade, an explosive growth of text contents
 on Internet makes Web documents become a kind of typical
 ÒBig DataÓ and brings both opportunities and challenges
 for knowledge discovery, text mining and information re-
 trieval. Among these techniques, document clustering plays
 very important role in automatic document organization, topic
 extraction and fast information retrieval or filtering [2], [3],
 [26]. Typically, text data is represented as a high dimensional
 binary or count Òbag-of-wordsÓ vector that brings a great
 challenge to document clustering. Sparse coding is able to
 provide a solution by using the unlabeled data to learn a high-
 level sparse representation of the raw inputs for document
 clustering [18], [20]. Lots of previous studies have addressed
 the efficacy of such method in image classification [22], [25].
 For a typical sparse coding problem, the feature values
 are often assumed to be real, which can be described by a
 Gaussian noise model. Moreover, Gaussian model is mainly
 designed for continuous data that could take fractional, or neg-
 ative values [18]. Such assumption is apparently inappropriate
 for the word-counts data [5], [6], especially, the textual data.
 To address this problem, in this paper, we employ a Poisson
 distribution model on the sparse coding for the frequency data.
 More specifically, we consider the problem of learning the low
 frequency count data in the high-dimensional setting. The main
 challenge of sparse Poisson coding for text clustering is how
 to effectively model the nonnegative data while selecting the
 salient features for the succinct model interpretation. Although
 this problem has been explored in the literature, there still exist
 some limitations. For web applications [4], Poisson regression
 is parallelized and implemented under the Hadoop MapReduce
 framework to provide a scalable and efficient solution for
 behavioral targeting. The feature selection scheme is quite
 heuristic, where the important features are selected based
 on the frequency counted in cookie and the most frequent
 entities are selected by a predefined threshold. This method
 may ignore some combination features that occur rarely. In
 neuroscience [14], -regularized Poisson regression is pro-
 posed to learn a sparse representation on the neural activity
 data. In medical imaging applications [10], [11], sparsity-
 based penalties following the idea of compressed sensing [8]
 are proposed to seek a sparse Poisson regression model to
 reconstruct the true function of the photon intensity. These
 methods have to specify a regularization parameter to control
 the sparse level of the solution in selecting the important
 features. However, the range of the parameter is relatively large
 and the relationship between the sparsity level of the solution
 and the parameter is not directly evident. The insufficiency of
 previously proposed work motivates our further exploration on
 the sparse Poisson regression models in this work.
 To overcome the above issues, we propose a novel Poisson
 regression model, namely sparsity-constrained Poisson regres-
 sion (SCPR), to build a linear model for the frequency data
 while providing the sparsity solution for the salient feature
 selection.
 We highlight the contributions of our work in the following:
  Firstly, we employ a Poisson distribution model to well
 describe the word-count feature of a text in sparse coding,
 which can provide a high-level feature for document
 clustering.
  Secondly, we induce a sparse prior to Poisson coding
 by adopting a sparsity ratio, which is different from
 previously proposed sparsity constraints [23], [24]. The
 2013 IEEE International Conference on Big Data
 978-1-4799-1293-3/13/$31.00 ©2013 IEEE 512
sparsity ratio is borrowed from the sparseness constraints
 for non-negative matrix factorization (NNMF) [12], [13]
 and utilizes both the -norm and -norm on the weight.
 More importantly, the ratio is bounded in the range of
 0 and 1, which clearly indicates the sparsity level of the
 solution. It is more intuitive and easier to be set in real-
 world applications. Also, we investigate how to utilize
 the sparsity ratio and elaborate different settings for it.
 We therefore propose the SCPR with an equal constraint
 to maintain the learned weight at a desired sparsity level.
  Finally, in order to make SCPR applicable for high
 dimensional text data input, we design a projected gra-
 dient descent algorithm for SCPR. The algorithm is very
 efficient and scales with the average number of non-zero
 elements, which is much less burden than the original
 Poisson regression model counting all features.
 II. POISSON REGRESSION FOR SPARSE CODING
 In this section, we will introduce how to employ Poisson
 regression to solve a sparse coding problem [7], [9], [17], [22],
 [25].
 We first review the typical sparse coding problem. Let
    be the raw input feature vector. Sparse coding aims
 to find a set of basis vectors      and the
 sparse representations/coefficients    with respect to the
 basis for . Moreover, it is typically based on a Gaussian
 noise model:       , where each
 feature is assumed independent and identically distributed,
  is the -th element of  and  is fixed. A sparse
 prior     is assumed to penalize the
 nonzero representations. Given an unlabeled sample , the
 basis vectors and the sparse representations are obtained by
 the MAP optimization problem:
 	

 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
 
 	 (1)
 The above problem can be efficiently solved by the alternative
 minimization over  and  variables [17]. Also, the basis
 vectors can be efficiently selected as the cluster centers by
 running 
-means clustering on all the data samples [15] or
 simply selected by randomly sampling from the data [21].
 Given a fixed ,  can be obtained by solving a regression
 problem by minimizing the objective for both training and the
 new input data samples.
 The probabilistic model for the above problem assumes
 that the input data features are real-valued, which is typi-
 cally described by a Gaussian noise model. Obviously, it is
 inappropriate for the textual data with word-counts frequency
      			, which may be poorly modeled by a
 continuous Gaussian distribution [18]. We try to address this
 problem by introducing the Poisson distribution model in
 sparse coding on the frequency data. Given a text document

 Fig. 1. Illustration of different sparsity levels (0.1, 0.5, and 0.9). At low level
 of sparsity (left), the weight is dense. At high level (right), most of elements
 are zeros and only a few take large values.
 , we use the following Poisson distribution model:
    Poisson
 
 
  
 
  

 (2)
 where  is the -th element of  and
 
  
  is
 simply denoted as . As each feature is assumed to
 be independent and identically distributed,   
  Poisson. Note that we assume both the basis
 vector and the new representation vector  to be non-negative,
 which imposes a positive effect onto one-unit change in the
 word count for the expected target word count [4]. Given an
 unlabeled sample  and the fixed basis vectors , the sparse
 representations  can be obtained by the MLE optimization
 problem:

 The above log-likelihood is a concave function on  and
 therefore guarantees the global optimal solution for Poisson
 regression. Various algorithms, e.g., gradient descent, can be
 adopted to seek its optimal solution. The derivative of the log-

 III. SPARSE POISSON CODING
 In this section, we consider how to utilize the sparsity
 prior in sparse coding problem. Then we propose an effective
 sparsity-constrained Poisson regression (SCPR) approach with
 a given sparsity level. To solve this problem, we design an
 efficient algorithm based on the projected gradient descent and
 sketch its average computational cost.
 A. Sparse Poisson Regression
 A sparse prior  is assumed to penalize the nonzero
 representations. Then, the sparse representations  are obtained
 513
by the MAP optimization problem:
 	

 
 	 Pen (6)
 where 	 is the log-likelihood. Pen is based on the sparse
 prior, which can be -regularization  [14] or the hybrid
 Huber penalty [10], [11].
 B. Sparsity Ratio
 Numerous measures can be used to evaluate for the sparsity
 level of the coefficients. A good indicator function can map
 a vector from  to   and quantify how much energy
 maintain on the component of the coefficient. An ideal one is
 to have only one non-zero element for the sparse vector and
 with all elements non-zero for the least sparse case.
 Hence, we adopt the sparsity ratio defined in [13] for NNMF
 in this paper:
 spr  
  
 
  
 
 	 (7)
 In Eq. (7), the defined sparsity ratio is different from the
 previously proposed sparse Poisson regression mainly utilizing
 the  regularization. Based on the relationship between the 
 norm and the  norm. Moreover, this ratio contains a good
 property, bounding in the range of 0 and 1. We summarize
 this property of the sparsity ratio in the following proposition:
 Proposition III.1.   ,   , we have
   spr  	 (8)
 The above proposition can be proved by the following
 relationships:
 
 
     	 (9)
 The first inequality follows the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality.
 The second inequality is obvious when putting square on both
 sides. Although Proposition III.1 is valid for negative , we
 still keep the non-negative condition. This is mainly due to that
 we only consider non-negative coefficient vectors. In Eq. (9),
 the lower bound is reached when a vector with equal non-zero
 elements. On the other hand, the upper bound is obtained when
 a vector with all but one vanishing elements. Hence, this ratio
 is intuitive and easy to set the sparsity level of a given vector
 , see more illustrated examples in Fig. 1.
 C. Proposed Model
 We consider how to employ the above defined sparsity ratio
 to obtain the sparse solution. An intuitive setting is to bound
 the sparsity ratio as follows:
 spr  	 (10)
 An advantage of this setting is to maintain the convexity of
 the domain. This can be shown that the domain of the learned
 coefficient in Eq. (10) is equivalent to
   
 	
 
 where
 	 
 
    	 (11)
 This is exactly a second-order cone, or Lorentz cone [1].
 Combining the restriction of   , i.e.,   , we can
 define the domain of learned coefficient in a convex set. Fig. 2
 shows the different examples.
 (a) 
 (b) 
	 (c) 


 Fig. 2. Illustration of the set of the learned weight bounded on different
 levels (0.1, 0.5, and 0.9). The larger the bounded sparsity ratio, the larger the
 domain of learned weight is.
 It seems that we can define the learned coefficient by
 bounding the sparsity ratio as in Eq. (10) and yield a convex
 optimization problem. As illustrated in Fig. 2, a large bound,
 i.e., spr  , the defined domain of the learned coefficient
 will recover the whole domain of the learned coefficient, which
 is exactly the original domain of Poisson regression. Moreover,
 defining  on the conic set in Eq. (10) also cannot yield sparse
 solution.
 Hence, we borrow the idea of the sparsity constraints pro-
 posed for NNMF in [13] and propose the sparsity-constrained
 Poisson regression (SCPR) as follows:
 
 
 	 s.t. spr  	 (12)
 Note that our proposed SCPR requires the learned coefficient
 at a certain sparsity level via the pre-defined parameter . For
 the different sparsity levels, we can refer to the charts shown in
 Fig. 3. It can be found that the larger spr, the smaller valid
 set is. Extremely, the set consists of several isolated points on
 the corresponding axis, when the sparsity ratio is set to one.

 for different sparsity levels (0.1, 0.5, and 0.9). The set consists of the mesh
 except the green region. The set becomes small as the sparsity ratio increases.
 D. Algorithms
 In order to make our proposed SCPR applicable for the
 high-dimensional textual data, we design an efficient projected
 gradient descent algorithm for the minimization problem in
 SCPR. The whole algorithm consists of two main steps: 1) the
 first step mainly follows the Òmultiplicative update ruleÓ as in
 Eq. (5) to update the coefficient vector; 2) the second step is to

 project the coefficient onto the constraint space to achieve the
 desired level of sparsity. This procedure is summarized into
 Algorithm 1.
 In Algorithm 1, the function Projection(, , ) has
 to be called several times, which is to project  with the
 corresponding -norm and the square of -norm to achieve
 the desired sparsity. The procedure is defined in Algorithm 2.
 For Algorithm 2, we first remove those elements with the
 value being zero at line 2. At line 3, a point on a hyperplane
  
 
   is initialized. Then, we move from the center
 of the sphere towards the initialized point to satisfy the 
 constraint, where the center is defined by the point with all
 elements being equal in the updated index. If the updated point
 is non-negative for all the elements, and then the algorithm is
 terminated. Otherwise, we reset those elements with negative
 values to zero, and project the point back onto the hyperplane
 with
 
  
 
  .
 Time complexity analysis. Comparing to the original Pois-
 son regression model, the proposed SCPR requires invoking
 the function Projection at each iteration, which incurs some
 computation efforts. In the worst case, Algorithm 2 may take
 as many iterations as the number of coefficients dimension,
 i.e., dim, to converge to an optimal solution. However, the
 algorithm converges much faster in practice. It just needs about
 four iterations for the worse case and one or two iterations for
 the optimal solution at average.
 Hence, the number of iterations in the function Projection
 can be considered as a constant. Moreover, the computation
 cost for the function Projection is proportional to the number
 of non-zero elements (NNZs) in the learned coefficient. Addi-
 tionally, the number of outer iterations required by Algorithm 1
 is much smaller than the original Poisson regression model due
 to the sparse solution.
 In summary, Poisson regression has to update the coefficient
 for all elements due to non-sparsity. The number of outer
 iterations is proportional to the dimension of the raw features
 and the number of coefficient dimension. We abstract it as
   and obtain the time cost of PR as  . SCPR
 requires   outer iterations, which is nearly a constant, and
 several times to invoking the function Projection. At for each
 iteration, SCPR only needs to update those non-zero elements.
 Hence, the average run time cost for SCPR is in the order
 of   AvgNNZs, which is much smaller than the
 original Poisson regression model.
 IV. EXPERIMENTS
 To study the efficacy and the merits of our proposed
 SCPR method in different perspectives, we evaluate the doc-
 ument clustering performance using the different regression
 approaches in sparse coding for learning the coefficients. All
 the experiments are conducted on a notebook computer with
 Inter i3-3110M CPU@2.40GHz and 4GB memory.
 A. Sparse Coding for Document Clustering
 In this section, we evaluate the performance of sparse
 coding for document clustering. To show the efficacy of our
 algorithm, we study the Poisson regression approaches with
 different sparse prior and regularization.
 1) Dataset: We conduct the performance evaluations on
 the TDT2 document corpora [3], which consists of the data
 collected during the first half of   and taken from six
 sources, including two newswires (APW and NYT), two radio
 programs (VOA and PRI) and two television programs (CNN
 and ABC). It is composed of   on-topic documents
 which are classified into  semantic categories. In this exper-
 iment, those documents appearing in two or more categories
 were removed, and only the largest  categories were kept,
 515
thus leaving us with   documents in total1. In the dataset,
 the stop words are removed and each document is represented
 as a  -dimensional TF-IDF vector.
 2) Evaluation Measure: In our experiments, the basis for
 sparse coding is firstly selected by randomly sampling from
 the data [21]. The raw feature of each document is fed into
 the different regularized regression approaches in order to
 obtain the sparse representations, which are further employ
 to cluster the documents. The clustering result is evaluated
 by comparing the estimated label for each document using
 
-means clustering algorithm. Two typical metrics are used
 to measure the performance. The first metric is the accuracy
 (AC) [2]. Given a document , let  and  be the estimated
 cluster label and the label provided by the corpus, respectively.
 The AC is defined as follows:
  
 
   
 
  (13)
 where  is the total number of documents.   ! is the delta
 function, and  is the permutation mapping function
 that maps each cluster label  to the equivalent label from
 the data corpus. The best mapping can be found by using the
 Kuhn-Munkres algorithm [19].
 Another metric is the normalized mutual information (NMI)
 metric [2]. Let  denote as the set of ground truth clusters and
  as the cluster set obtained from clustering algorithm. The
 mutual information metric "  is defined as follows:
 "   
  
 #   
 # 
 #  #  (14)
 where # # are the probabilities that a document ar-
 bitrarily selected from the corpus belongs to the clusters 
 and  , respectively. #  is the joint probability that the
 arbitrarily selected document belongs to the cluster  as well
 as  at the same time. We further employ the normalized
 mutual information (NMI):
 "   " 
 $ $   (15)
 where $ $  are the entropies of  and , respectively.
 From the definition, we know "  ranges from  to
 . If two sets of clusters are identical, " is equal to one.
 If they are independent, " is set to zero.
 3) Performance Evaluation: We compare our proposed
 SCPR algorithm with several algorithms: Gaussian regression
  norm regularizer (GR-), the original Poisson regres-
 sion without sparse prior (PR), Poisson regression with 
 norm regularizer (PR-), Poisson regression with Recursive
 Dyadic Partitions (RDPs) regularizer (PR-RDP), Poisson re-
 gression with translationally-invariant (cycle-spun) RDPs (PR-
 TI), Poisson regression with Total Variation semi-norm regu-
 larizer (PR-TV). To facilitate the fair comparisons, we directly
 adopt the implementation of these reference methods with the
 1http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/dengcai/Data/TextData.html
 recommended settings [10]. In our experiments, the dictionary
 size is set to    and   , respectively. In each
 case, the sparsity level  is set to 	 and 	, respectively,
 according to the cross-validation.
 Fig. 4 plots the clustering results. Table I reports the coding
 time when   . It can be easily found that our pre-
 sented SCPR approach obtains better clustering performance
 compared with other methods. This is because our algorithm
 not only reduces the reconstruction error but also captures the
 same basis for the similar documents using a fitted sparsity
 level. Though RDPs and RDP-TI constraints can greatly
 improve the regression speed, their performances decrease at
 the same time. Except from these two fast regression methods,
 other approaches with the sparsity prior show better perfor-
 mance than the raw regression and the Poisson regression-
 based sparse coding outperforms the Gaussian regression-
 based sparse coding. This demonstrates that the sparsity prior
 would capture the salient high-level features of the text to
 improve the representation ability and Poisson distribution can
 better describe the word-count feature of the text data. Among
 these effective sparse Poisson coding methods SCPR method
 performs best with the least computation time.
 V. CONCLUSION
 In this paper, we introduced the Poisson distribution model
 to represent the word-count textual feature in sparse coding.
 A novel sparse-constrained Poisson regression algorithm was
 proposed to solve the induced optimization problem. We have
 defined a sparsity ratio which employed both -norm and -
 norm on the learned weight. To further make the algorithm
 applicable for the high dimensional textual data, we designed
 a projected gradient descent algorithm to solve the regression
 problem. We have conducted the regression experiments on the
 synthetic data to show the improvement of our presented SCPR
 algorithm compared with the original Poisson regression. The
 clustering experiment on the high-dimensional textual data
 indicated that our proposed approach is able to learn the better
 sparse representation with faster speed for document clustering
 compared with the state-of-the-art regression methods.
