Keynote Address 
Strategy and the Future of Software Applications 
Dr. Brian Subirana 
Associate Professor, MIT Sloan School of Management 
Abstract 
We will first provide a framework to analyze the evolution of software applications and 
the derived opportunities for market disruption that emerge. We will then apply the 
framework, first to well know success stories and then to the future. Our window into the 
future will be based on recent research mostly from the MIT Field Intelligence 
Laboratory. We will focus on Big Data and various engineering solutions that are 
currently being researched including sensors that enable new applications (light scanning, 
smart skins, water leakage, temperature RFID); architectural solutions that enable new 
data sharing models for applications (such as cloud car, RFID middleware, digital 
graffiti); and the potential disruptive business impact in various business processes and 
industries including the supply chain, massive on-line open courses, smart cities, auto-
 industry and social media.
