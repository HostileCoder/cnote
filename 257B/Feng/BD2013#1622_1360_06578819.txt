 Abstract—Detecting the emergence of a political crisis is a key
 goal of security informatics. Big data provides us with valuable
 information on the many socio-economic indicators of crisis
 dynamics, ranging from unemployment to the trustworthiness of
 political institutions. However, it is currently challenging to link
 information on these factors in order for analysts to assess the
 possible directions of a conflict. At present, while some solutions
 offer theoretical frameworks for understanding those indicators
 in the abstract, these frameworks cannot easily be operationalised
 to the level needed for automatic processing of big data streams.
 Alternative solutions do automatically code political events, but
 only offer a high level picture that cannot support the analysis
 of deeper conflict processes. In this paper, we combine Visual
 Analytics with Concept Maps to support analysts in monitoring
 conflicts. Visual Analytics allows the interactive visual exploration
 of data, while Concept Maps keep this exploration focused
 by linking data patterns (e.g., occurrence and frequency of
 keywords) to underlying dynamics (e.g., coordination of activism,
 salience of violence). We illustrate the potential of our approach
 through a discussion of how it could be used to study the on-going
 Syrian crisis. While this approach still requires validation with
 analysts, we fully specify the technical structure of our approach
 and exemplify its use to detect shifts in political stability.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 For the intelligence and defence community, the prediction
 and mitigation of terrorist threats calls for a nuanced under-
 standing of the dynamics of political crises and conflicts [1],
 [2]. An essential element of this task is to develop deep
 insights into the processes that generate significant transitions
 into violent modes of political action. Doing so, however, is
 challenging due to the downside of big data: ’information
 overload’ and the difficulty of detecting ‘signal within noise’.
 Therefore, intelligence professionals have called for improve-
 ments in information management [2].
 There are currently two types of solutions. First, political
 events may be coded into a system either in a fully automatic
 way [3], [4], [5] or with the assistance of field monitors [6].
 Second, analysts may use refined concept models representing
 dynamics of conflict [7], [8], [9], [10]. The former provides
 analysts with numerous categorized events and an aggregate
 level of threat, but offers limited support in understanding the
 deeper dynamics of these events. The latter can shed light on
 how events may be connected, but is difficult to operate due
 to the interrelatedness and dynamicity of the causes that shape
 conflicts [8], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14].
 A. Contribution of the paper
 Our project aims at developing the foundations for new
 intelligence tools that will allow analysts to interactively
 explore coded events using concept models. This will be
 accomplished by pairing Visual Analytics (VA) with Concept
 Mapping (CM) and is expected to yield three benefits.
 First, we provide a method for exploring ‘big data’ such
 that conflict processes and transitions will be more apparent to
 analysts. VA allows the interactive visual exploration of large
 volumes of heterogeneous data, which supports an analyst in
 connecting the patterns they observe to deeper dynamics in
 the object of study. CM enhances the traditional VA approach
 by structuring the connections between factors, which allows
 an analyst to navigate a large search space in a focused way.
 Second, we contribute to the development of automated
 tools for monitoring conflicts in real-time. Using VA and CM
 on past conflicts enables an analyst to identify specific flags
 in data that inform on conflict dynamics (e.g., changes in pat-
 terns of mobilisation as religious terms becomes politicised).
 Software built upon this knowledge can monitor transitions in
 ongoing conflicts by scanning selected flags in data streams
 coming from sources such as diplomatic and informant reports,
 social media, journalistic media, and official statements.
 Finally, the system designed here can be used to improve
 our theoretical understanding of the processes driving political
 crises. The analyst will tailor the initial CM as new patterns are
 observed or hypothesised connections are found to be absent
 or irrelevant. Analysing data using our VA+CM approach thus
 results in an evidence-based model of the connections between
 social factors for the situation at hand, which can be used to
 update an intelligence picture and inform policy.
 B. Organization of the paper
 Section II provides a summary of how the analyst could
 interact with information and the technical solutions involved.

A practical example is developed in Section III for the conflict
 in Syria, by structuring the salient dynamics of that conflict
 into a concept map and then linking this map to data sources.
 Finally, we discuss how the innovative combination of VA and
 CM can be adapted both to support analysts in understanding
 conflicts, and to perform real-time monitoring.
 II. THE ANALYST’S INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE
 A. Overall architecture
 Developing a systematic understanding of the causal dy-
 namics of conflict is an essential goal in scholarship on the
 subject [14]. By interacting with our proposed system, an
 analyst can use an initial map to start exploring conflict data
 and, as patterns are witnessed, modify the map accordingly.
 The map keeps a history of the patterns considered relevant
 by the analyst and, most importantly, supports the analyst in
 their exploration. It does so by providing a concise graphical
 rendering of the data sliced along two axes: time of the events,
 and level of processes or operating causal mechanisms. Each
 factor in the map - representing the state of a process at a given
 time - has a size and colour that represents its salience to the
 events that occurred during the selected period. This allows
 the analyst to identify different phases in the conflict, since
 salient factors at a given time may become more peripheral
 as shifts occur in the conflict [14]. To best understand these
 shifts, factors must be organized at several levels. Using a soci-
 ological framework, we consider that macro-level phenomena
 are caused by and can be explicated through the aggregations
 of micro-level factors. These micro-level phenomena can be
 inferred from data aggregated from several sources. A multi-
 level causal approach allows the analyst to understand changes
 in higher levels in terms of the activity at lower ones; an
 analyst can select one factor and view how it sits within a
 broader and multi-level array of operating causal mechanisms.
 This interactive experience is summarized in Figure 1.
 Fig. 1. Architecture of the proposed solution. Color online.
 The content of the five planes depicted in Figure 1, from
 top to bottom, is as follows:
  Macrodynamics: macro-level factors that the analyst
 ultimately seeks to explain and predict, such as levels
 of violence or insurgent organization. These are akin
 to indicators of global level of threat as provided by
 FAST [6].
  Microdynamics: processes that are performed by individ-
 uals in a conflict environment, such as a military action
 or organisational development. These are of great interest
 for the analyst who seeks to refine their understanding of
 the link between micro and macro-dynamics.
  Data Patterns: acts as an intermediate between the
 front-end that guides the analyst’s exploration (macro
 and micro dynamics) and the back-end that pools data.
 Patterns of interest which make visible the otherwise
 opaque micro-dynamics, include the frequency of certain
 terms found in social media and summaries of economic
 data such as market prices.
  Data constellation: cluster documents using either top-
 ics or document categories. This allows the analyst to
 understand the type of evidence that supports selected
 processes, which can be particularly useful to detect bias.
  Data sources: relevant sources selected by the analyst, ei-
 ther publicly available (e.g., EMM NewsExplorer, Nexis)
 or provided to the analyst only (e.g., intelligence reports,
 results of crawls on the dark web [15]).
 B. Technical solutions
 Several techniques are used to enable the connections be-
 tween these different planes:
  Fuzzy logic. The factors underlying conflicts, at both the
 micro- and macro-level, can be inherently vague and/or
 uncertain. Therefore, deriving the value of a factor (e.g.,
 protest march) from other ones (e.g., slogan, place names)
 requires a mathematical approach that is able to deal
 with the vagueness of these factors. Fuzzy logic is a
 technique of choice, as “it is designed to mathematically
 represent uncertainty and vagueness, and to provide for-
 malized tools for dealing with imprecision in real-world
 problems” [16]. Examples of how fuzzy logic can build
 and operationalize maps for complex social problems can
 be found in our previous work on conflicts [7].
  Data mining. Quantitative data can be extracted auto-
 matically from standardized web pages (e.g., values of
 stocks and commodities prices to provide economic data)
 and aggregated. However, sophisticated techniques are
 needed when aggregating qualitative data. Specifying a
 list of keywords that should be searched for each data
 pattern is not sufficient because of the ‘vocabulary prob-
 lem’, also known as ‘semantic barrier’: vocabulary differs
 between fields, and the probability that two persons use
 the same term to classify the same object is less than
 20% [17]. Therefore, suggested keywords are expanded
 using thesauri derived from data [17] and using EMM
 NewsExplorer, which provide synonyms for key persons
 201
and places in several languages, allowing for a multi-
 lingual database. The patterns found will be an under-
 estimate of the actual patterns, for example because of
 ‘aggregation conflicts’ [18]: an entity may be explicitly
 mentioned and later implicitly identified (e.g., “Minister
 A. was present”, “all ministers present”).
  Data aggregation. Several software solutions are readily
 available to organize and render document clusters. A
 description of how a typical solution is used can be found
 in [19] for the case of InSpire’s Galaxy view, while details
 of how such solutions are built are provided in [20] via
 the example of InfoSky.
 III. A PRACTICAL EXAMPLE: THE SYRIAN CASE
 A. Background
 One method of understanding the dynamics of conflict
 that is particularly supportive of the goals of the intelligence
 community is to divide a case into significant phases or
 transitions. Doing so allows the analyst to focus on the
 mechanisms or processes that are most salient in driving
 escalations in violence or instability during political crises.
 However, conducting this kind of analysis is made challenging
 by the dilemma of ‘information overload’ and the difficulty
 of detecting ‘signal within noise’. Our innovative pairing of
 Visual Analytics and Concept Maps addresses this challenge,
 illustrated here for the ongoing conflict in Syria.
 B. Phases of conflict
 The conflict in Syria appears to have gone through
 three phase changes. The conflict emerged in March 2011,
 Protestors then gathered to demand the release of teenagers
 recently arrested and tortured for writing a popular slogan
 of the uprisings in Tunisia and Egypt, which called for
 revolution. These protestors did not call for greater democratic
 and personal freedoms and received minor concessions from
 the government [21]. The conflict then escalated as the
 government’s response was to open fire on protestors, leading
 to street protests in other parts of the country, with protestors
 taking an increasingly hostile and hard-line attitude towards
 the regime [22]. Despite continued lethal attempts at repression
 by military and paramilitary units against the largely non-
 violent public street protests of the insurgent movement, the
 government was unable to put an end to the growing pop-
 ular insurrection [23]. By late autumn 2011, protestors were
 universally demanding comprehensive political change and the
 resignation of President Assad [22]. Finally, the militarisation
 occured by early 2012, as insurgents reorganised into guerrilla
 units and activism started to take on a military character, while
 regime repression began to make substantial use of artillery,
 heavy weapons, and indiscriminate punitive attacks upon non-
 combatant populations in ‘opposition’ territory [23].
 C. Designing the Conceptual Map
 Having divided the Syrian case into three conflict phases, we
 now seek to facilitate the detection of transitions between these
 phases. This relies on the joint use of VA and CM, where the
 latter operationalises the processes through which transitions
 are obtained from finer grained or micro-level data. The first
 step in designing a CM is to refine the transitions of interest.
 These are informed by the literature on contentious politics,
 social movements, and insurgency:
  Crisis Emergence occurs when a social movement be-
 gins to develop sufficient support to challenge a govern-
 ment [8], [24]. Examples of crisis emergence indicators
 include the entrance of political elites into a protest
 movement [8], [25] or expressions of dissent [26] and
 mobilisation [27] such as street protests.
  Crisis Escalation is produced by a shift from contained
 contention, where activism occurs through established
 institutional and legal channels, to transgressive con-
 tention where activism involves the use of innovative
 means that violate existing conventions [8]. Examples
 include staging acts of civil disobedience such as ‘sit-
 ins’, vandalism, or confrontations with police [28].
  Crisis Militarisation results from the increased violence
 of transgressive activism and the reorganisation of ac-
 tivist organisations into ‘military’ command and control
 structures. This change into armed action [29], [9], [12]
 is illustrated by the Second Intifada, which very quickly
 shifted from mass protests to guerrilla warfare [30] or
 more recently the ouster of Muammar Qaddafi in Libya,
 where street protesting gave way to civil war.
 While the above provides a valuable understanding of trends
 and processes, it cannot be directly applied to a fine-grained
 study of unfolding events [8], [26], [10]. The CM allows us to
 conduct a deeper analysis of Syria by connecting the salient
 insights found within scholarly literature to patterns in the data
 which otherwise would remain obscure. Following a top-down
 approach (Figure 1), the second step identifies the macro level
 factors. Three factors were identified:
  Salience of violence (S) in interactions between activists
 and government forces. A high S means that most protests
 and confrontations are violent.
  Insurgent radicalness (R) refers to the type of demands
 that have been put forth by activists; a high R means that
 activists demand substantial changes in regime structure
 and leadership.
  Coordination of activism (C) is the level of organisation
 and strategy of the activist groups; a high C means that
 activists are tightly organised and subject to extensive
 command and control.
 These factors have stable arrangements for a given phase
 of the crisis. Therefore, changes in that arrangement can be
 indicative of substantial shifts in the organisational structure
 of insurgent or protest groups and in type of methods used
 by both government forces and activists. Possible values and
 arrangements for a given phase could be as follows:
  Crisis emergence. Protest movements comprise people
 who switch between normal activities and activism. Ac-
 tivism is not highly organised, and consists primarily in
 marches or demonstrations of unity, numbers, righteous-

 ness, and commitment. Demands are not revolutionary,
 as protestors desire limited changes in policy. Salience
 of violence is low, because activists are generally not
 employing violent strategies, and government repression
 is limited to civil policing and containment.
  Crisis escalation. Activists face increasing costs for
 continued protests, leading to greater commitment and
 organisation, as well as the use of violence in both self-
 defence and as a proactive strategy. Protestors begin to
 demand significant shifts in regime structure, severely
 threatening elite interests. Government repression inten-
 sifies, making public protests or civil disobedience a
 dangerous action of limited strategic value.
  Crisis militarisation. With comparatively disorganised
 modes of activism proving increasingly limited in value,
 activists reorganise into paramilitary units.
 It should be noted that the three factors may not increase
 in parallel. The 1979 Iranian revolution provides an example
 of a high salience of violence with relatively low insurgent
 radicalness and coordination of activism, at least until its latest
 stages. An increase in one of the factors relative to the others
 can thus be indicative of a transition.
 Six factors have been retained at the micro-level. The lethal-
 ity of violence and the insurgent military capacity captures the
 particularly violent and militarised nature of the Syrian civil
 war. Combatant mobilisation stands for the capacity of parties
 to attract and field combatants. Claim diffusion represents
 the extent to which insurgent demands have crystallised and
 harmonised into a coherent platform for change. Insurgent
 consolidation takes into account the convergence of insurgents
 organisations towards a single organisational structure. Finally,
 we also capture the insurgent coordination with regards to their
 actions. These factors, together with their connections based
 on the literature on dynamics and mechanisms of conflicts,
 are illustrated in Figure 2. Connections upwards (to macro-
 dynamics) are further clarified by Table I, and connections
 downwards (to data-patterns) are summarized by Table II.
 TABLE I
 RATIONALE FOR THE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN MICRO- AND MACRO-
 DYNAMICS IN FIGURE 2.
 Link Rationale for a link in the Syrian case
 1 The prevalence of extrajudicial executions of various types appears
 highly relevant to the overall construction of conflict narratives both
 domestic and foreign.
 2 The rapid increase in counter-insurgent brutality by the govern-
 ment, along with the insurgent’s own brutal actions, has contributed
 to the intractability of demands.
 3 The extent to which government and rebel forces are able to
 mobilise combatants highly determines the effects of violence.
 4 The ability to mobilise combatants in this case is closely connected
 to the efficacy and breadth of government and rebel organisational
 structures.
 5 The capacity of rebel forces to challenge the Syrian state is highly
 deterministic of the challenge that the insurgent movement poses,
 and the political fallout of its actions.
 6 Rebel military capacity to a large extent will determine how much
 insurgent groups will demand, as higher capacity enables greater
 coercive power.
 7 The consolidation of insurgent groups correlates to increased
 command and control.
 8 Claim diffusion is closely connected with protest organisation and
 media campaigns.
 9 The diffusion of revolutionary messages has contributed to the
 crystallisation of demands.
 Figures 3 and 4 use STARLIGHT Information Visualization
 System to examplify how to visualize the connections from
 data sources to data patterns based on the information in Tables
 I and II; this corresponds to the lower half of our architecture,
 specified in Figure 1. Such visualizations can allow analysts
 to immediately find all documents relevant to a given term or
 data pattern, which is valuable to assess whether sources are
 diverse or there is an over-reliance on a few sources. In our
 architecture, analysts could also select a window of time, and
 see the importance of various terms and data patterns (e.g., via
 the size of bars in Figures 3 and 4). The connection of data
 patterns to micro-dynamics and mechanisms is specified in
 Figure 2, and its operationalization requires the use of Fuzzy
 Logic as detailed in [7].

 IV. DISCUSSION
 In this paper, we raise the relevance of using Visual Ana-
 lytics tools and Concept Maps to help the task of the Analyst
 in identifying societal shifts into insurrection and insurgency.
 To validate this paradigm, we propose to use existing data
 from a known conflict: the Syrian crisis as it escalated into
 civil war. The technique we propose fits well into wider
 ongoing intelligence efforts to improve how political crises
 are predicted, analysed, and conceptualised. First, efforts to
 expand and improve ‘big data’ collection through scanning
 social media will provide higher-quality informational inputs
 for analysis via a method such as ours [31]. Second, using our
 method, analysts can determine which information sources are
 more salient to a conflict at a given time - both type (religious,
 economic, military, etc) and token. This can not only inform
 other intelligence collection targets, but also aid in the use
 of computational methods for selecting targets, for example
 through the increasingly popular use of network analysis [32].
 Third, and perhaps most importantly, our method overlaps in
 both theme thinking with existing projects, such as Lockheed
 Fig. 4. Clicking on a term will highlight all relevant documents as well as
 connected data patterns. Visualization using STARLIGHT. Color online.
 Martin’s ‘Integrated Crisis Early Warning System’ [33] or the
 US Air Force project to develop a ‘social radar’ [34], [35].
 While many aspects of these projects are opaque to foreign
 academics not connected to the US defence community, it is
 very likely that methods such as ours will augment, serve as
 counterpoints to, or creatively aid other projects such as these,
 providing alternative or innovative perspectives on translating
 ‘big data’ into useful insights.
 Concept Maps have a rich history in the creation of static
 models of complex systems [36], and particularly in intel-
 ligence research [37], [38]. They are also the first step in
 creating simulations that will generate synthetic data, such
 as System Dynamics or Fuzzy Cognitive Maps [7]. Despite
 shared roots in visualization and information management,
 Concept maps have only recently entered the sphere of Visual
 Analytics [39]. In this paper, we presented a visually interac-
 tive framework that combines the two approaches to face the
 challenges raised by the increased relevance and availability of
 real-world data. In this framework, Concept Maps support the
 analyst in the process of extracting knowledge from big data.
 Practically, maps structure the relationships between different
 factors deemed key to the analyst; this provides a valuable
 focus in terms of identifying key data sources and finding
 connected factors. Visual Analytics then allows analysts to
 conveniently and interactively explore data, which may lead
 to validating of refining the concept maps. Successive changes
 in the maps provide a path of analysis, which may then benefit
 new phases of exploration as data is continuously acquired.
 The benefits of using concept maps for visual analytics are
 similar to that brought by the Unified Modelling Language
 (UML) for software design. UML can help structure complex
 projects, and can be used to automate a portion of the coding.
 Concepts Maps also bring structure to data by formalizing
 204
the relationships between factors. Consequently, it will be
 important during the implementation phase to take an Agile
 approach and regularly assess how our framework can best
 automate a portion of the knowledge discovery process. This
 faces numerous challenges, particularly as big data does not
 equate good data and cleaning is essential [40]. However,
 automation will be key to the design of tomorrow’s Situational
 Awareness Systems, which have to detect and predict to an
 increasingly accurate extent the particular conditions leading
 to events of interests, such as political unrest.
 V. CONCLUSION
 Using Visual Analytics to explore big data prior and during
 conflicts can be used to create, refine and validate a complete,
 multi-level Concept Map that will highlight the main drivers of
 conflicts. This innovative combining of readily available visual
 analytics tools with interactive Concept Maps can contribute to
 building the fundamentals that will allow for the development
 of algorithms that automatically detect and anticipate shifts
 into political unrest.
