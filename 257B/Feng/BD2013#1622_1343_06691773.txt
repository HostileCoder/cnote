 Abstract—Data obtained from New York City’s Taxi & Limou-
 sine Commission highlights the importance of yellow cabs in
 the city’s transportation infrastructure. In 2011, for example,
 there were nearly 180 million cab rides. In this paper, we
 provide detailed visualizations of these numerous journeys. Using
 a random sample, we also develop several relevant economic
 metrics. For example, we find that nearly half of all rides were
 taken by a single passenger traveling short distances. In contrast,
 out-of-pocket costs faced by passengers averaged less than $6
 per mile, with 90% paying less than $8 per mile, even when the
 social value of the city’s roads is highest. From a city planner’s
 perspective, the current fare structure for yellow cabs may not
 be optimal. Finally, we propose a statistical method to analyze
 dynamic flow patterns of yellow-cab rides that can ultimately be
 extended to a multivariate model.
 I. INTRODUCTION
 In Manhattan, yellow taxicabs (cabs) seem ubiquitous.
 They appear in almost all of the numerous movies filmed
 in New York City (NYC), and an award-winning situation
 comedy was devoted to the cabbie profession. In NYC, the
 Taxi & Limousine Commission (TLC) licenses all yellow cabs
 through a medallion system, which allows it to regulate fares
 and standards. TLC reports that there were 13,237 licensed yel-
 low cabs on NYC’s roads in 2011.1 Each yellow cab typically
 operates on a shift schedule with two or more different drivers
 per day, which permits a single cab to be in near-continuous
 daily operation.
 Data were obtained from the TLC on all yellow cab rides in
 2009, 2011, and 2012. The focus of this study is 2011, during
 which there were nearly 180 million yellow cab rides. When
 a cab picks up passengers curb side, its meter records detailed
 information about the journey that is ultimately relayed to
 the TLC. This information includes the time, longitude, and
 latitude of the pick-up and drop-off location, as well as the
 number of passengers, the fare (including tolls and taxes), the
 tip (if a credit card is used), as well as a trip’s (piecewise
 linear) distance and duration.
 We have developed animated visualizations and summary
 statistics of these journeys to demonstrate the important role
 that yellow cabs play in NYC’s transportation infrastructure.
 We examine the spatial and temporal characteristics of these
 journeys. We also develop useful economic metrics to examine
 whether, from a planning perspective, the current fare sched-
 ule is optimal. Finally, we propose a statistical approach to
 examine the dynamic patterns of yellow cab journeys.

 II. RELATED WORK
 There is a considerable academic literature on transporta-
 tion economics, and a comprehensive literature review is
 outside of the scope of this workshop paper. In brief, as with
 other areas of economics, transportation economics deals with
 the allocation of scarce resources in a transportation network.
 People and goods flow through transportation networks at cer-
 tain speeds along defined paths, and a single trip may involve
 the use of multiple modes of transportation. Modeling the
 demand for transportation amounts to the thought experiment
 of an individual making a choice among a set of discrete
 and finite alternatives. An individual will choose the option
 that yields the highest benefit. Not surprisingly, this modeling
 approach is called discrete choice theory, the econometrics
 of which was developed and advanced by economist Daniel
 McFadden. More information can be found in [1].
 Regarding the analysis of taxi data, several efforts have
 been done in recommendation systems [2]–[4], modeling [5]–
 [8], and visual analytics [9], [10]. Only [10], however,
 examined yellow cab data for NYC, focusing on visual ex-
 ploratory tasks. In this paper, we look at the data from a
 hypothetical policy planner’s perspective using various metrics
 to begin to understand better the role yellow cabs play in
 NYC’s transportation infrastructure. The visualizations here
 supplement those in [10].
 III. MILLIONS OF JOURNEYS
 A. One Day in the Life of a Yellow Cab
 There were nearly 180 million yellow cab journeys
 throughout NYC in 2011. With only about 13,000 yellow
 cabs on the road, this implies that each cab is making nearly
 14,000 journeys each year. Figure 1 maps out a day in the
 life of a single yellow cab. On April 30th, 2011, this yellow
 cab made curb-side pickups of 58 total passengers who paid
 $650 in total fares. In Figure 1(a), hired trips from the yellow
 cab are highlighted in red. Because our data does not include
 GPS tracking for each trip, we constructed plausible routes
 by utilizing fastest paths based on speed limits. Figure 1(b)
 shows a similar visualization but also includes journeys when
 the taxi is roaming free without a passenger. Hired trips were
 marked with blue lines, while empty trips were marked with
 red lines. This combined visualization expresses how much
 time and distance a taxi spent looking for passengers compared
 to fare-generating time and distance. Animations are available

 B. Spatial and Temporal Characteristics
 For each curb-side pick up and drop off, a cab’s meter
 records the time in seconds elapsed since January 1, 1970 and
 the location in longitude and latitude. Longitudes and latitudes
 can be mapped to any level of geographic aggregation, and
 we have geocoded this information to the neighborhood map
 used by the TLC.4 This neighborhood map would likely be
 recognized by any New Yorker.
 For our analysis, we generated a simple random one-in-
 24 sample of the all of the 2011 cab rides. While future
 extensions will examine all of the data obtained from the TLC,
 the results presented here are unbiased summary statistics. We
 have eliminated the limited number of journeys that begin or
 end in the Bronx, Staten Island, or any of the three regional
 airports (JFK, LaGuardia, and Newark). We also eliminated
 journeys of exceedingly long duration (60 minutes) or distance
 (60 miles), as well as journeys that record no passengers.
 Finally, we aggregated all locations in Brooklyn and Queens
 to those respective boroughs, as well as a limited number
 of locations in Manhattan into a category we call “Other in
 Manhattan” or “OIM”.
 The first observation we note is that almost all yellow
 cab rides begin and end in Manhattan, making it an obvious
 focus for this workshop paper. Within Manhattan, a large
 number of cab rides begin and end in Midtown (MID), the
 Upper East Side (UES), or the Upper West Side (UWS).
 This concentration of journeys is hardly surprising. First,

 3http://vgc.poly.edu/files/hvo/cab hired empty.mp4
 4http://www.nyc.gov/html/tlc/downloads/pdf/passenger info map.pdf
 population densities in the UES and UWS exceed 40,000
 persons per square kilometer, more than double the highest
 population densities in either Brooklyn or Queens.5 Only the
 East Village has a population density that approaches this
 magnitude. Second, there is a considerable concentration of
 business establishments in MID.6
 Figure 2 displays a histogram of pick up locations (based
 on the geocoding discussed above). For those neighborhoods
 not already discussed, the legend is: BR is Brooklyn; CH is
 Chelsea; EV is East Village; FD is Financial District; GD is
 Garment District; GR is Gramercy; GV is Greenwich Village;
 HK is Hell’s Kitchen; LES is Lower East Side; QN is Queens;
 SO is Soho; and WV is West Village. Fewer than 3% of rides
 begin in either Brooklyn or Queens. Nearly 40% of rides begin
 in MID, UES, or UWS. Note that MID contains Grand Central
 Terminal, but does not include Pennsylvania Station, which is
 located in CH (based on the TLC map). Nearly 7.5% of rides
 begin in CH.
 Figure 3 displays a histogram of drop off locations using
 the same naming convention. The results are largely consistent
 with those seen in Figure 2 with two main exceptions. The
 share of cab rides that end in either Brooklyn or Queens
 (regardless of their origin) rises markedly. The share of rides
 that end in Queens rises to 2.24%, while that in Brooklyn
 rises to 3.31%. Again, we will address this point in greater
 detail in the section on dynamic modeling, but a bit of New
 York fokelore appears wrong. Cabs do go to Brooklyn (and
 Queens)–they just do so infrequently.
 We now examine the temporal characteristics of yellow cab
 rides. Figure 4 displays a histogram of cab rides by month,

while Figure 5 and 6 display them by day of week and by
 time of day (24-hour clock), respectively.
 Yellow cab rides are fairly uniform throughout the year.
 (We have confirmed that 2011 is consistent with other years.)
 They reach a slight peak in March and a slight trough in
 August. In January 2011, the average air temperature at JFK
 Airport was about 30?F.7 Peak temperatures were not reached
 until July and August, with averages of 79?F and 75?F respec-
 tively. Those months also recorded maximum temperatures that
 exceed 90?F. As a result, it appears that yellow cab rides are
 largely invariant to temperature. We continue to explore the
 role of rainfall, but we do not believe that general weather
 conditions are a strong driver of cab rides (so to speak).
 In 2011, nearly 51 million tourists visited NYC.8 We are
 exploring whether seasonal variation in tourist patterns help to
 explain the monthly variation seen in Figure 4. We think this
 implausible largely because tourism in NYC typically peaks
 in July and August.
 Turning to daily characteristics, Figure 5, in contrast with
 Figure 4, shows a clear pattern. The distribution of yellow cab
 rides rises steadily throughout the work week. About 12.5%
 of rides occurs on Sunday, which is lower than one would
 expect if journeys were uniform over the week (indicated
 by the horizontal line). This share rises by 2.5 points to
 its Friday peak. In terms of the total daily trips taken, this
 difference amounts to approximately 12,000 yellow cab rides.
 Again, the temporal pattern here is clear: yellow cab rides are
 concentrated late in the week, with nearly one-third of all cab
 rides taken on Friday and Saturday.
 Figure 6 displays a histogram of journeys by hour, which
 demonstrates the most temporal variability. The share of jour-
 neys declines steadily from midnight to 5AM. As the morning
 rush hour begins at 6AM, however, the volume of journeys
 rises markedly. This level is largely sustained throughout the
 day, albeit with a small dip at 4PM, which may be associated
 with the shift change in yellow cab drivers. Journey volume
 again ramps up with the evening rush hour, which TLC defines
 to be 4 to 6PM. Peak volume, however, is reached at 7PM,
 declining steadily thereafter, only to resume the cycle. The
 sustained volume throughout the day, together with a 7PM
 peak, suggests that the current TLC definition of rush hours
 may not be optimal.
 C. Journey Characteristics
 We now turn to importance characteristics of yellow cab
 journeys in NYC, particularly in Manhattan. There is a striking
 but simple characterization: a single passenger, slowly travel-
 ing a short distance. (This bit of New York fokelore is correct.)
 Figure 7 displays a histogram of the number of passengers
 for a given ride. Figure 8 displays a kernel density plot (or
 probability density function) of the distance in miles of a given
 journey.
 From Figure 7, we find that nearly 70% of yellow cab
 journeys are occupied by a single passenger. This share spikes
 between 6 to 8AM, hours the TLC designates to be morning
 rush hour. During these hours, nearly 80% of journeys are

 Distribution of Drop Off Location
 Fig. 3. Distribution of drop off location
 occupied by only a single passenger (another fact that suggests
 variability is not driven by tourism). The high share of single
 passengers implies that, on a daily basis, cabs carry far
 fewer than one million passengers. In contrast, New York’s
 Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) reports that, in 2011,
 NYC’s subway system carried nearly 4.5 million passengers
 per day, while MTA buses running throughout NYC carried
 over 1.8 million passengers.9
 Figure 8 displays a density plot of the distance of cab
 rides, omitting the density beyond 10 miles. (Note that this
 is a probability density function, not a cumulative density
 function from which one could readily read percentiles.) The
 mode of the distribution falls almost exactly at one mile.
 The average distance is 2.1 miles, and slightly over 70% of
 journeys are 2.5 miles or less. Simply put, this is a highly
 skewed but important characterization. Yellow cab journeys
 are overwhelmingly short distance.
 Figure 9 displays a density plot of the average speed
 in miles per hours (MPH) for a cab journey. Recall that a
 yellow cab meter measures piecewise linear distance, which
 is not necessarily the same thing as the distance between
 two locations. (For example, a yellow cab traveling one mile
 east along 42nd Street and turning north on 8th Avenue to

 Distance (Miles)

 travel one mile would record a journey of two miles. In
 linear distance, these two locations are only 1.4 miles apart.)
 The speed limit throughout NYC is 30MPH, unless otherwise
 posted.10 Figure 9 shows a modal speed of about 10MPH. On
 average, yellow cabs move at about 12MPH, while about 76%
 of journeys move at 15MPH or slower, half the posted speed
 limit throughout NYC.
 There is another way to examine this characteristic, which
 is the time in minutes necessary to travel one mile or time
 per mile. Figure 10 displays a density plot of time per mile.
 The modal value is about four minutes to travel one mile. The
 average is 5.9 minutes with about a quarter of the journeys
 requiring at least seven minutes to travel one mile. A pedestrian
 walking “briskly” would take about 15 minutes to walk one
 mile. In other words, the typical single passenger who is
 traveling a short distance is doing so slowly.
 D. A City Planner’s Perspective
 An extended discussion of public economics and external-
 ities is outside of the scope of this workshop paper. Any intro-
 ductory textbook on public economics addresses the topic at
 length. For example, Rosen and Gayer define an externality as

 occuring “when the activity of one entity affects the welfare of
 another in a way that is outside the market. Unlike effects that
 are transmitted through market prices, externalities adversely
 affect economic efficiency.” [11] Conceptually, an externality
 drives a wedge between the value or cost of goods to an
 individual and the value or cost of goods to a group or society,
 which gives rise to the economic inefficiency. Externalities
 often arise with public goods, such as roads. For example, in
 transport economics, road congestion is a negative externality.
 We see such congestion when we examine time per mile at
 5PM. Figure 11 displays the same density plot as Figure 10, but
 limited to those journeys that commence between 5 and 6PM.
 The entire density shifts to the right, meaning it takes longer
 to travel one mile at 5PM than it does for the day as a whole.
 The average time to travel one mile rises by nearly 10%. Based
 the density plots, one should note that this increase is occuring
 for all trips at this time as the density has shifted right in its
 entirety. Some famous New Yorkers have complained about
 yellow cab drivers changing their shifts around 5PM, when
 “the number of active taxicabs on the streets falls by nearly
 20 percent comapred with an hour before.”11 Having fewer
 yellow cabs on the road at this time, while an inconvenience

 Time per Mile (Minutes) at 5PM
 Fig. 11. Density plot of time per mile at 5PM
 for a former NYC mayor and his law partner, likely reduces
 traffic congestion when the social value of NYC’s roadways
 is its highest. This is particularly true when one considers the
 array of transportation alternatives available in NYC.
 An obvious question arises at this point: what are (largely-
 single) passengers paying to go short distances slowly? Yellow
 cab pricing is a two part tariff: a fixed (or flat) fee of $3.00
 ($2.50 entry and $0.50 MTA tax) and a variable fee of $0.50
 for each additional “unit,” where a unit is determined by a
 combination of speed and distance. An additional dollar is
 added to the fixed fee on weekdays between 4 and 8PM, as
 are any bridge or tunnel tolls.12 We calculate the total cost
 of a journey faced by passengers: the sum of fare, taxes, and
 tolls. We exclude the tip from this calculation as this amount
 is chosen by the passenger rather than being a fee schedule
 faced by the passenger.13 We then normalize this amount by
 the total distance of the journey to obtain the passenger cost
 per mile.
 Figure 12 displays the density plot of the cost per mile
 overall and between 5 and 6PM. Both density plots have
 pronounced modes at about $5, which is more pronounced
 at 5PM. Both plots have several “spikes” that are associated
 with mass points in total costs induced by tolls. Passengers
 are paying $5.26 on average to travel one mile, which rises by
 about 5% to $5.51 per mile for journeys between 5 and 6PM.
 While both densities are somewhat skewed, 90% of journeys
 cost a passenger $7.77 or less per mile overall and $8.08 or
 less per mile between 5 and 6PM.
 To date, we have found no solid statistics on the value to
 New Yorkers of a mile of their roadways. Nevertheless, it is
 certainly true that this value rises, perhaps markedly, during
 morning and evening rush hours. On the other hand, yellow
 cabs cannot carry the passanger volume for given amount of
 roadway space relative to, say, MTA buses. In 2011, the base
 fare for a single ride on local MTA buses was $2.25. The base
 fare for interborough express buses, which cover distances well
 in excess of one mile, was $5.50. We note that the average

 IV. DYNAMIC TRANSITIONS
 The visualizations in Figure 1 and discussion above present
 an obvious method of analysis: given a cab ride begins in a
 particular location, what is the likelihood that it ends in the
 same or some other location? If such dynamic transitions do
 not depend the next to last journey, we call such likelihoods a
 first-order Markov process. For example, if the likelihood a cab
 goes from Midtown to the Upper East Side does not depend
 on the fact that it previously picked up and dropped off in
 the Upper West Side, then the process can be called a first-
 order Markov. (Given the structure of these data, it is trivial
 to use higher-order Markov processes. For our purposes here,
 the first-order approach is satisfactory.) The use of Markov
 processes has become widespread in dynamic stochastic mod-
 eling. For example, its use is ubiquitous in macroeconomics
 (dynamic stochastic general equilibrium), finance (dynamic
 asset pricing), and areas of microeconomics (dynamic pro-
 gramming).
 Formally, a Markov process {Xt} is a stochastic process
 with the property that, given the outcome of Xt, the outcomes
 of Xs for s > t are unaffected by the outcomes of Xu for
 u < t. (Our discussion of Markov processes is deliberately
 brief. For a thorough treatment, see [12].) The probability
 that outcome j is observed this period, given outcome i was
 observed last period, is called a one-step transition probability,
 customarily denoted Pij .
 P{Xt = j|Xt?1 = it?1, Xt?2 = it?2, . . .}
 = P{Xt = j|Xt?1 = it?1}?t (1)
 If the one-step transition probabilities are stationary, they
 can be arrayed into a square matrix with a dimension that is
 determined by the number of possible (and finite) outcomes.
 For example, if there are J possible outcomes, the transition
 probability matrix has dimension J ? J with elements that
 determine the probability of transitioning from the row out-
 come to the column outcome. Naturally, a row sum is equal
 to 1. A Markov process is completely defined by its transition
 probability matrix and some initial starting condition, X0. For
 a complete application of this statistical approach to dynamic
 land use, see [13].
 Using the neighborhood location discussed above, our
 Markov transition probability matrix would be 16 ? 16 with
 on-diagonal elements capturing the likelihood that a yellow
 cab ride began and ended in the same neighborhood. We refer
 to these probabilities as “unconditional” as they are simply the
 observed outcomes. Figure 13 displays the Markov transition
 matrix.
 We find several salient features of these unconditional
 probabilities. For example, the probability a cab ride begins
 and ends in Brooklyn is 52%, while that for Queens is 60%.
 (Recall we have excluded journeys to and from airports.)
 Consider that if these Markov states were represented with
 a 16-sided die, the probability of any outcome on a roll
 would be 6.25%. Therefore, these two intra-location transition
 probabilities are extraordinarily large. None of the other 14
 on-diagonal transition probabilities are nearly as large. This
 suggests that particular yellow cab drivers may “specialize” in
 intra-neighborhood journeys, a subject that we are currently
 exploring. We also find that the on-diagonal elements are 13%
 for Chelsea, 12% for Gramercy, 22% for Midtown, 32% for
 the Upper East Side, and 31% for the Upper West Side. These
 findings reinforce the point that yellow cab journeys are short
 distance. In contrast, a journey starting in Soho is likely to end
 anywhere else, including Soho, almost uniformly.
 For future iterations of this work, we are developing a
 multivariate Markov model that will allow us condition the
 transition probabilities on a number of independent covariates
 from other data sources. For example, information from the
 U.S. Census allows us to compute population density (which
 normalizes the differences in land area), as well as concen-
 trations of business establishments. We will also be able to
 include information on weather conditions by hour in NYC,
 which will provide a time-varying determinant that is common
 to all yellow cab journeys. Ultimately, we intend to develop
 a simulation model, based on the transition probabilities, to
 examine whether and how the distribution of journeys would
 be affected by alternative fare structures and tolls.
 V. CONCLUSION
 The visualizations in this paper highlight the important role
 that yellow cabs play in NYC’s transportation infrastructure.
 As shown, however, this role typically appears to be limited
 to picking up a single passenger and transporting her slowly
 over a short distance. The out-of-pocket cost she should expect
 to pay is less $6 per mile, and almost certainly less than
 $8 per mile, even when the social value of the city’s roads
 is highest. Given the richness of these data, we propose a
 statistical method to analyze dynamic flow patterns of taxi
 rides that can ultimately be extended to a multivariate model.
