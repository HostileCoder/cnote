Abstract— There is a growing understanding that privacy is 
an essential component of security. In order to decrease the 
probability of having data breaches, the design of information 
systems, processes and architectures should incorporate 
considerations related to both privacy and security. This 
incorporation may benefit from the offering of appropriate 
training. In this way, this paper intends to discuss how to better 
offer training while considering new developments that involve 
both multimedia production and the “gamification” of training. 
The paper suggests the use in conjunction of two frameworks: the 
EduPMO Framework, useful for the management of large scale 
projects that may involve a consortium of organizations 
developing multimedia for the offering of training, and the Game 
Development Framework, useful for the identification of the 
main components of the serious game for training on privacy by 
design to be developed as part of the training offering.  
Keywords—big data; privacy; security; training. 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
Research on cyber security training is relevant to 
applications related to the protection of local. national, 
international, and global assets as well as for security in 
cyberspace. One of the main reasons is the need to train all 
stakeholders from an organization on cyber security, from the 
chief information officer to the end user. There are different 
training needs according to the profile of each stakeholder, 
which may drive the development of content in media like 
audios, videos, texts, hypertexts, animations, simulations, 
serious games, and so on. The offering of training in complex 
courses like the ones on security may demand the creation of a 
consortium of organizations that may have to work in 
collaboration to develop the content and even to teach it. 
Considering that security is an international concern, there is a 
tendency that more and more national and international 
consortiums will be formed, which brings additional 
complexity to the task.  
While discussing the creation of the National Cybersecurity 
Center of Excellence (NCCoE), a public-private collaboration 
(PPC) for accelerating the widespread adoption of integrated 
cyber security tools and technologies, Jackson [14] suggests 
that "there is no lack of commercially available tools to counter 
rapidly evolving cyber threats, but putting them into place and 
having them work together efficiently can be a challenge". The 
author mentions different demands that may benefit from good 
quality training, like the difficulty to use available tools and the 
fact that many solutions are not widely known. 
The importance of security in the cyber world is growing in 
a way that new specialty areas with the cyber security field are 
being created and consolidated. As an example, according to 
the National Cyber Security Workforce Framework [12], the 
typical duties and skill requirements of cyber security workers 
involve 31 common types of cyber security tasks. Many 
competencies, or areas of expertise, are required for successful 
performance of these tasks by each specific role: Knowledge 
Management; Legal, Government, and Jurisprudence; Logical 
Systems Design; Mathematical Reasoning; Modeling and 
Simulation; Multimedia Technologies; Network Management; 
Personnel Safety and Security; Project Management; 
Requirements Analysis; Risk Management; Software Testing 
and Evaluation; and others. The many competencies that are 
required suggests part of the training needs.  
The cyber security field may be analyzed in many different 
perspectives. One of these perspectives is the one related to 
privacy. Privacy may be understood as freedom from 
unauthorized intrusion. With the increase in the use of 
informatics by citizens of all nations, privacy turned to be an 
essential element to be considered for financial transactions, for 
medical information exchange and so on. As an example, while 
people want to buy items on the web, they don't want their 
credit card numbers to be shown to unauthorized people. In 
another example, while they want doctors to save all their

health history in databases, they don't want these databases to 
be easily accessed by intruders.  
In the last few years, a new approach that considers the 
Personal Data Ecosystem, or PDE [7], turned to be of increased 
relevance: "The challenge we face is protecting and promoting 
individual privacy while at the same time allowing for the 
socio-economic opportunities and benefits derived from the 
permissioned contextual use of our personal information". In 
the so called “age of big data”, new ways of using data may 
bring innovation but the protection of personal data is essential 
to guarantee the rights of individuals [13].   
In this research, the training needs related to both privacy 
by design and security by design are considered in the 
perspective that these two paradigms are both converging and 
complementary [6].  
This work will take into consideration new developments 
for training. These developments involve both multimedia 
production and the “gamification” of training. For this purpose, 
the paper suggests the use in conjunction of two frameworks. 
The first framework is useful for the management of large scale 
projects that may involve a consortium of organizations 
developing multimedia for the offering of training. The second 
framework, on the other hand, is useful for the identification of 
the main components of the serious game to be developed.  
This paper is organized as follows. After this introduction, 
the second section presents important concepts related to 
privacy and security by design in the cyberspace.  
The third section presents in detail the first framework, 
which is useful for large scale multimedia production and for 
management of training. This framework has been applied by 
the authors in real projects [3]. The fourth section presents 
briefly the second framework and focuses on the 
“gamification” of training as a new approach. 
The fifth section presents trends, future work and the 
conclusion of the paper.   
II. PRIVACY AND SECURITY BY DESIGN IN CYBERSPACE 
The next paragraphs present relevant concepts related to 
privacy and security by design in the cyber world. According 
to the Swedish Data Inspection Board [8], the operator who has 
control over the handling of personal data is always responsible 
for following the legislation of the EU data protection directive 
95/45/EC [9]. This includes ensuring that IT systems, used in 
business, do not lead to privacy risks. Therefore, clear 
requirements for suppliers who deliver IT systems, and for the 
organization themselves, must be considered while 
mechanisms and routines to minimize privacy risks must be 
implemented. Even if organizations not always develop or 
purchase IT systems, but instead use other services for their 
purposes (cloud services, outsourcing, etc.), the responsibility 
is always with the organizations and they must ensure that the 
supplier meets the requirements for security and privacy [8].  
There are four main areas that need attention: 1) 
minimizing the amount of personal data, 2) limiting access to 
the personal data, 3) protecting personal data, and 4) letting the 
system guide the user in the right direction [8][11]. By 
considering privacy issues from start to end during the 
system’s life cycle, the ability to comply with applicable laws 
and to improve security can be increased. Simultaneously, the 
risk of unnecessary costs and time-consuming work, which 
easily arises when one has to deal with the problems 
afterwards, can be reduced [11].  
Our earlier research shows that socio-critical systems like, 
for instance, healthcare, have significant shortcomings in 
limiting access control, protecting personal data and ability to 
guide the user in the right direction in the healthcare systems, 
concerning privacy aspects [1][2]. Many factors can be the 
cause for this situation. However, results show clearly that 
knowledge and skills are missing about the need for including 
privacy aspects already in the early phases of systems 
development. Healthcare is an important area for society. 
Therefore, there is a need to focus on skills-enhancing security 
measures generally, in order to protect patient information as 
well as to include necessary security measures in the form of 
training and competences for privacy reasons [1][2][6]. 
III. LARGE SCALE MULTIMEDIA PRODUCTION AND THE 
MANAGEMENT OF TRAINING 
In this section, a framework that benefits from the concept 
of “multimedia factory” will be presented and discussed. 
Greenfield [10] defines a software factory as a “development 
environment configured to support the rapid development of a 
specific type of application”. As this author proposes, software 
factories promise to change the characteristics of the software 
industry by introducing “patterns” of industrialization. In the 
same way, a “multimedia factory” would be a development 
environment configured to support the rapid production of 
different types of digital media, which may include audio, 
video, software or hypertext, among others. While a mature 
software factory would intend to have high levels of code 
reuse, a mature digital “multimedia factory” would intend to 
reuse as many parts of products as possible. As a tendency, 
future may present increasing cases of systematic family-based 
product development, with product line practices getting better 
understood both in the software industry and in the educational 
digital multimedia industry.  
The following paragraphs present a framework for the 
management of projects on educational multimedia production 
while considering the use of the multimedia products on 
training projects. The framework is named EduPMO [3], an 
abbreviation of “Educational Project Management Office”. It 
has three components: the model, the methodology and the 
implementation. The components should be understood as 
related but independent entities.  
In such a model, the dimensions are divided in two 
categories: implicit and explicit. The explicit dimensions are 
directly expressed, in total or in part, to the different people 
participating on projects. The implicit dimensions, on the other 
hand, still affect the work of the teams, but they are not directly 
expressed to them since these dimensions represent a set of 
strategies used by the managers and the educational project 
management office to manage projects. Despite the obvious 
interrelationship between the dimensions, they were divided 
into four explicit dimensions and five implicit dimensions in 
140
order to facilitate the understanding and the use of the 
processes involved.    
The explicit dimensions go from D1 to D4, as follows. The 
first dimension, or D1, is the content dimension, and refers to 
the appropriate understanding of the fundamental project 
requirements involved, in particular in terms of the content to 
be considered on multimedia production and/or use. The 
second dimension, or D2, is the pedagogical dimension, and 
refers to the teaching and learning aspects involved. The third 
dimension, or D3, is the technological dimension, and refers 
mainly to the processes related to the technical requirements of 
products to be produced and/or used. The fourth dimension, or 
D4, is the management dimension, and refers to knowledge 
areas known as project integration, project scope, project time, 
project cost, project quality, project human resource, project 
communications, project risk and project procurement.  
The implicit dimensions go from D5 to D9, as follows. The 
fifth dimension, or D5, is the strategic dimension, and refers to 
meeting the specific strategic objectives through the centralized 
management of several portfolios and programs, which may 
include identification, prioritization, authorization, 
management and control of the projects. The sixth dimension, 
or D6, is the knowledge dimension, and refers to essential 
aspects to favor an effective management of knowledge, like 
harvesting, selection, configuration, dissemination and 
application. The seventh dimension, or D7, is the change 
dimension, and usually refers to the management of transitions 
related to the project itself or in the way in which the teams 
work. The eighth dimension, or D8, is the maturity dimension, 
and refers to process improvement. The ninth dimension, or 
D9, is the rights dimension, and refers to aspects involving 
innovation management and intellectual property.  
For each dimension, guidelines focused on multimedia 
production and/or use may be presented for the processes, in a 
way that six artifacts would be available to managers and/or to 
the management team for each process: (1) description; (2) 
diagram; (3) inputs; (4) outputs; (5) tools and techniques; and 
(6) template documents. In general, the processes would be 
generic but the template documents would be specific to the 
type of project under consideration.  
The methodology from the framework refers to the 
implementation of the model and has three phases per cycle: 
(1) “D”, or Design phase; (2) “I”, or Implementation phase; 
and (3) “A”, or Assessment phase. The methodology may be 
applied for one or more projects of the organization. The 
design phase should consider the context of the project in order 
to determine what is possible to be implemented in the short, 
medium and long terms. After the design, the implementation 
phase will implement the short term plan and then assess the 
results in order to bring about elements for the next D-I-A 
cycle.   
The first phase, “D”, or Design, would have the following 
fundamental activities: (i) identification by the educational 
project management office of the methodology components to 
be implemented in the organization while considering the 
context of the moment, which may include the definition of the 
relevant dimensions and the development of glossaries, guides, 
etc., as a way to define standards and practices; (ii) plan the life 
cycle processes, an activity that entails defining the useful 
processes for each dimension, with description, diagram, 
inputs, outputs, template documents, tools and techniques to be 
used; (iii) select the platform that will facilitate the 
methodology implementation; (iv) if needed, elaborate a formal 
written document detailing the management office operation 
during the specified cycle, with objectives, cost, scope, 
schedule, etc.             
The second phase, “I”, or Implementation, would have the 
following fundamental activities: (i) training of the project 
manager by the management office; (ii) plan in detail of the 
transition (change) in the way of working in order to improve 
the management of the project under consideration; (iii) 
training of the project team by the project manager or by the 
management office, in this way facilitating the transition 
(change) in the way of working in order to improve the 
management of the project under consideration; and (iv) 
execution, which may include actions going from starting the 
use of new software to the implementation of a series of 
processes of a specific dimension.      
The third phase, “A”, or Assessment, would have the 
following fundamental activities: (i) assess the implementation 
while considering the detailed planning of the transition 
(change) in the way of working in order to improve the 
management of the project under consideration; (ii) suggest 
possible actions for the next D-I-A cycle in the specific project 
being considered; (iii) search for improvement opportunities on 
the methodology based on the assessment of the 
implementation; and (iv) suggest possible reviews on the life 
cycle processes, which implies on possible reviews on 
descriptions, diagrams, inputs, outputs, template documents, 
tools and techniques.  
In this perspective, the D-I-A cycle will be used 
continuously as a way to allow the improvement of the 
methodology based on the different assessments happening in 
each project. In parallel, different cycles could happen in the 
same project in the perspective of improving its management 
during its execution. As a consequence, the improvements tend 
to happen more often and according to a planned schedule. 
This context tends to favor the use of contributions from both 
the managers and the teams with the potential to affect the 
organization as a whole. In the proposed framework, there are 
199 processes in the nine dimensions [3].    
IV. THE “GAMIFICATION” OF TRAINING AS A NEW 
APPROACH 
After a brief discussion related to the “gamification” of 
training, this section presents a framework useful for the 
development of a serious game for training on privacy by 
design. The framework presented here may be used in 
conjunction with the EduPMO framework that was presented 
in the last section.  
In a recent report on the educational value of serious games 
[4], research on the effect and effectiveness of serious games is 
summarized in an analysis of 99 scientific articles published in 
journals over the last 10 years. The report shows that serious 
games and game based learning seem to be useful to almost all 
subjects, a fact that suggests its applicability to the kind of 
141
training discussed in this work. Moreover, the report concludes 
that "if they are not always superior to other types of learning 
material, the evidence that serious games can be effective 
learning materials in their own right is quite strong". 
A “gamefied” training may be presented in different ways. 
One of these ways involves using frameworks, as we present in 
the next paragraphs. The Game Development Framework [5] 
may be useful for the identification of the main components of 
the serious game to be developed as part of the training under 
consideration. The framework assumes that “playing a game 
can be described as making changes in quantitative game 
states, where each specific state is a collection of all values of 
all game elements and the relationships between them”. This 
framework divides the game components into four categories: 
holistic, boundary, temporal and structural.  
Initially, for the holistic category in the framework, the 
proposed serious game discussed in this paper would have the 
following components: game instance, game session, play 
session and extra-game activities. Secondly, for the boundary 
category in the framework, the proposed serious game 
discussed in this paper would have the following components: 
rules, modes of play, goals and subgoals. Thirdly, for the 
temporal category in the framework, the proposed serious 
game discussed in this paper would have the following 
components: actions, events, closures and subclosures, end 
conditions and evaluation functions. At last, for the structural 
category in the framework, the proposed serious game 
discussed in this paper would have the following components: 
interface, game elements, players, game facilitator and game 
time.  
The next steps in this research will focus on detailing the 
game components suggested by the Game Development 
Framework [5], which is a generic one. Eventually, after 
presentation of appropriate justifications, only the aspects of 
the framework that are relevant will be considered. 
V. CONCLUSION  
This work involved two relevant trends perceived by the 
authors: (1) the growing importance of privacy and security in 
the cyberspace and (2) the “gamification” of training. While 
“big data” may benefit the society in many ways, privacy and 
security in the cyberspace cannot be neglected. And while 
training may be based on traditional media like videos and 
books, “gamification” must be investigated as a new approach 
with many potential positive benefits.  This research may be 
considered relevant to the protection of assets in the cyberspace 
if the very specific demands of training here discussed are 
considered. The appropriate use of computers and other 
devices tends to depend more and more on training due to the 
increased complexity of IT.  
Future work may focus on describing and validating a 
serious game for training on privacy by design. The fact that 
international networks like the Internet are omnipresent 
suggests that new research should consider a global perspective 
on training.
