I.  INTRODUCTION 
Cloud computing is the birth of the new term in the third 
quarter of 2007. After only half a year, its attention degree 
exceeds grid computing and has been high up to now. The 
relationship of cloud computing and grid looks just like one 
of TCP/IP and OSI on Internet.  Cloud computing is a 
business model. The calculating task is distributed in large 
computer resource pool, so that all applications can access 
computing power, storage space and information service 
according to its demand. We may think that cloud computing 
is the development of parallel computing, distributed 
computing and grid computing or commercial 
implementations of these computing science concepts. 
Elastic Computing Cloud in Amazon Company, Google GFS 
distributed file system and MapReduce distributed 
computing technology with their open source 
implementation : Apache Hadoop,  IBM Blue cloud 
computing platform and Windows Azure will turn to be the 
most influential cloud computing platform and in wide 
application[1][2][3]. And cloud computing will be widely 
applied in the fields such as earthquake monitoring, 
astronomical information processing DNA information 
analysis, medical image processing and so on in the future[4]. 
With the rapid progress of medical imageology, these 
advanced techniques and equipments such as 320-slice spiral 
CT, ultra-high field MRI, molecular imaging, functional 
imaging, multi-modality imaging fusion have brought 
convenience to doctors. As the major clinical and therapeutic 
effect diagnostic tool of the world’s high incidence diseases 
such as cancer, these devices have resulted in a large number 
of medical image data. The sharing of regional medical 
resources and coordination of medical process through 
network functioned as a remarkable means of overcoming 
the difficulty of medical treatment and expensive medical 
expense. Regional medical imaging coordination was an 
significant part of regional healthcare and the establishment 
of regional imaging services platform could benefit tele-
 radiology, virtual radiology department, remote teaching, 
remote redundancy, personal medical record hosting, typical 
case query, content-based imaging retrieval, etc., which was 
of great importance for the balance of medical recourses, 
improvement of diagnosis accuracy in basic medical 
institutes and lower medical costs [5] [6].  
In the recent IBM “Global Outlook” report proposes the 
influence to the future five years technical development 
direction, with particular reference to the vertical service 
areas. For example, in the study of global “medical reform” 
topic, it may involves a very high cost and as the user ( the 
patient) to access the service quality is not high, and the 
inside of the service agencies, like doctors and insurance 
companies also did not get what they want in the service, the 
entire circulatory system efficiency low. Future application 
of the model is to create a new generation of medical 
transformation system, cloud computing is one of the 
important methods of delivery. To find a suitable method 
and model is to analysis these data, then physicians and 
patients will be recommended and provided with the better 
treatment project[7] [8].  
Combined with the analysis above, the paper gives the 
preliminary design of the overall technical framework of 
regional medical image cloud services platform based on the 
data center of Fujian Province Tumour Hospital, China. The 
rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II presents 
the development and clinical application problems of 
medical imaging. Section III designs the overall technical 
framework of regional medical image cloud services 
platform, including the logical architecture, network 
architecture, storage architecture and software architecture. 
Section IV prospects the future research work about medical 
image file data intensive application.   
II. SUMMARY ON CLOUD COMPUTING 
Cloud computing is the development of parallel 
computing, distributed computing and grid computing and 
commercial implementations of these computer science 
concepts. Cloud computing has the features such as large

scale, virtualization, high reliability, generality, high 
scalability, on-demand service and extremely cheap. Cloud 
computing is also the hybrid evolution and growth results of 
virtualization, Utility computing, IaaS (Infrastructure as a 
Service), PaaS (Platform as a Service), SaaS (Software as a 
Service) and other concepts. At the present the most success 
examples are EC2 (Elastic Computing Cloud) and S3 
(Simple Storage Service) in Amazon Company, Google 
search engine based on distributed in more than 30 sites, 
with more than 2 millions servers in the cloud computing 
infrastructure support, IBM “blue” cloud computing platform 
to bring customers to buy namely use namely, Microsoft 
Windows Azure operating system: “blue sky,” China Ali 
cloud and so on.  
The technology system architecture of Cloud computing 
is consisted of four parts of SOA layer, management 
middleware, pool of researches and physical researches.  The 
SOA layer is encapsulating layer of Cloud computing power 
into the standard Web Services and integrated into the SOA 
system, consisting of the specific service interfaces, service 
registration, service discovery, service access and service 
workflow. Management middleware is consisted of user 
management, task management, resource management and 
security management. Its function is scheduling a lot of 
application task in order to make the resources provide with 
efficient and safe application services. Resource pool is 
consists of computing resource pool, storage resource pool, 
cyber resource pool, data resource pool and software 
resource pool. Resource pool will be substantially the same 
type of resource structure isomorphism or nearly isomorphic 
resource pool.  
Grid computing is collaborative sharing resources and 
solving with the problem in a dynamic, many agencies 
involved in virtual organizations. By comparing with Grid 
computing as shown in Tab. 1, Cloud computing is well-
 known by us. Cloud computing will have resources into 
small pieces. These resources are shared and used by same 
agencies. Cloud computing is easy to achieve and use by 
boss in the same unit. The relationship of Cloud computing 
and Grid computing is like one of TCP/IP and OSI. Cloud 
computing is a simplified form of grid computing. Grid is 
not only integrating heterogeneous resources but also solving 
with many technical problems coordination. Unlike cloud 
computing has a successful business model to promote, grid 
computing is very difficult to calculate and realize. But for 
many high-end scientific and military applications, cloud 
computing is unable to meet the demand, must rely on the 
grid to solve. Such as electricity and water resources to 
provide with people services, cloud computing may solve 
with computing power and storage space on the shared use. 
Compared with 3G, Mobile internet and Internet of things, 
cloud computing will provide with all the user high quality 
service. Cloud computing will be applied in scientific 
computing, medical processing, network safety, image 
processing and so on. Combined with medical reform in 
China, the medical cloud computing architecture have been 
proposed on the report  of China Cloud computing 
application strategic research (2012) of the CCID (China 
Center for Information Industry Development) Limited by 
Ltd.

 III. THE CLINICAL APPLICATION PROBLEM OF MEDICAL 
IMAGING 
The eighty last century, medical information industry 
started and experienced the three phases of starts? local 
application starts and the comprehensive construction in 
China, now which is going toward intelligent perception 
stage. Through construction of more than 20 years, in the 
field of public health, the basic epidemic reporting has been 
achieved in the country at the county level and above the 
county level medical institutions. The two class information 
platform of country and province has been constructed in a 
public health emergency command decision-making system 
and other aspects, which carried out disease control, health 
supervision, maternal and child health care, blood 
management information system in the city bodies. More 
than 90% of the county level and above hospitals have 
established the registration fees, medicines and equipment, 
medical management of hospital management information 
system. In addition to the information standardization and 
information construction has also made good results.  
On the other hand, because of the complexity of the 
business of medical and health information system, in the 
process of construction there are many problems. To sum up 
as follows: 
456
1) The lack of overall planning and unified standards. Due to 
the lack of long-term strategy and improve the overall 
planning, the lack of perfect standard system, each of the 
regions and units in accordance with their own information 
system construction, resulting in information exchange and 
sharing, system continuity and poor coordination.  
2) The information isolated island serious, data availability is 
not high. All kinds of application information system 
construction greatly improve the management of relevant 
department and emergency response speed. But because of 
the vertical construction characteristic of information system, 
a large number of “chimney” and “the information isolated 
island” has been formed.  
3) The information network is not open, the grassroots lag. 
China’s medical and health department is currently not 
covering the whole business health network, the medical and 
health unit in the network cannot achieve interconnection 
network ability.  
     With the new medical reform constantly deepening of 
information construction, medical and health industry has 
put forward higher requirements, needs more advanced 
technology, more hand also need to explore the construction 
mode change. The health and medical institutions 
independent construction pattern, lack of talents and 
information isolated and other issued cannot meet the 
development trend in the future.  Cloud computing 
technology can realize centralized deployment and 
maintenance, lower construction cost and maintenance cost 
and better realize the sharing of information resources, to 
provide on-demand customized service. Cloud computing 
and medical information integration for the information 
foundation weak base and rural health brought a lot of 
application opportunity. Overall cloud computing in the 
medical industry has a broad application prospect. Fujian 
Provincial Cancer Hospital is the only three first class tumor 
hospital with medical, teaching, research, prevention, 
rehabilitation and training in Fujian province. In 1979 the 
hospital was begun to build up. In 1984 the hospital was 
begun to receive the patients and was officially launched to 
open Nov.12, 1986. After 25 years of efforts, hospital in 
medical technology, equipment, services, environment, 
personnel training, medical management and hospital culture 
building have achieved leap development. Hospital are 
attached to the development of discipline construction, 
improve the level of management, strengthen the 
comprehensive treatment of tumors and technical innovation, 
formed with the surgical operation, radiotherapy, 
chemotherapy, stem cell transplantation in the treatment of 
department of internal medicine, combine traditional Chinese 
and Western medicine treatment, biological treatment, 
radiofrequency ablation, interventional therapy and thermal 
therapy and other features of the tumor comprehensive 
treatment system. At the present advanced medical 
imageology techniques and equipments such as 320-slice 
spiral CT, ultra-high field MRI, molecular imaging, 
functional imaging, multi-modality image fusion have 
brought out convenience to doctors’ early diagnosis and 
early treatment for cancer patients. As other hospitals, the 
application of traditional PACS (Picture Archiving and 
Communication Systems) in the construction of large-
 scaled regional medical images center was confronted 
with great economic and technical challenges as 
follows.  
1) High expenditure. The volumn of image data in 
PACS in a large-scaled first-calss third-level hospital would 
be on the order of terabytes or dozens of terabytes each year 
and medical omage data in a certain region would be on the 
order of hundreds of terabyres to even several petabytes. 
The traditiongal FC SAN in the construction of large-scaled 
storage system would lead to high expenditure. 
2) Limited performance and scalabiity. It was difficult 
to maintain the consistency of directory structure of the 
overall systen with extended storage devices. 
3) Limited availability. The commonly-employed storge 
model of “online, near-line, offline” in PACS could save the 
expense and quarantee diagnosis performance but it was at 
the expense of limited availability since it was difficult to 
obtain offline images. 
4) Absence of systematic software. The present full-
 PACS software is suitable for high-speed, stale and saft 
campus network. Procvideed in pure internet access with 
limited bandwidth, poor stability and firewall blocking 
system, such kind of software is difficult to meet application 
need.  
The rapidly developing cloud computing technologies 
turned out to be an effective approach to the construction of 
cost-efficient, high-performance, flexible and resilient 
regional medical imaging services platform. The presented 
project describes the construction of regional medical 
imaging services platform with cloud computing through 
various transfer media to provide services for SaaS-based 
tele-applications of medical imaging. The key point of the 
research goes to high-performance, reliable, scalable 
distributed storage architecture and parallel processing which 
were the basis of and key to regional medical imaging 
services platform [9].  At present there are a lot of cloud 
computing application projects which are building and 
exploring in main cities such as Beijing, Shanghai, Chengdu, 
Hangzhou, Qingdao and Xian in China. In order to promote 
the government service innovation, promote the information 
resource sharing, reduce the construction cost, the local 
government to actively carry out government cloud 
application projects, the government has become the basic 
platform of cloud platform of government information 
resources integration [10]. The main application fields of 
future government cloud are public service and public 
service of e-government cloud. And the public service cloud 
has mainly medical cloud, social security cloud and park 
cloud. Public service cloud need integrate various public 
resources and be suitable for deployment to the public cloud. 
Government cloud construction should pay full attention to 
the top-level design, strengthen the standard system 
construction, select the appropriate mode of construction,  
fully integrate the government, enterprises, universities and 
institutes resources, refer to domestic and foreign advanced 
construction experiences, avoid the implementation risk.

IV.  THE OVERALL TECHNICAL FRAMEWORK OF REGIONAL 
MEDICAL IMAGE CLOUD SERVICES PLATFORM 
As a world-widely largest search engine and cloud 
computing provider, Google was the first confronted with 
how to process large volumes of data (petabytes). It         
created GFS and MapReduce instead of applying traditional 
data store architecture and high performance computing. 
Through the accumulation of storing and computing capacity 
of thousands of common servers, it realized the efficient 
processing of large volumes of data, which proved to be a 
big success. Apache Hadoop is an open source 
implementation of Google GFS and MapReduce, which              
turned to be the most influential open source cloud 
computing platform and in wide application. Taken the          
characteristics of Hadoop and the requirement of medical    
imaging cloud platform into consideration, the basic 
structure of medical imaging cloud computing platform was 
designed with Hadoop HDFS and MapReduce.  
The benefits of Hadoop HDFS were presented as follows: 
l) It was particularly designed for rapid large volumes of data 
(petabytes) storing and processing, which was testified by 
Yahoo, Facebook, Amazon, Baidu, Taobao, etc. 2) High 
scalability. The increase of servers could realize the linear 
increase of storage capacity, disc I/O throughput rate and 
calculating capacity. 3) High redundancy. Each data block 
will be stored in three different nodes. 4) It is designed for 
streaming access, which is suitable for the long-term storage 
of medical images.  5)  Besides information storage capacity, 
MapReduce, coexisting with HDFS, could aggregate CPU 
power across the nodes for data-intensive applications such 
as image preprocessing, format converting, image fusion, 
CBIR (Content-based Image Retrieval), three dimensional 
reconstruction.5) HBase is the Hadoop database based on 
HDFS, which support large database table storage,  real-time 
random read and write. 6) Easy-transition. When decided to 
transit from classic file system (such as FC SAN) to HDFS, 
we should consider database, data repository transition. 
Hadoop architecture has tools like Sqoop to meet this need 
easily.  
Some problems existed in the construction of medical 
image storage system with Hadoop. Hadoop was designed 
for large files with default bloke size of 64MB? by 
contrast?frequently-seen medial images such as CT?MRI  
were about 500KB each and there were about 100 to 200 
images each scan. Suppose a sea of small files were stored in 
HDFS?excessive meta data would contribute to too much 
RAM consumption of Name Node and eventually decreased 
the performance of whole cluster. In addition?HDFS was 
not appropriate for the real-time application requiring            
low latency since its writing performed more weakly than its 
reading did?  which was not suitable for the real-time 
application of  PACS. 
To solve this problem?with Sequence File in Hadoop?
 a S-DICOM was specifically designed. Since with 
Key/Value pair?  all images from one patient within a        
Study can be combined into one serialized file?thus the 
process performance was improved significantly and RAM 
of Name Node had no risk of large consumption.               
Data with Key/Value pair served as the best input data 
format which was beneficial to medical-image-based data 
intensive applications. Though HDFS itself was not   
appropriate for real-time application?it was economical? 
highly scalable? reliable and with high Performance. Since 
traditional FC SAN was suitable for quick access to  small 
files? a kind of? online? archived? two-level model 
medical image storage architecture combined with the 
benefits of both FC SAN and HDFS?which was called 
HMISA(Hybrid Medical Image Storage Architecture) was 
specifically designed. Medical images produced within one 
year stored in FC SAN with original format?Which could 
fulfill the requirement of low latency of reading film and 
writing diagnosis reports. Those produced over one year 
would be converted into S-DICOM Format hosting in HDFS. 
With components of SDFO (S-DICOM File Operator)?       
reading and writing of images in substructure were 
shielded?which provided interface to query?reading and 
writing for upper layer applications and components. 
Another problem is that DICOM is the standard protocol 
of transmitting, and the communication between Work 
Station and Image Server is auto. But Image Servers don’t 
know how to operate HDFS when receiving message relative 
to HDFS, so an expanded message Parser is need. There are 
three components: Listener, Receiver, Service Maker to meet 
these remand. When DICOM message aims of operating 
HDFS, these three components can work to fit it.  
In accordance with IHE XDS-I specification basic and 
considering the relative concentration data, the service 
platform based in hybrid architecture has been used in the 
paper. Medical image diagnosis requires access to the 
courtyard image data, if data is stored in the area of medical 
image cloud services platform data center, according to the 
authorization access directly from the regional data center, or 
using XDS-1 specification from the regional image cloud 
services platform for patient’s index information of imaging 
data, and then to access from CS system in the hospital. The 
regional medical image cloud services platform network 
architecture is shown as Fig. 1. 
 
458
A.  Logical Architecture 
Medical image cloud services platform is composed of 
one center, two platforms and N services. A center is the 
regional medical imaging applications and data center, which 
can provide various types of image data storage, 
collaborative and operation management services for the 
regional medical institutions, health management.  In aspect 
of data storage, regional image data center can provide the 
off-line image storage and remote disaster recovery services 
for the major hospital. The data center can stored all the 
image data in the small hospital, a local cache only in the 
current image workstation can meet the needs of daily 
diagnostic imaging. In the collaborative aspects, regional 
medical center based on IHE PIX and IHE XDS-I 
specification provide cross hospital patient management 
service and image retrieval service for remote image 
consultation. The two platforms are virtualization hardware 
platform and software platform of SaaS model. 
Virtualization can be quickly for the various medical 
institutions to provide IaaS patterns of host hire service, 
hospital portal, hot backup of server, high performance 
computing applications with hardware resources. SaaS 
software provides the way that reduces the hardware and 
software installation and maintenance cost effective means. 
Due to the large amount of image data and large hospital 
PACS applications data of the diagnostic process of high 
real-time requirement, so it is still using the traditional mode 
of application. Other medical imaging of remote 
collaborative application can use SaaS model to B/S model 
software renting mode, mainly through the internet to 
achieve. The N services specifically include foundation, 
medical, teaching, scientific research and other applications.  
B. Network Architecture 
Various medical institutions and urban and rural residents 
may access area of medical image cloud services platform 
by the three ways of optical fiber access, VPN (virtual 
private network) and direct access through the Internet.  
C. Storage Architecture 
The storage system is designed into a kind of 
distributed and centralized storage hybrid PACS 
architecture. Hadoop clustering groups are built between 
hospital campus networks. These distributed data stored by 
HDFS Hadoop clusters make use of the MapReduce 
technology in large scale data computing. The whole system 
schematic diagram is shown in Fig. 2. 
 
D. The Implemrntation Steps of Medical Image Cloud 
Application Platform 
From technical development of Cloud Computing and 
the overall architecture and implementation of 
construction is a very complicated system engineering, 
not possible be done in one step, should be a gradual 
process. We have done some works according to the 
steps as following: 
Step 1: The integration of the existing image data in 
the hospital, standardization and optimization. As 
described in the previous section, the hospital park cloud 
application platform firstly is constructed, which belongs 
to the category of private cloud. According to the 
characteristics of medical image data, the related 
components in HDFS storage framework have been 
designed and partial implemented. The components 
include the two parts of DICOM protocol 
communication and exchange of medical image data 
storage and retrieval. We have done some comparative 
analysis by module testing.  
Step 2: By virtualization technology, the data resource 
can distribute according to actual needs.  
Step 3: Cloud computing implementation, building 
service oriented elastic, dynamic IT infrastructure, 
service, do distribute service by actual needs, service is 
under the control and computing.  
In a word, to sum up is as follows: integration and 
standardization, implementation of virtual, Cloud 
computing implementation. Now the medical image 
cloud application platform is shown Fig. 3.

V.  CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK 
Cloud computing deployment model led the physical 
boundary of the network disappears in the hospitals, the 
cloud facing the challenges of access control. . Users in the 
hospital are most concerned about data security. The 
virtualization security and data security are the main 
problems of the cloud computing security. Cloud computing 
security needs consider both technology and strategy, 
including audio, compliance and risk assessment. At the 
aspect of strategy management of security mechanisms in 
the China hospital, we should concern on the strategy of 
network security and management field [11] [12]. 
The medical data computing center construction is very 
complicated technology, choosing a proper construction 
mode is a new problem before the government department. 
We must integrate governments, enterprise, universities and 
institutes to do the cloud computing construction. We may 
suggest the construction mode. That is the typical private of 
government investment construction and independent 
operation and maintenance. And construction mode is 
gradually transition to the mixed cloud construction mode. 
By cloud medical system architecture frame, government 
medical and drug management department, government 
Health administration departments, each big hospital, 
community hospital, supplier of drugs, drug logistics 
company, Health insurance company and the patient to 
medical cloud platform, sharing through the electronic 
medical record in the remote consultation, online 
registration and make an appointment, efficient service, 
shorten the patient waiting, reimbursement process, save 
social resources, at the same time all patients can effectively 
shunt, ordinary patients will be scientific diversion to the 
community hospital, treatment and large comprehensive 
hospital focus more on difficult miscellaneous diseases and 
critically ill patients, alleviate the pressure of large hospital 
and the cloud platform of remote diagnosis ascending 
community hospital medical level.
