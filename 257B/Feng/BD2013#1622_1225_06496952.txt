AbstractÑRadar emitter signal identification is a special 
issue of data clustering for classifying unknown radar 
emitters. In this paper, an efficient approach for 
automatic classification of radar emitter signals in 
multisensor systems is proposed. The proposed approach 
exploits measured features extracted from multiple 
sensors as well as the sensor accuracies for classification 
of unknown multiple radar targets. The proposed 
approach can easily be applied to any number of sensors 
with different accuracies, any number of emitters, and 
any number of measured features without exponential 
growing of the required computations. The performance 
of the proposed classification approach is evaluated in 
terms of percentage of correct classification and 
compared to other classification approaches. The results 
show the feasibility and the effectiveness of the proposed 
classification approach.1

1. INTRODUCTION 
In recent years, multisensor systems are gaining interest in 
both military and civilian applications [1-10]. Multiradar 
systems imply the development of surveillance systems to 
monitor events. In this case, a number of distributed radars 
have been deployed to support surveillance and monitoring 
operations [11, 12]. Multiradar data fusion is the process by 
which measured features from diverse radars, sensing 
multiple targets, is fused to yield improved performance 
than could be achieved using a single radar system [13, 14]. 
The measured features are corrupted with different types of 
disturbances that are likely to occur in a typical multisensor 
system. Features refer to the parameter measured by the 
radars sensors and fusion is the process of combining the 
parameters of the sensed targets. Sensor fusion can be

efficiently applied to several military and civilian 
applications in order to increase the coverage area and 
improve the system accuracy.    
One of the main tasks performed by multisensor systems is 
the classification issue performed in surveillance 
applications. These systems are composed of multiple radars 
and one of their main tasks is classification of multiple radar 
emitter signals. Radar emitter classification is a special 
application of data clustering for classifying unknown radar 
emitters from received radar pulse samples. For example, for 
a multisensor coastal surveillance system presented in [11], 
it is composed of two platforms of sensors; a land-based 
platform and an airborne platform. The land-based platform 
is equipped with a land based radar, an automatic 
identification system, and an infrared camera. The airborne 
platform is equipped with an airborne radar, a video camera, 
and an infrared camera. There are many tasks performed by 
this multisensor systems including target detection, target 
tracking, threat assessment, and classification of multiple 
targets. Another practical example are the electronic warfare 
systems presented in [15]. Electronic warfare receivers are 
passive receivers which receive emissions from many 
platforms, and perform some analysis on these emissions. 
Some of these electronic warfare receivers receive radar 
pulses, measure the features of each pulse received, and then 
classify the pulses that belongs to the same emitter together 
to determine the radar features for each emitter. The 
measured features are then compared with values related to 
known radar types, to identify the emitter type. Another 
application is the classification of real-life audio signals that 
are collected by a ground surveillance radar mounted on a 
tank [16]. A human operator can operate the radar system to 
discern among small number of signals bouncing off tanks, 
vehicles, planes, and so on. The aim here is to achieve 
automatic target classification and reduce the number of 
personnel required in a tank; for example.         
The challenges in target emitter classification are real time 
processing, closely located radar clusters, and high 
dimensionality in terms of the number of emitters, the 
number of sensors, and the number of measured features. 
This paper proposes a novel and efficient approach for 
automatic radar emitter classification based on measured 
features from multiple sensors with different accuracies. The 
proposed approach treats all the measured features at once, 
not pairwise, and generates classification weights based on 
 2 
the measured features, prototype radar types, and the diverse 
sensor accuracies.  
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Problem formulation, assuming uncorrelated sensor errors, 
and a review of some published studies related to 
classification of radar emitter signals are considered in 
Section 2. The proposed classification approach is presented 
in Section 3. Performance evaluation and numerical results 
based on Monte Carlo simulations are reported in Section 4. 
Performance comparison with other classification 
approaches is also presented in Section 4. Section 5 contains 
the summary.  
 
2. PROBLEM FORMULATION AND A REVIEW OF 
SOME PUBLISHED STUDIES RELATED TO 
CLASSIFICATION OF RADAR EMITTER SIGNALS 
To simplify the problem formulation, we formulate the 
problem with a simple example. We assume a scenario of a 
multisensor multiemitter environment with two sensors, with 
different accuracies, and three emitters in an overlapping 
coverage scenario. Each sensor observes some emitters 
under surveillance and sends feature vectors to a central 
processor. We assume uncorrelated sensor errors. Sensor 1 
observes emitter 1 and emitter 2. Sensor 2 observes emitter 
2 and emitter 3. Due to the overlapping coverage, the 
number of feature vectors, reported to the central processor, 
is 4 feature vectors; although we only have 3 emitters. We 
assume that each feature vector, ,2,1,3,2,1, == jiijF  has 
two features, which are the radio frequency ( RF ) and the 
pulse repetition interval ( PRI ) of the observed emitter. 
Each feature vector, ijF , represents the features vector from 
sensor j  due to observing emitter i . The main goal is to 
find out which features  are similar (i.e. represent the same 
emitter) and dissimilar (i.e. represent different emitters) to 
each other.  
                                                    
With this simple example of two sensors, three emitters,  and 
two features, we can simply find the similar and dissimilar 
emitters. Two emitters that have about the same feature 
values are more similar than two emitters  that do not. But 
for large number of sensors, emitters, and visual inspection 
fails us and automatic classification becomes useful. 
Furthermore, the number of emitters is not known a priori, 
which makes the problem more complicated for a large 
number of emitters. The number of ways of classification of 
N  feature vectors into en  emitters is a Stirling number of 
the second kind  [9] and is given by

For even the relatively simple problem of classification of 
25 feature vectors into known 5 emitters, the number of 
ways (possibilities) is the quantity  
,751,110,974,684,436,2)5(25 =W                  (2) 
 
which is very large. The problem is compounded when the 
number of emitters is unknown. In this case, the number of 
possibilities increases markedly to

This example shows the essential need of automatic 
classification.  
 
In [15], a self-organizing neural network is proposed for 
clustering. This algorithm has the capability of  good 
clustering in real time applications. In [15], two parts are 
focused, emitters deinterleaving and PRF-type identification. 
The deinterleaving is done through parameters clustering. 
Two parameters are selected for clustering; direction of 
arrival and radio frequency. In [16], Radial basis function  
neural networks with training are used for target recognition 
to classify real-life audio radar signals that are collected by a 
ground surveillance radar mounted on a tank. Different 
signal classification models in the neural net literature, such 
as autoregressive model, are also considered in [16].  In 
[17], two radar target classification techniques developed to 
utilize radar returns are discussed. Both of these techniques 
utilize resonance region backscatter measurements of the 
radar cross section and the intrinsic target backscattered 
phase. The first technique uses nearest neighbor algorithms 
on the radar cross section magnitude and phase at a number 
of operating frequencies. The second technique uses an 
inverse Fourier transformation of the complex 
multifrequency radar returns to the time domain followed by 
cross correlation. Comparisons are made of the performance 
of the two techniques as a function of signal-to-error noise 
power ratio for various processing options. In [18], the 
problem of classifying radar target signals based on radio 
frequencies is discussed in case of Gaussian distributed 
observations. Two different classification approaches are 
analyzed, based on the adaptive coherent estimator and on 
the generalized likelihood ratio test. The performance of the 
two classification algorithms are evaluated analytically and 
by Monte Carlo simulations. In [19], an approach is 
proposed for intra-pulse feature extraction of radar emitter 
signals based on symbolic time series analysis. In this 
approach, embedding time-delay and modified Shannon 
entropy are used as two-dimensional feature vector to sort 
the interleaving radar signals. In [20], an approach for 
classification of multitemporal synthetic aperture radar 
images is presented. It has been developed by integrating an 
analysis of the multitemporal synthetic aperture radar signal 
physics with a pattern recognition approach. The system is 
made up of a feature-extraction module and a neural-
 network classifier, as well as a set of standard preprocessing 
procedures. This method reduces the complexity of the 
neural architecture, increases the generalization capabilities 
of the classifier, and relaxes the requirements relating to the 
number of training patterns to be used for classifier learning. 
 3 
In [21], two online clustering algorithms are developed for 
radar emitter classification. One is model-based using the 
minimum description length criterion and the other is based 
on competitive learning. Computational complexity is 
analyzed for each algorithm and then compared. Simulation 
results showed the superior performance of the model-based 
algorithm over competitive learning in terms of better 
classification accuracy, flexibility, and stability. In [22], a 
classification method is proposed to overcome the complex 
and dense pulses environment which is vital factor to restrict 
the efficiency of classification of the conventional multi-
 parameters signal sorting system. This method is considered 
as  a segment clustering radar signal sorting method based 
on support vector clustering  according to the statistics 
learning theory.  In [23], a three-layer vector neural network 
with a supervised learning algorithm suitable for signal 
classification in general, and for emitter identification in 
particular. The input features of the emitter identification 
problems include the radio frequency, pulse width, and pulse 
repetition interval of a received emitter signal. This method 
requires a training phase for the measured data.                   
 
In general, the computational cost in generating the optimal 
classification to the problems of classification of radar 
emitter signals is usually excessive and infeasible for real-
 time surveillance systems. Furthermore, they assume 
idealized modeling assumptions and a prior knowledge of 
the signal environment, which is limited in practice. It is 
worth noting that the use of an optimum, complicated, 
classification  techniques under idealized (impractical) 
assumptions may not achieve acceptable performance when 
these assumptions are not satisfied.   
 
Unlike the optimal solutions, the suboptimal solutions 
provide approximate solutions to the problems of  radar 
emitter signal classifications. The approximate solutions are 
based on neural network and fuzzy logic techniques. The 
major drawbacks to the neural network implementations are 
that they require unreasonable numbers of neurons and 
require training with a very large set of tracks [16, 23]. 
Fuzzy techniques have been proven very successfully in 
many classification problems. Fuzzy techniques are 
currently applied to important application areas such as 
medical imaging, robot vision, remote sensing, sonar 
systems and pattern recognition  and are rapidly growing to 
become a powerful technique for multisensor data fusion [7, 
10, 12].  Fuzzy systems are well suited to manage 
uncertainty and to model decision-making processes and 
offer the advantage of a clear understanding of their 
operation, because they construct knowledge by rules that 
resemble human thinking. For the problem of  classification, 
the distributed sensors use their input data to form an 
opinion, in the form of a fuzzy membership, on the 
environment. The features are fuzzified using membership 
functions. The outputs from the fuzzification are values 
between  0  and  1  and represent the correlation between all 
the feature vectors. These outputs are called fuzzy outputs. 
The fuzzy outputs from the fuzzification process are 
processed using fuzzy rules represented as IF THEN rules. 
The defuzzification process converts the fuzzy outputs to 
non-fuzzy outputs, which are called crisp data. The 
defuzzification outputs are analyzed and compared with 
each other or with thresholds to determine whether two/more 
feature vectors, obtained from two or more different sensors, 
represent the same emitter. Unfortunately, the extension of 
fuzzy techniques to the case of a large number of 
sensors/emitters/features is fairly complex due to the 
required large number of IF THEN rules [4, 12]. 
Furthermore, as the system complexity increases, it becomes 
difficult to determine the right set of rules and membership 
functions to describe the system behavior. In addition, the 
solution of the conventional fuzzy logic approach to the 
classification problem is an approximate solution, and the 
accuracy depends on several factors including the number of 
input variables, the number of linguistic variables, the 
choice of membership function, and the accuracy of fuzzy 
rules and statements. 
                                                       
3. PROPOSED APPROACH FOR AUTOMATIC 
RADAR EMITTER CLASSIFICATION  
First, we will consider the case of two feature vectors, then 
the proposed method can easily be applied to any number of 
feature vectors. We assume that we have two feature vectors 
from two different sensors due to observing some radar 
emitters. Let iF  be the feature vector, of fn  number of 
features, with corresponding resolution ,2,1, =iir i.e.

The features may be pulse repetition interval, pulse width, 
radio frequency with corresponding resolutions. It is 
required to decide whether the two feature vectors represent 
the same radar emitter or not.  
 
We consider this problem as a binary hypothesis testing 
problem for the two sensors. The two hypotheses are:

We have two choices of comparison to select; to compare

and iR  is the covariance of iF , which is related to the 
measurement noise.   
 
Define C  as a classification matrix of 
elements ijc , ,2,1,2,1 == ji  which represents the 
classification weight between feature vector j  and emitter 
i , such that:

It is required to obtain the classification weights

the difference between the two feature vectors iF  and jF  
(with respect to sensor j ). The classification decision iD  
based on resolution ir  can be determined based on the most 
accurate sensor ( 1D ) or on the least accurate sensor ( 2D ). 
With the diversity in the relative sensor resolutions, the 
classification decision is always based on the least accurate 
sensor [12, 26, 27]. In this case the classification decision 
will be

where in general, cD  is the classification decision based on 
the least accurate sensor (i.e. min( jjii cc , )). 
 
It is clear from (19) and (20) that: (1) The classification 
weights of the sensor resolutions are affected by the 
measured feature vectors. This means that the classification 
weights are adapted and changed automatically, (2) The 
classification weights of the comparison terms are obtained 
 5 
by treating all the feature vectors once. Thus it avoids the 
conflict situation when treating the feature vectors pairwise, 
(3) The proposed classification approach reduces the 
computational complexity with a factor of fn , where fn is 
the total number of features. This is because the proposed 
classification approach assigns only one classification 
weight to each feature vector rather than assigning one 
classification weight for each feature. This means that the 
number of comparisons does not grow with the number of 
features. This also reduces the sensitivity of the final 
classification decision to individual feature instabilities, and 
(4) Using the proposed classification approach,  feature 
vectors containing kinematics and non-kinematics data can 
be processed.  
 
 
4. SIMULATION RESULTS 
 
We consider the case of nine emitters with different radio 
frequencies (RF) and pulse repetition intervals (PRI).  
Figure 1 depicts the nine basic data points 
( 8....,,2,1,, 00 =iPRIRF ii ) where 0 denotes the original 
values of RF and  PRI  in a clear environment (unknown 
values). The separation (d) between data points is assumed 
to be equal (for simplicity). The measured RF and PRI are 
the original values plus noise. The noise in both  RF  and  
PRI  directions is assumed to be a zero mean Gaussian noise 
with a common standard deviation ? (SD =? ). Figure 2 
shows the scenario in case of random values in both  RF and 
PRI directions for small values of SD. In this case the 
problem of classification is simple. The classification 
problem will be a complicated problem in case of medium 
and large values of noise standard deviation. Figure 3 and 4 
show the scenario in case of random values in both  RF and 
PRI directions for medium and large values of SD, 
respectively.    
 
The resolution of each sensor is assumed to be 3 times the 
noise standard deviation ? , i.e.

The objective of any classification  approach is to determine 
the right number of emitters, which is 8 emitters in our 
example. The performance of the proposed classification  
approach is determined in terms of correctly classifying  the 
data points into eight emitters for different values of 
separation/sigma (d/SD). We process 1000 samples for each 
emitter, i.e. the total number of data points is eight 
thousands. The performance is evaluated as an average 
value over 10000 Monte Carlo simulations. We compare the 
performance of the proposed classification approach with 
the performance of Euclidean metric classification  [28, 29], 
the performance of Singer-Kanyuck  metric classification  
[26, 30-32], and the performance of a fuzzy classification 
approach presented in  [33].  
 
In case of Euclidean metric classification, the metric 
(comparison term) is [28]

which is compared to a threshold determined from the noise 
variances [4, 12, 34, 35]. 
 
In case of Singer-Kanyuck  metric classification , the metric 
is [26, 31] 
,||)(|| 1 jijiTjiijM FFRRFF ?+?= ?           (26)   
which is compared to a threshold determined from the chi-
 squared distribution of ijM  assuming Gaussian distributed 
observations [34-37].  
In case of the fuzzy classification approach presented in 
[33], the steps are summarized as follow: (1) The sensors 
use their input data to form an opinion, in the form of a 
fuzzy membership, (2) The features are fuzzified using the 
membership functions. The outputs from the fuzzification 
are values between  0  and  1  and represent the 
classification weights between all the feature vectors. These 
outputs are called fuzzy outputs, (3) The fuzzy outputs from 
the fuzzification process are processed using fuzzy rules 
represented as IF THEN rules, (4) The defuzzification 
process converts the fuzzy outputs to non-fuzzy outputs, and 
(5) The defuzzification outputs are analyzed and compared 
with each other or with thresholds to determine whether 
two/more feature vectors, obtained from two or more 
different sensors, represent the same emitter.   
Figure 5 compares the performance of the proposed 
classification approach with the performance of Euclidean 
metric classification [28], the performance of Singer-
 Kanyuck metric classification [31], and the performance of 
the fuzzy approach classification presented in [33]. The 
percentage of correct classification using Euclidean 
classification varies from  32.1% to  97.2%, while it varies 
from 46.9%  to 93.9% using the Singer-Kanyuck metric,  
varies from 59.05%  to 98 % using the fuzzy approach, and 
varies from 64.9%  to 98.5% using the proposed 
classification approach.  
From Fig. 5, it is clear that when d/SD = 0.25, the proposed 
approach achieves as much as 33% performance 
improvement, compared to the Euclidean classification, as 
opposed to 27% improvement  in case of the fuzzy approach 
and 15%  improvement in case of the Singer-Kanyuck 
metric. From Fig. 5, it is also clear that as the ratio d/SD 
increases the percentage of correct classification increases 
for all approaches.  
 
From Fig. 5, we conclude that the performance of the 
proposed classification approach is always better than the 
performance of the Euclidean classification metric, the 
Singer-Kanyuck classification metric, and the fuzzy

5. SUMMARY  
This paper considers the problem of classifying radar emitter 
signals produced by multisensor systems. An efficient 
approach for automatic classification of radar emitter signals 
in multisensor systems is proposed. The proposed 
classification approach determines classification of unknown 
multiple radar targets based on measured features extracted 
from multiple sensors as well as the sensor accuracies. The 
proposed approach can easily be applied to any number of 
sensors with different accuracies, any number of emitters, 
and any number of measured features. The performance of 
the proposed classification approach is evaluated in terms of 
percentage of correct classification and compared to 
Euclidean metric classification, Singer-Kanyuck  metric 
classification, and a fuzzy classification approach. The 
proposed approach achieves higher performance for all 
values of noise standard deviation compared to the other 
 7 
classification approaches. The proposed classification 
approach has the following advantages: (1) The 
classification weights of the sensor resolutions are affected 
by the measured feature vectors. This means that the 
classification weights are adapted and changed 
automatically, (2) The classification weights of the 
comparison terms are obtained by treating all the feature 
vectors once. Thus it avoids the conflict situation when 
treating the feature vectors pairwise, (3) The proposed 
classification approach reduces the computational 
complexity with a factor of fn , where fn is the total 
number of features. This is because the proposed 
classification approach assigns only one classification 
weight to each feature vector. This means that the number of 
comparisons does not grow with the number of features. 
This also reduces the sensitivity of the final classification 
decision to individual feature instabilities, and (4) Feature 
vectors containing kinematics and non-kinematics data can 
be processed.
