 AbstractÑWe analyze lung transplant data from the United
 Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) program with the aim
 of developing accurate risk prediction models for mortality
 within 1 year of lung transplant using data mining techniques.
 The data used in this study is de-identified and consists of 62
 predictor attributes, and 1-year posttranplant survial outcome
 for patients who underwent lung transplant between the years
 2005 and 2009. Our dataset had 5,319 such patient instances.
 Several data mining classification techniques were used on
 this data along with various data mining optimizations and
 validations to build predictive models for the abovementioned
 outcome. Prediction results were evaluated using c-statistic
 metric, and the highest c-statistic obtained was 0.68. Further,
 we also applied feature selection techniques to reduce the
 number of attributes in the model from 50 to 8, without any
 degradation in c-statistic. The final model was also found to
 outperform logistic regression, which is the most commonly
 used technique in predictive healthcare informatics. We believe
 that the resulting predictive model on the reduced dataset can
 be quite useful to integrate in a risk calculator to aid both
 physicians and patients in risk assessment.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 A lung transplant, or pulmonary transplant, is a surgical
 transplant procedure in which a patientÕs diseased lungs are
 partially or totally replaced by lungs which come from a
 donor. [1]. As of 2008, the survival rate for lung trans-
 plant after 1 year was 83.6% [2]. Complications of lung
 transplantation include rejection of the transplanted lung and
 infection [3]. Typical expenses range from around $600,000
 to $1,100,000 for single lung, double lung, and heart-lung
 transplant [4], [5].
 As organs available for transplant remain critically scarce,
 achieving maximal benefit from lung transplantation de-
 pends upon improved recipient and donor selection [6]. Thus
 accurate estimation of lung transplant outcomes can improve
 both informed patient consent by helping patients better
 understand its risks and benefits, and also aid the physicians
 in decision making by assessing the true patient-specific
 risks of the operation, rather than relying on population-wide
 risk assessments. To this end, accurate outcome prediction
 of performing transplantation is extremely important.
 The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) is a
 private, non-profit organization that manages the nationÕs
 organ transplant system under contract with the federal
 government [7]. UNOS is involved in many aspects of the
 organ transplant and donation process, including maintaining
 the database that contains all organ transplant data for every
 transplant event that occurs in the US.
 Applying data mining techniques to lung transplantation
 data can be useful to rank and link pretransplantation at-
 tributes to the outcome. Here we use data mining tech-
 niques on UNOS lung transplantation data to estimate 1-
 year survival of lung transplant patients, based on pretrans-
 plant characteristics. Experiments with nearly 50 modeling
 techniques were conducted and the results compared to
 find the best model for the data used in this study. It was
 found that rotation forest ensembles of alternation decision
 trees resulted in the best discrimination (c-statistic) between
 survived and non-survived lung recepients. Further, feature
 selection was used to find a smaller subset of attributes that
 can potentially achieve similar prediction performance, but
 can result in a simpler model.
 The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section
 2 describes the data mining techniques used in this study
 followed by a brief description of the UNOS data used in
 this study in Section 3. Experiments and results are presented
 in Section 4, and the conclusion and future work is presented
 in Section 5.

II. DATA MINING TECHNIQUES
 A. Modeling
 We used 47 classification schemes in this study, including
 both direct application of classification techniques and also
 constructing their ensembles using various ensembling tech-
 niques. Due to space limitations, here we briefly describe
 only those classification/ensembling techniques whose re-
 sults we present in the next section.
 1) Support vector machines: SVMs are based on the
 Structural Risk Minimization(SRM) principle from
 statistical learning theory. A detailed description of
 SVMs and SRM is available in [8]. In their basic
 form, SVMs attempt to perform classification by con-
 structing hyperplanes in a multidimensional space that
 separates the cases of different class labels. It supports
 both classification and regression tasks and can handle
 multiple continuous and nominal variables.
 2) Artificial neural networks: ANNs are networks of
 interconnected artificial neurons, and are commonly
 used for non-linear statistical data modeling to model
 complex relationships between inputs and outputs. The
 network includes a hidden layer of multiple artificial
 neurons connected to the inputs and outputs with
 different edge weights. The internal edge weights are
 ÕlearntÕ during the training process using techniques
 like back propagation. Several good descriptions of
 neural networks are available [9], [10]. It has been
 used for accurate estimation in different areas such as
 mobile health [11], drug abuse [12], civil engineering
 [13], computer vision [14] and video delivery [15],
 [16].
 3) Decision Table: Decision table typically constructs
 rules involving different combinations of attributes,
 which are selected using an attribute selection search
 method. Simple decision table majority classifier [17]
 has been shown to sometimes outperform state-of-the-
 art classifiers.
 4) KStar: KStar [18] is a lazy instance-based classifier,
 i.e., the class of a test instance is based upon the class
 of those training instances similar to it, as determined
 by some similarity function. It differs from other
 instance-based learners in that it uses an entropy-based
 distance function.
 5) Reduced error pruning tree: Commonly known as
 REPTree [19], it is a implementation of a fast decision
 tree learner, which builds a decision/regression tree
 using information gain/variance and prunes it using
 reduced-error pruning.
 6) Random forest: The Random Forest [20] classifier
 consists of multiple decision trees. The final class
 of an instance in a Random Forest is assigned by
 outputting the class that is the mode of the outputs
 of individual trees, which can produce robust and
 accurate classification, and ability to handle a very
 large number of input variables. It is relatively robust
 to overfitting and can handle datasets with highly
 imbalanced class distributions.
 7) Alternating decision tree: ADTree [21] is decision
 tree classifier which supports only binary classifica-
 tion. It consists of two types of nodes: decision nodes
 (specifying a predicate condition, like ÕageÕ > 45)
 and prediction nodes (containing a single real-value
 number). ADTrees always have prediction nodes as
 both root and leaves. An instance is classified by
 following all paths for which all decision nodes are
 true and summing the values of any prediction nodes
 that are traversed. This is different from the J48
 decision tree algorithm in which an instance follows
 only one path through the tree.
 8) Decision stump: A decision stump [19] is a weak tree-
 based machine learning model consisting of a single-
 level decision tree with a categorical or numeric class
 label. Decision stumps are usually used in ensemble
 machine learning techniques.
 9) Naive Bayes: The naive bayes classifier [22] is a
 simple probabilistic classifier that is based upon the
 Bayes theorem. This classifier makes strong assump-
 tions about the independence of the input features,
 which may not always be true. It makes use of the
 variables contained in the data sample, by observing
 and relating them individually to the target class,
 independent of each other. Despite this assumption,
 the naive bayes classifier works well in practice for a
 wide variety of datasets and often outperforms other
 complex classifiers.
 10) Bayesian Network: A Bayesian network is a graphical
 model that encodes probabilistic relationships among
 a set of variables, representing a set of random vari-
 ables and their conditional dependencies via a directed
 acyclic graph (DAG). Bayesian network learning can
 be used with various search algorithms for searching
 the network structures, and estimator algorithms for
 finding the conditional probability tables of the net-
 work.
 11) Logistic Regression: Logistic Regression [23] is used
 for prediction of the probability of occurrence of an
 event by fitting data to a sigmoidal S-shaped logistic
 curve. Logistic regression is often used with ridge
 estimators [24] to improve the parameter estimates and
 to reduce the error made by further predictions.
 12) AdaBoost: AdaBoost [25] is a commonly used en-
 sembling technique for boosting a nominal class clas-
 sifier. In general, boosting can be used to significantly
 reduce the error of any weak learning algorithm that
 consistently generates classifiers which need only be
 a little bit better than random guessing. It usually
 dramatically improves performance, but is also prone
 2
to overfitting.
 13) LogitBoost: The LogitBoost algorithm is an ensem-
 bling technique implementation of additive logistic
 regression which performs classification using a re-
 gression scheme as the base learner, and can handle
 multi-class problems. In [26], the authors explain the
 theoretical connection between Boosting and additive
 models.
 14) Bagging: Bagging [27] is a meta-algorithm to improve
 the stability of classification and regression algorithms
 by reducing variance. Bagging is usually applied to
 decision tree models to boost their performance. It in-
 volves generating a number of new training sets (called
 bootstrap modules) from the original set by sampling
 uniformly with replacement. The bootstrap modules
 are then used to generate models whose predictions
 are averaged to generate the final prediction. Bagging
 has been shown work better with decision trees than
 with linear models.
 15) Random subspace: The Random Subspace classi-
 fier [28] constructs a decision tree based classifier
 consisting of multiple trees, which are constructed
 systematically by pseudo-randomly selecting subsets
 of features, trying to achieve a balance between over-
 fitting and achieving maximum accuracy. It maintains
 highest accuracy on training data and improves on
 generalization accuracy as it grows in complexity.
 16) Rotation Forest: Rotation forest [29] is a method
 for generating classifier ensembles based on feature
 extraction, which can work both with classification
 and regression base learners. The training data for
 a the base classifier is created by applying Principal
 Component Analysis (PCA) [30] to K subsets of the
 feature set, followed by K axis rotations to form the
 new features for the base learner, to encourage simul-
 taneously individual accuracy and diversity within the
 ensemble.
 B. Feature Selection
 Feature selection techniques are typically used to select a
 subset of relevant features for use in a model. It is based
 on the assumption that data contains many redundant or
 irrelevant attributes that do not add much to the information
 provided by other existing attributes. We used 2 feature
 selection techniques in this study:
 1) Correlation Feature Selection (CFS): CFS is used
 to identify a subset of features highly correlated with
 the class variable and weakly correlated amongst them
 [31]. CFS was used in conjunction with a greedy
 stepwise search to find a subset S with best average
 merit, which is given by:
 MeritS =
 n.rfoÃ
 n+ n(n? 1).rff
 where n is the number of features in S, rfo is the
 average value of feature-outcome correlations, and rff
 is the average value of all feature-feature correlations.
 2) Information Gain: This is used to assess the relative
 predictive power of the predictor attributes, which
 evaluates the worth of an attribute by measuring the
 information gain with respect to the outcome status:
 IG(Class, Attrib) = H(Class)?H(Class|Attrib)
 where H(.) denotes the information entropy.
 The CFS technique evaluates subsets rather than individ-
 ual attributes, so it was first used to find a smaller subset of
 attributes. Subsequently, information gain was used on the
 reduced set of attributes to get a ranking of the attributes in
 the order of their predictive potential, as information gain
 evaluates each attribute independently.
 III. UNOS DATA
 The UNOS STAR Thoracic Organ Transplant and Waiting
 List File contains data on all transplant candidates and trans-
 plant recipients of heart, lung, and heart-lungs that have been
 listed or performed in the U.S. and reported to the OPTN
 since October 1987. Data entry by all US transplant centers
 is mandated by the 1984 National Transplantation Act. This
 cohort totals over 37,000 observations. There is one record
 per waiting list registration/transplant event. Each record
 includes the most recent follow-up data, including patient
 and graft survival, waittime, and the patientÕs list status
 (e.g., waiting, transplanted, removed prior to transplant, or
 dead). This dataset contains nearly 500 fields to charac-
 terize candidate/recipient and donor information including
 demographics (eg, age, race, sex), social history, and clinical
 information (eg, blood type, measures of lung function and
 hemodynamic measures, past medical and surgical history,
 serologies, and severity of co-morbid illness).
 UNOS provided de-identified patient-level data (data
 source #01052011-6). These data include all lung transplant
 recipients and donors in the U.S. and reported to the Organ
 Procurement and Transplantation Network between January
 1, 2005 and December 31, 2009. The use of these data is
 consistent with the regulations of our Institutional Review
 Board.
 The study population included 5,319 lung transpalnt pa-
 tients aged 18 years and older between January 1, 2005 and
 December 31, 2009. Patients were monitored from the date
 of transplantation to January 3, 2011, which was the last day
 of follow-up provided by UNOS. 62 predictor attributes were
 assessed. The primary outcome variable was 1-year post-
 transplant survival. We omit the details of all the input 62
 attributes here due to space constraints. A brief description
 of the selected subset 12 attributes used in the final model
 is presented later. Out of 5,319 patients, 1,061 patients
 (19.95%) did not survive more than 1 year after transplant.

IV. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS
 We used the WEKA toolkit 3.6.7 for the implementation
 of data mining techniques described earlier [32]. 3-fold
 cross-validation was used for evaluation. Cross-validation is
 routinely used to evaluate the prediction performance of data
 mining models to eliminate any chances of over-fitting. In
 k-fold cross-validation, the input data is randomly divided
 into k segments. k?1 segments are used to build the model
 and the remaining 1 segment unseen by the model is used
 to test/evaluate it. This is repeated k times with different
 test segments, and the results are aggregrated. In this way,
 each instance of the dataset is run through a model that
 has not seen it during the training phase. Running a test
 instance through a trained model generates a probability
 distribution for that instance to belong to different possible
 class values (here, binary 1-year survival). A probability
 cutoff is required to actually classify the test instance into
 one of the classes. For binary classification, 50% cutoff is
 most commonly used.
 A. Evaluation metrics
 Binary classification performance can be evaluated using
 various metrics. We use the following in this work:
 1) c-statistic (AUC): The ROC (Receiver operating char-
 acteristic) curve is a graphical plot of true positive
 rate and false positive rate. The area under the ROC
 curve (AUC or c-statistic) is an effective metric for
 evaluating binary classification performance, as it is
 independent of the probability cutoff and measures the
 discrimination power of the model. This is the primary
 metric used in this work for inter-model comparison.
 2) Overall accuracy: It is the percentage of predictions
 that are correct. For highly unbalanced classes where
 the minority class is the class of interest, overall
 accuracy by itself may not be a very useful indica-
 tor of classification performance, since even a trivial
 classifier that simply predicts the majority class would
 give high values of overall accuracy.
 Overall accuracy = (T P + T N)(T P + T N + F P + F N)
 where T P is the number of true positives (hits), T N
 is number of true negatives (correct rejections), F P
 is number of false positives (false alarms), and F N is
 number of false negatives (misses).
 3) Sensitivity (Recall): It is the percentage of positive
 labeled records that were predicted positive. Recall
 measures the completeness of the positive predictions.
 Sensitivity = T P(T P + F N)
 4) Specificity: It is the percentage of negative labeled
 records that were predicted negative, thus measuring
 the completeness of the negative predictions.
 Specificity = T N(T N + F P )
 5) Positive predictive value (Precision): It is the per-
 centage of positive predictions that are correct. Preci-
 sion measures the correctness of positive predictions.
 P ositive predictive value = T P(T P + F P )
 6) Negative predictive value: It is the percentage of neg-
 ative predictions that are correct, thereby measuring
 the correctness of negative predictions.
 Negative predictive value = T N(T N + F N)
 7) F-measure: It is in general, possible to have either
 good precision or good recall, at the cost of the other,
 and F-measure combines the two measures in a single
 metric by taking the harmonic mean of precision and
 recall.
 F ?measure = 2.precision.recall(precision+ recall)
 B. Modeling and Feature Selection
 As mentioned before, we used 47 classification schemes
 on this data. Fig. 1 present the results on 15 classification
 schemes for 1-year survival, consisting of most of the
 popular classifiers. For each of the ensembling techniques,
 many underlying classfiers were tried in the experiments
 but only the one with the best c-statistic is preented in the
 figure. Blue bars represent the c-statistic with the entire set
 of 62 attributes, and red bars represent the results with the
 reduced set after feature selection. Using correlation based
 feature selection (CFS) technique yielded a subset of only
 12 features for the given outcome of 1-year survival.
 The figures clearly show that many of the evaluated
 classification schemes perform comparably well for 1-year
 survival. Of all the models used in this study, Rotation Forest
 with Alternate Decision Trees as the underlying classifier
 gave the best c-statistic of 0.677 with 62 attributes, and of
 0.680 with 12 attributes. Thus, feature selection techniques
 were able to identify a much smaller subset without a loss
 in c-statistic.
 Figure 2 presents the relative predictive power of the
 resulting smaller subset of attributes identified by CFS for
 1-year survival. Following is a brief description of these 12
 attributes:
 1) Ability to perform daily activities: Functional status
 is an individualÕs ability to perform normal daily
 activities required to meet basic needs, fulfill usual
 roles, and maintain health and well-being. Decline in
 functional status is measured by an individualÕs loss
 of independence in activities of daily living (ADLs)
 over a period of time [33].

2) ICU at transplant: It represents whether the patient
 was in Intensive Care Unit at the time of transplant.
 Intensive Care Units cater to patients with the life-
 threatening conditions that require close monitoring
 and support in order to maintain normal bodily func-
 tions [34].
 3) Hospitalized at transplant: It represents whether the
 patient was already hospitalized when transplantation
 was done. In general, patients who are already in
 hospital tend to have lot of existing complications,
 infections, limited mobility, etc., which increases the
 risks of complications in addition to reducing the
 chance of successful outcomes.
 4) Lung Allocation Score at transplant: The lung
 allocation score (LAS) is a numerical value used
 by UNOS to assign relative priority for distributing
 donated lungs for transplantation within the US. It
 takes into account various measures of a patientÕs
 health in order to direct donated organs towards the
 patients who would best benefit from a lung transplant
 [35]. This attribute represents the lung allocation score
 at the time of translplant.
 5) Lung Allocation Score at Listing: Patients who are
 determined to be eligible for a lung transplant are
 placed on a waiting list. This waiting list is part of
 a national allocation system for donor organs run by
 the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network
 (OPTN) [36]. This attribute represents the lung allo-
 cation score at the time of listing.
 6) Intubated at transplant: Intubation refers to the
 insertion of a tube into an external or internal orifice
 of the body for the purpose of adding or removing
 fluids [37].
 7) GFR at transplant: Glomerular filtration rate (GFR)
 is a test used to check how well the kidneys are work-
 ing. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes
 through the tiny filters in the kidneys (glomeruli) per
 minute [38]. This attribute represents the GFR at the
 time of transplant.
 8) Previous lung transplant: It indicates whether the
 patient has undergone a lung transplant in the past.
 9) Age at transplant: The age of the patient at the time
 of transplant.
 10) ECMO at transplant: Extracorporeal membrane oxy-
 genation (ECMO) is an extracorporeal technique of
 providing both cardiac and respiratory support oxygen
 to patients whose heart and lungs are so severely
 diseased or damaged that they can no longer serve
 their function [39]. This is maximal life support, but
 requires continuous infusion of heparin and blood
 circulating through large tubes that exit the body.
 This attribute represents the ECMO at the time of
 transplant.
 11) Previous lung transplant <90 days: It indicates
 whether the patient has undergone a lung transplant
 within 90 days prior to the current transplant.
 12) Previous cardiac surgery: It indicates whether the
 patient has undergone a cardiac surgical procedure in
 the past.
 Using a predicted 1-year mortality risk ³50% as a
 cutoff, the sensitivity of the final model for predicting 1-
 year mortality was 12%, the specificity 98%, and the F-
 measure 20%. Table I summarizes the performance of the
 final model comparing it to logistic regression, which is the
 most widely used technique in healthcare informatics for
 predictive modeling.
 We believe that the preliminary results obtained in this
 work are quite encouraging and the fact that we can signif-
 icantly reduce the number of attrbutes in the model without
 sacrificing accuracy motivates integration of such models in
 clinical decision making.
 V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK
 In this workshop paper, we present our preliminary results
 of data mining on UNOS data on lung transplantation out-
 come. We evaluated nearly 50 classification schemes for pre-
 dicting 1-year survival after the transplant. c-statistic of up
 to 0.68 was achieved. Further, feature selection techniques
 were able to significantly reduce the number of attributes in
 the model, incurring no cost in c-statistic. We believe that
 the resulting models can be very useful to aid physicians
 in decision making by providing them with patient-specific
 risk estimations.
 Future work includes developing more sophisticated mod-
 els for the studied outcome, and also exploring conditional
 outcome models using some post-transplant information
 (e.g. risk of 2-year mortality, given that the patient has
 already survived 1 year after transplant), and exploring
 the use of undersampling/oversampling to deal with unbal-
 anced data. We also plan to do similar analysis for other
 transplants, and integrate the current and future work into
 healthcare and clinical decision making in practice, in the
 form of risk calculators.
