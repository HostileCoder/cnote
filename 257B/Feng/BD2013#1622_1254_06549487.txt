Abstract— From 2006-2012, George Mason University’s 
(GMU) division I men’s and women’s volleyball teams were 
outplayed by their top competitors within their associated 
conference. Analysis of historic data showed that the GMU’s 
men’s and women’s volleyball teams have a lower probability 
of scoring points on average of 0.21 and 0.05 respectively. The 
win/loss outcome is a function of the combinations of sequences 
of events caused by team’s actions and coach’s tactics. 
 The data is so complex that no human can comprehensively 
conduct the analysis. A Computer-Aided Analysis Tool (CAAT) is 
needed to analyze the underlying trends contributing to the 
wins and losses as well as provide a meaningful 
recommendation to improve the overall team performance in a 
volleyball game. The CAAT determines the probability of each 
transition that can occur in a volleyball game, uses an 
Absorbing Markov Chain to evaluate how events influence the 
point scoring probability, and runs a Monte Carlo Simulation 
to analyze how random variations in transition probabilities, 
caused by extreme conditional scenarios can affect the team 
performance and end result of a game.   
Four design alternatives were identified through analysis of 
historic data and evaluated for improving team performance 
through specific skill improvement training: 1) Increasing aces; 
2) Increasing kills; 3) Increasing blocks; 4) Decreasing errors.  
 A utility analysis was conducted to determine the most 
effective design alternative to achieve the target level of 
performance. Based on the utility analysis, the GMU’s women’s 
and men’s teams must focus on increasing their blocks. Out of 
10 blocks, at least 9 should lead to a point for the men and 3 
should lead to a point for the women in order to achieve the 
target level of performance. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
HE largest national non-profit collegiate sports 
organization in the United States is the National 
Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA). Its main 
mission is to promote student athlete development alongside 
higher education. Over 1,000 colleges are affiliated with the 
NCAA and over 400,000 student athletes participate every 
year. These colleges and universities invest large 
percentages of their auxiliary budget, equating to thousands, 
some even millions of dollars into their sports’ programs.

The NCAA divides teams into Division I, II, or III 
based on each school’s choice of competition level that best 
fits its mission. NCAA strives to ensure fairness within the 
competition. Divisions are further divided into regional 
conferences. Each university that participates in the NCAA 
must affiliate all of its sports programs with one of the three 
divisions [4].  
Historical trends show correlations between D-I team’s 
competitive success with respect to their associated large 
fiscal budgets, high expectations, high coach’s salary and 
quantity of athletic scholarships [7][8]. This created a need 
for coaches to come up with new methods to assist in 
making sound judgments and quick decisions on and off the 
playing field, to win against the best competitors and meet 
the expectations of their school. 
While some stakeholders, in the field of sports, use small 
data and basic analysis to assist with strategic development, 
others use observational performance as a general rule of 
thumb in making decisions. These approaches are limited by 
their small data sets and or their subjective theories that 
correlate the actions performed in a game with the 
quantitative outcome [9]. 
II. CONTEXT AND STAKEHOLDERS 
A. Collegiate Sport Specific Study 
Every season, the GMU’s men’s program competes in the 
Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association (EIVA) 
conference and the GMU’s women’s volleyball program 
competes in the Colonial Athletics Association (CAA) 
conference. The winning percentage of each conference 
match is used for bracketing and seeding criteria for post-
 season championship bid decisions. The winning percentage 
is calculated using the win/loss record and is used to 
measure competitive success. 
GMU’s intercollegiate athletic department (ICA) 
committee and the athletic director, use an evaluation to 
assess and quantify the coach’s job performance relative to 
outcomes desired and other performance criteria of the 
program (Fig.1).  
The coach’s evaluation is comprised of two main 
categories: Leadership which constitutes 75% of the 
evaluation, and Management which constitutes 25% of the 
evaluation. With respect to the coach’s evaluation, 
competitive success is a sub-category of leadership. It holds 
one of the largest weights, 30%. (Fig.1). Thus, competitive 
success is the focus of study.

B. Focus of Study 
In 2011-2012, GMU’s men’s volleyball was ranked 16th 
out of 27 Division I teams. Since 2000, GMU’s men’s 
volleyball program has averaged a winning percentage of 
55%, which is a 5% higher average than that of all the teams 
that make up the EIVA conference. However, their winning 
percentage record is decreasing with a slope of -0.0074 
(Fig.2). 
In relation to GMU men’s volleyball program, PSU’s 
men’s volleyball (PSU), also, participates in the EIVA 
conference and has an average winning percentage of 79%. 
PSU’s men’s volleyball is consistently improving, as their 
yearly winning percentage increases with a slope of +0.0068 
(Fig. 2), thus, making PSU the most competitive team in the 
EIVA conference.  
PSU’s men’s volleyball team’s winning percentage varies 
by only 0.78%, unlike GMU men’s volleyball team, whose 
winning percentage varies by 2.85% (Fig. 2). The winning 
percentage gap between GMU and PSU, quantifies the 
approximate target winning average GMU has to increase 
their current winning percentage by, in order to consistently 
maintain a lead over PSU and other EIVA conference teams.

In 2011-2012, GMU’s women’s volleyball was ranked 
220th out of 327 Division I teams. Since 2000, GMU’s 
women’s volleyball program has averaged a winning 
percentage of 47.8%, which is a 2.2% lower average than 
that of all the teams that make up the CAA conference 
(Fig.4). Moreover, GMU’s winning percentage record is 
decreasing with a slope of -0.0283 (Fig.5). 
Northeastern University women’s volleyball team (NE) 
competes within the CAA conference with a winning 
percentage of 61.4%, well above the average of the 
conference. NE’s women’s volleyball team is consistently 
improving, as their winning percentage is increasing with 
slope of +0.0102 (Fig.3), making them a top competitor of 
the CAA conference.  
NE’s seasonal winning percentage varies by only 0.94%, 
whereas GMU’s winning percentage varies by 4.17% 
(Fig.3). The winning percentage gap between GMU and NE, 
quantifies the approximate target winning average GMU’s 
women’s volleyball team has to increase their current 
winning percentage by, in order to consistently maintain a 
lead over NE and other CAA conference teams.

III. PROBLEM AND NEED STATEMENTS 
A. GMU’s Women’s Volleyball Team 
GMU’s women’s volleyball team’s average conference 
winning percentage between years 2000-2012 is below the 
average conference winning percentage of NE (Fig.4). 
Compared to NE, they have a, higher variance in their 
winning percentages for those years (Fig.5). According to 
official NCAA box scores, GMU’s women’s volleyball team 
only won 3 out of 13 matches against NE between years 
2006 and 2012, equating to a 23.07% winning percentage 
against Northeastern’s women’s volleyball team.  
Overtime, GMU’s women’s team needs to increase their 
overall conference winning percentage by more than 27.15% 
to compete, as a top contender, for the lead in their 
conference. Moreover, there is a need to reverse the 
decreasing trend and maintain consistency by reducing the 
variance of their winning percentages by about 77.5%. In 
order to satisfy this need, GMU’s women’s volleyball team 
needs to win at least 50% or more of their matches, each 
season, against their top competitor. 
B. GMU’s Men’s Volleyball Team 
GMU’s men’s volleyball team’s average conference 
winning percentage is above the average of the conference 
teams by 5%. However, compared to PSU, they have a lower 
winning percentage average and a higher variance in their 
winning percentages. According to official NCAA box 
scores, GMU’s men’s volleyball team only won 2 out of 26 
matches against PSU between years 2006 and 2012, 
20
  
equating to a 7.7% winning percentage against PSU’s men’s 
volleyball team.  
Overtime, the men’s volleyball team needs to increase 
their average overall winning percentage by more than 
43.7% in order to take the lead in their conference. They also 
need to reverse the decreasing trend and maintain 
consistency by reducing the variance of their winning 
percentage by about 72.25%. In order to satisfy this need, 
GMU’s men’s volleyball needs to win at least 50% or more 
of their matches, each season, against their top competitor. 
 
In both the men’s and women’s cases, objective and 
comprehensive assessment of game event performance is 
required to identify the skills that could be improved to 
enhance each volleyball program’s win/loss record. 
IV. DESIGN ALTERNATIVES 
A trend analysis was conducted, using historical data from 
196 box scores of matches played against several teams from 
2002-2012. The trend analysis was used to determine which 
transitions directly lead to points and their level of 
contribution to point scoring. The analysis was done for both 
GMU’s teams and the top competitor’s teams and was used 
to derive the design alternatives of transitions that directly 
lead to points. 
A. Increasing Aces  
A service ace occurs when a team serves the ball and that 
ball transitions directly to a point for that team without 
undergoing any other transitions.  
B. Increasing Blocks 
Blocks are used to strategically land the ball in the 
opposing team’s side of the court or deflect the ball from 
being spiked by the opposing team, resulting in a point.  
C. Increasing Kills 
A kill is a particular type of an attack that results in a 
direct point by grounding the ball in the opposing team’s 
side of the court.  
D. Decreasing Errors 
 Errors include multiple transitions because an error can 
occur between multiple actions. This design alternative 
includes service errors; ball-handling errors, from passes and 
sets; blocking errors; receptions errors; and attacking errors. 
These errors made by a team are transitions that directly 
contribute to points for their opposing team.  
 
In 2011-2012, both GMU’s men’s and women’s 
volleyball programs had a point scoring probability of less 
than 0.5. Northeastern and Penn State’s point scoring 
probability was greater than 0.5 against GMU’s volleyball 
programs.  Official NCAA box scores were used to validate 
the baseline distribution for these design alternatives. In 
order to assess the sensitivity of the winning percentage 
outcome, for each design alternative, the simulation is 
required to replicate all transitions between the two teams. 
V. METHOD OF ANALYSIS 
A. Simulation 
The analysis conducted, to assist in determining the most 
beneficial design alternative, utilizes a stochastic Monte 
Carlo simulator. As a mathematical system, the simulation 
models an Absorbing Markov Chain (AMC) process that is 
representative of a volleyball game’s actions and transitions. 
Multiple states and transitions occur, where states are 
independent actions and transitions are dependent events.  
The simulator defines serves, pass/receives, sets, and 
blocks as transient states and points as absorbing states. 
Thus, there are 10 transient states and 2 absorbing states 
(Fig.4). The simulation accounts for two teams, representing 
GMU as ‘A’ and their associated top opponent as ‘B’.  
Each state represents an action that occurs in the 
simulated game. A transition occurs to and from a state, and 
the chances of a transition occurring is referred to as a 
transitional probability. A game is won, once one of the two 
teams obtains a total of 25 points and is 2 points ahead of the 
other team’s score. The match is won, once 3 out of five 
games have been won by one of the two teams. The 
simulator parsing processor function quantifies the 
experimental probabilities into actual values of occurrences. 
 
Fig. 4 Volleyball Game Simulation is modeled by an Absorbing Markov 
Chain, in which all the states and transitions are depicted in the model and 
simulation. 
 
B. Methodology  
A video analysis was conducted, using a sample size of 6 
matches that were watched for both GMU’s men’s and 
women’s volleyball. This analysis was used to collect 
transitional data between events such as serves, sets, passes, 
attacks, blocks and points. An estimated 1,400 transitions 
occurred per match. The data accumulated for each video 
analysis was used to calculate the average for a baseline 
distribution for each type of transition. Refer to Fig.5. 
A random number is generated, within the simulation, 
after each transition. The random number that is generated 
falls within a respected distribution interval of a given 
transient or absorbing state. The transition probabilities of a 
transient and absorbing state must sum up to 1. Therefore, 
the parameters of each transient state’s transitional 
probabilities are measured within 0 to 1.  This represents the 
likelihood of an event occurring between states and or within 
a state. Refer to Fig.4. 
This process is continued until a transition goes to an 
absorbing state. An absorbing state is one that once reached, 
no further transitions can occur from it to any other state. 
Once the ball has reached an absorbing state of either team, 
21
  
a count keeps track of the score and the rally starts again 
with a serve by the team who won the point. Finally, the 
simulation outputs the point scoring probability, the winning 
percentage and number of occurrences for each transition for 
each team. Refer to Fig.5.  
 
 
Fig.5. Functional Block Diagram Process representing the input and outputs 
of the system. 
 
The simulator is used as a testing and verification 
mechanism, in that it quantifies the probability and number 
of occurrences needed to reach a target and optimal winning 
percentage. The random variables were based on a uniform 
distribution with associated mean and standard deviation for 
each match. The simulator runs 5,000 matches per second. 
The study conducted 10 runs per unit of probability 
increment or decrement, depending on the type of design 
alternative. The simulation completed 4,000,000 iterations in 
total, in order to ensure statistically significant model values 
when comparing it to the NCAA official box score data. The 
percent error of the simulation relative to the data is 2.11% 
for men’s volleyball and 2.56% for women’s volleyball. 
C. Absorbing State Matrix Calculations 
 
 
From the following matrix properties, listed in the Table I. 
The following matrix was used to obtain probability of 
points being scored in a match [2].  
 
         (1) 
An AMC matrix’s entries reflect the probabilities of 
transitioning from any state i to any state j. The following 
equation (2) was derived to determine the average 
probability of points scored in a given match. 
 
                                        (2) 
Thereby, increasing or decreasing the probability of one 
or more transition(s) can prove different cause-and-effect 
scenarios that can alter the way a team can play in future 
games. The value of a probability determines the sensitivity 
of an outcome. Probabilities in that matrix are adjusted to 
analyze the outcome of the match within the simulation. 
D. Changing Transitional Probabilities 
The sum of the transitional probabilities for each state has 
to equal one, if one transitional probability increases, the 
sum of all the transition probabilities within that state must 
still add up to 1. The formula used to determine the changes 
needed for the other transitional probabilities within a state 
of each design alternative was calculated using the following 
equation: 
                            (3) 
 
For this study, Wj is the new transitional probability for 
element j. Wj is the priority probability, which is the 
adjusted value made in element i, Wk
 o is the original 
transitional probability value of element j. ?Wk
 o
  is the sum 
of all other (original) transitional probabilities within that 
specific state (excluding the priority transitional probability). 
This assures that all values are normalized relative to the 
design of experiment’s value for each design alternative’s 
state’s probability (s). 
VI. RESULTS 
A. Extreme Variations in Input Assumptions 
In this study, the top teams in both the men’s volleyball 
EIVA conference and the women’s volleyball CAA 
conference are defined as the most competitive and 
consistent teams within the conference. The assumption is 
that, if GMU’s volleyball teams are able to defeat their 
associated top competitors within their conferences; then, 
they will be able to defeat all other teams within their 
conferences.  
The design alternatives were tested under the assumption 
that the opposing team’s performance remains consistent in 
transitional distributions with low variations in performance 
(Fig.1) and (Fig.2). If the distributions of either team 
changes over the year, these changes will need to be refined 
within the tool in order to obtain accurate information.

Sensitivity Analysis  
 
 
Fig.6. Sensitivity Analysis.  
 
The sensitivity analysis illustrates the cause-and-effects of 
the changes made to the original transitional probabilities. 
The sensitivity analysis was used to determine the design of 
experiment’s transitional probabilities analysis. (Fig.6). 
C. GMU’s Men’s and Women’s Volleyball’s Design of 
Experiment Simulation Results 
For GMU’s volleyball teams to compete as a top 
contender, solely based on the merit of improving skills, 
GMU’s volleyball teams needed to start by winning at least 
half of their matches played against their top competitors. 
Thus, the first set of simulation runs was based on improving 
skills that will always yield a 50% winning percentage 
outcome. To provide a range for the GMU coaches, another 
scenario was tested. The second set of simulation runs was 
based on improving skills that will always yield a 90% 
percentage winning percentage.  
 
TABLE II 
GMU MEN’S VOLLEYBALL DESIGN OF EXPERIMENT 
 
  
TABLE III 
GMU WOMEN’S VOLLEYBALL DESIGN OF EXPERIMENT 
 
 
 
The tables shown above represent the design of 
experiment for the GMU men’s and women’s volleyball 
teams. The first column lists all the design alternatives that 
were tested for this study.  The table is then sub-divided into 
three sections.  The first section lists the current transitional 
probabilities based on the current winning percentage of 
GMU against associated top competitor. These values are 
raw transitional data that was obtained by the video analysis 
conducted earlier in the study. The second and third sections 
list the experimental probability, which is the change in 
transitional probability from current transitional probability. 
The experimental probability is the value used in the 
simulation to achieve the associated winning percentages. 
The sections also list the number of occurrences needed to 
obtain the winning percentage of its associated experimental 
probability.  
All sets from GMU’s men’s volleyball team transitioned 
to the state of an attack for GMU’s men’s volleyball team, 
thus, no set errors occur. When GMU men’s volleyball 
team’s blocks to points transitional probability was increased 
to a probability of 1 for their team, the maximum winning 
percentage considering all other factors remain at their 
current status was 63.17%. Thus, blocks, as a design 
alternative for men was consider not applicable because it 
could not reach a 90% winning percentage at its maximum 
transitional probability. 
 
D. GMU’s Men’s and Women’s Volleyball Team 
Comparative Analysis 
A comparative analysis was performed to find differences 
and similarities between the results of the two simulated 
scenarios. These two scenarios were then compared to the 
average transitional probabilities that yield the current 
average winning percentage of GMU’s volleyball teams 
against their associated top competitor. There were not any 
comparative-analyses of combinations of alternatives 
conducted in this study. Each design alternative was 
analyzed independently and tested independently. All other 
transitions that were not related to the design alternative 
remained at their original probabilities.

Fig.8. GMU women’s simulated run based on conditional scenarios.

The comparative analysis indicates that each type of 
alternative will need a significant amount of improvement in 
order to achieve a winning percentage of 50% and 90% from 
the current winning percentage (Fig.7) and (Fig.8).  
 
E. Utility 
A utility function was developed to weigh the importance 
of three main aspects in decision-making done by the 
coaches, which are maintainability (MA), trainability (TR), 
and modifiability (MO). The utility values are based on 
achieving a 50% chance of winning because this is the 
minimum target outcome that will address the problem and 
satisfy the need. The weights for the utility were determined 
through discussion with GMU coaches, since they are the 
primary decision-makers. 
Maintainability is defined as consistency in performance, 
which addresses the long-term problem of decreasing the 
variability of GMU’s men’s and women’s conference 
performance. Trainability, of existing players, is sub-divided 
into efficiency (EFFY) and effectiveness (EFFT). Efficiency 
is defined as the time, effort, and resources needed for the 
intended task to achieve new standards. Effectiveness is 
defined as the capability of the team producing the desired 
results. Modifiability is the amount of change needed to 
obtain target winning percentage. The utility is denoted as 
U(x), which equates to the following:

                 (5) 
 
 
Fig. 9. GMU men’s and women’s volleyball utility values for design 
alternatives. 
 
The results of the utility function, (Fig.9); show that for 
both the men’s and the women’s teams, increasing blocks is 
the best alternative as it has the highest utility value. 
VII. RECOMMENDATIONS 
In order to determine the best alternative to recommend to 
the coaches, Table IV was developed to rank the alternatives 
from most effective to least effective based on the amount of 
change required to achieve the target performance and the 
utility analysis results for each design alternative. 
The left column of the table ranks the alternatives based 
on the amount of change is required while the right column 
of the table ranks the alternatives based on the utility of each 
alternative as explained previously. Refer to Table IV. 
 
TABLE IV 
RANKING OF DESIGN ALTERNATIVES  
 
Based on the rankings provided in the table for the 
women’s and men’s teams, it was determined that the 
coaches should focus on increasing blocks. By referring to 
Table II and Table III we can see that out of 10 blocks, at 
least 9 should lead to a point for the men and 3 should lead 
to a point for the women in order to achieve the target level 
of performance. Moreover, it was determined that decreasing 
errors is the second best alternative given that the teams 
focus on decreasing all errors simultaneously. Given that 
increasing kills and aces occupy the bottom ranks, the 
recommendation to the coaches would be to recruit players 
that are already good at hitting and serving.
