Abstract—E-commerce has rapid growth in the last two decades 
due to the development of information technologies, mobile 
network services and application of big data.  Nowadays, e-
 commerce has reached a stage in which e-businesses are far 
beyond the online trading of buy-pay-deliver, but covers a much 
broader spectrum of line business activities, such as financing, 
which indicates that e-commerce has been transited from 
monetary transfer to credit transfer. The financial services for e-
 businesses have now incurred fundamental changes in credit risk 
management, with significant impacts on the traditional credit 
system, such as timeliness, service quality, cash flow and liquidity, 
and scalability of services, etc.  In this paper, based on an online-
 credit scoring model, we identified important factors that 
improve the prediction accuracy of a credit scoring model and 
reduces the probability of default, which also demonstrated the 
important role of non-financial data in credit risk control in the 
e-businesses environment.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
The fast advancement of information technologies, the 
penetration of mobile network services, and the application of 
big data have been constantly empowering the growth of e-
 commerce since it was born in 1993. In early 21st century, e-
 commerce only accounted for less than 1% of retail sales in US 
due to lack of sufficient trust on the Internet [1]. Since then, 
with information technology development, consumers can 
easily get more and more information in e-commerce, which 
lowered their perceived risk and improved their perceived trust. 
The enhanced trust was positively related to consumers’ e-
 commerce participation, so it largely helped e-commerce 
development [2]. The e-commerce volume accounted for 4% of 
retail sales in US in 2010 [3]. In addition, the emergence of 
mobile technology facilitates e-commerce conducted from a 
wired network to a wireless network [4]. In the last two 
decades, we have witnessed how financial services, specifically 
e-payment services, contributed to the development of e-
 commerce. For example, advanced service like e-payment 
directly benefits e-commerce growth since it provides 
advanced competitive advantage for online consumers via 
lowering the cost of modernizing operations [5].  
In the meantime, e-commerce has in turn rewarded the 
finance industry with innovative ideas and cutting-edge e-
 finance services, which are making the e-commerce ecology 
more prosperous. E-finance is defined as “the provision of 
financial services and markets using electronic communication 
and computation” and it mainly covers the use of electronic 
payments, the operations of financial services and the operation 
of financial markets [6]. Nowadays, e-finance has reached a 
stage in which e-business are far beyond the online trading of 
buy-pay-deliver, but covers a much broader spectrum of online 
business activities, including loan, mortgages, guaranty, 
insurance, pledge, vouch, etc. All these are credit-based, 
indicating that the financial mechanism in e-commerce has 
been transited from monetary transfer to credit transfer. In this 
way, financial services for e-businesses have now heavily 
relied on credit risk management, the same as they are in brick-
 and-mortar businesses.  
The financial services in e-commerce are not just simply 
applications of financial services in the cyber world, but also 
incurring fundamental changes in credit risk management. E-
 finance has significant impacts on the traditional credit system, 
such as timeliness, service quality, cash flow and liquidity, and 
scalability of services, etc. Although banking industry has 
provided online loan application service, most financial 
institutions still evaluate applicants’ creditability and predict 
the probability of default by using official financial data and 
non-dynamic transaction information provided by applicants 
[7]. However, in the e-commerce market, the transactions are 
conducted online and could have huge changes within minutes, 
even seconds. The information used in traditional credit risk 
management cannot be updated in real time. Its hysteresis 
makes traditional method unsuitable for credit analysis in e-
 commerce [8]. For example, borrowers’ accurate real-time 
credit status and business information in e-commerce cannot be 
reflected by financial data, which is usually updated monthly or 
quarterly. The disability of being dynamic may significantly 
influence the accuracy of credit-scoring. So the traditional 
method is not suitable for online-credit scoring. In addition, 
unless provided by borrowers, the objective and comprehensive 
information about their business transactions is almost 
inaccessible for financing institutions, especially when the 
borrowers try to hide something having negative impacts on 
their credit. Therefore, a new method of analyzing creditability 
in e-commerce is urgently desired. 
The credit risk of e-commerce mainly comes from two 
sources: virtual feature of the Internet and information 
asymmetry [9]. The virtual feature of the Internet makes the 
traditional method of credit risk analysis ineffective in risk

prediction in e-commerce market. In a traditional business 
practice, where credit risk analysis is mainly based on financial 
data and conducted off-line, the process of analysis usually 
takes weeks or even months. However, in e-commerce 
transactions, rapid updating the business information makes 
financial institutions have great difficulties to get accurate 
financial information in time to analyze credit correctly. 
Moreover, organizations in the e-commerce market, especially 
small and medium enterprises, have comparatively higher 
capital turnover than normal entity companies. The traditional 
financing process takes too long time to satisfy their capital 
demands. Therefore, financial institutions need to apply a more 
efficient and effective credit scoring method to satisfy 
borrowers’ financing needs, as well as to control the credit risk. 
Additionally, for commerce market, lots of prior researches 
investigate the factors that could help to mitigate the 
information asymmetry, and are mainly focused on two aspects: 
hard credit information and soft credit information. Hard credit 
information is financial information, while soft credit 
information is defined as the non-financial data about business. 
In this paper, we argue that not only financial data but also 
non-financial data should be used to evaluate credit in e-
 commerce market since the mature aspect of soft information 
for mitigating information asymmetry. Although measurable 
financial factors are important, it cannot represent a 
comprehensive picture about credit. For example, the 
traditional method of credit risk analysis cannot measure the 
social network in e-commerce market. The non-financial 
factors (quality of management, market position, transaction 
details, etc.) can provide a deep insight into credit measurement. 
Therefore, to control credit risk in e-commerce market, an 
online credit analysis system taking account of non-financial 
data is needed urgently, which uses dynamic data and takes 
both hard and soft credit information into account. 
In this paper, we identify important non-financial factors by 
using a comprehensive dataset about e-commerce transactions. 
It is provided by a Chinese network technology company who 
owns the most prominent B2B market in China. This research 
contributes to credit risk management in e-commerce by 
revealing the fundamental difference between online credit 
scoring and traditional credit scoring. It also contributes to e-
 finance business by revealing key factors in the online credit 
risk analysis. And it adds to the big data application area by 
considering non-financial data in credit risk analysis. Finally, 
this paper demonstrates that the e-commerce market has 
promising future and it’s ready for other e-finance derivatives’ 
development. 
II. ONLINE CREDIT SCORING FOR E-COMMERCE 
Credit scoring is a technique that uses information collected 
by banks and/or other financial institutions to reduce the 
probability of customer default, which indicates credit risk [10]. 
The traditional credit scoring model used to control credit risk 
is mainly built upon the information about an applicant’s 
ability to repay, project risk, and willingness-to-pay. Firstly, an 
applicant’s ability to repay is usually measured by financial 
data that can demonstrate his existing capital and financial 
status, such as the balance of checking account and cash flow. 
Secondly, accurate prediction on project risk is essential to 
control credit risk. Most applicants apply for loan service 
because of lacking capital to run projects. Therefore, the 
characteristics of projects and characteristics of applicants 
determine the projects’ risk. The project risk is high in both 
situations: people with high risk sense apply for financing a 
low risky project and people with low risk sense apply for 
financing a high risky project. Lastly, willingness-to-pay 
should also be included in the credit scoring model. According 
to the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), “people are rational 
individuals and behavior motive is an important basis for 
detection of behavior” [11].  Therefore, it is possible that a 
borrower does not fulfill debt service obligations if the 
perceived costs associated with repayment exceed the benefits, 
even though he has the ability to repay [12]. For a specific debt 
or loan, the borrower’s willingness-to-pay largely depends on 
his perceived value of trust and the priority of debt. It can be 
perceived from the historical behavior, such as payment record, 
default record, etc. 
To some extent, an online credit scoring model is different 
from the traditional one due to its unique characteristics. For 
example, compared with traditional credit scoring, it is hard to 
obtain formal record of financial activities of a business via 
financial statement. However, the e-commerce platform 
records every single transaction which can be used as 
alternatives for online credit scoring. In e-commerce, credit 
risk management is still based on measuring the applicant’s 
ability to repay, project risk, and willingness-to-pay. But the 
information used here is non-financial data. The e-commerce 
market is commonly viewed as an open community offering 
both opportunities and threats. Community-based reputations 
can help financial institutions evaluate trustworthiness in the e-
 commerce environment and predict community members’ 
future debt behavior [13]. Thus, the applicant’s reputation can 
be considered as his social capital and used to demonstrate his 
ability to repay. In terms of project risk control, the online 
credit scoring model uses real-time transaction information, 
which should be more accurate than traditional methods. Is the 
project common for the borrower? How is the total business 
situation? How big is the involved market risk if compared 
with other members in e-commerce market? All the transaction 
information is available and updated online, so the online credit 
scoring model is more dynamic than traditional methods. The 
willingness-to-pay can be seen from the historical behavior, 
although the used information is not the same. Instead of 
evaluating financial data, historical records on the fulfillment 
of a contract, such as records of fulfillment, quality of 
fulfillment, and dependency on the project, are used to 
demonstrate borrowers’ willingness-to-pay.  
In 1999, Gebauer and Scharl [14] described four phases in 
e-commerce transactions process: information (seeking and 
collecting information), negotiation (establishing a contract), 
settlement (defining transactions), and after-sale [15]. From the 
perspective of procurement, the process is divided into two 
phases: contracting (sourcing and available to promise) and 
settlement (transaction and delivery) [16]. The specific 
activities among different phases can have some overlaps due 
to the different sequence of pay and delivery in online 
transactions. As mentioned before, the data used in traditional 
credit scoring model is financial data, which is mainly about 
payments. It seems that traditional method can only control risk 
and analyze credit in the settlement phase. However, in e-
 commerce, all the other phases before settlement involve credit. 
For example, the inquiry record shows how many potential 
customers are interested in the product. Comparing the inquiry 
record with the number of successful transaction, a convert rate 
may indicate the probability of business success in the future 
and the reliability of the business owner. In the negotiation 
phase, if the borrower is willing to disclose his business 
information and commit to reinforcing the relationship with the 
financial institution, he shows willingness to trade and could be 
more trustful than others who do not have willingness to 
disclose [17].  
According to our date set, the guarantee transaction service 
that the financial institution provides to its B2B customers does 
not only deal with the lending issue, but also covers problems 
in other aspects, such as the buyer’s payment issue, the quality 
of product/service, the timeliness of delivery, the follow-up 
after sales, etc. Any inaccuracy in above fields leads to lost and 
commercial disputes between buyers and customers in e-
 commerce, which will involve compensation and guarantee 
payment. The traditional financing method does not cover such 
kind of issues, so we would like to investigate some unsolved 
problems. For example, since credit issue exists in negotiation 
and contract phases, will a credit scoring model starting credit 
measurement from contract phase be better? To measure the 
credit in contract phase, what kind of indicators should be used? 
How to do credit scoring if no financial information available? 
To try to answer these questions, we propose some hypotheses 
and test them by using non-financial transaction data in the real 
world. We investigate the relationship between non-financial 
data in e-commerce transactions and default probability. We 
find that transparent information, willingness to disclose 
information and dependency on e-commerce are influential 
factors in e-commerce market.  
III. NON-FINANCIAL FACTORS IN CREDIT SCORING 
E-commerce platform records all the details about each 
online transaction except for payment information and enables 
the financial institution to have lots of information to evaluate 
customers’ credit. Being able to use dynamic data is the unique 
characteristic of the online credit scoring model. Therefore, any 
online change can be traced and monitored. The transparent 
information lessens information asymmetry [18]. For the 
financial institution, the reduction on information asymmetry 
provides it with more correct data that can be used in credit 
scoring model to get more accurate default prediction. For the 
TP members, the transparency acts as an invisible power that 
monitors their activities and has them fulfilled debt obligations, 
which reduce the default probability. Thus, 
H1a. Transparent information reduces the probability of 
default by enable lenders to monitor borrowers’ online 
activity. 
H1b. Transparent information improves the prediction 
accuracy of online credit scoring model by reducing 
information asymmetry. 
 
In B2B market, companies do businesses online. They have 
the right to change settings and post some information on the 
website to make their products attractive. To facilitate doing 
businesses online, they can also disclose firm’s information, 
such as address, phone number, decorate website, bind 
telephone with website, etc. Their willingness to disclose 
information in e-commerce exchanges shows their trust on the 
website [19]. Trust between borrowers and lenders increases 
the longer they work together [20]. The cooperation always 
increases with a higher frequency of contact in the relationship, 
which indicates their business dependency on the market. 
Attempts to reduce dependency can be seen as evidence of a 
lack of trust [21]. The perception of dependency makes 
companies value the relationship with the e-commerce 
platform, which is the financial institution. Therefore, if 
borrowers’ business is mainly accomplished online, they 
probably will not do harm to the relationship. From another 
perspective, the lending relationship can be considered as a 
specific asset. The more efforts borrowers commit to the 
relationship, such as pay for an annual fee and protection fun, 
the cost is high. Therefore, if the costs associated with the 
breaking lending relationship are higher than the benefits, the 
borrowers will try to make payments on time and avoid default. 
Thus, 
H2a. The willingness to disclose in e-commerce exchanges 
increases the dependency on the e-commerce market. 
H2b. The dependency on the e-commerce market reduces the 
probability of default. 
 
IV. METHOD 
In this paper, we use a data set provided by a Chinese 
network technology company who owns the most prominent 
B2B market in China (called as “financial institution” later). 
To promote the development of e-commerce and facilitate 
transactions among small and medium enterprises, the 
financial institution launched a program named “TP”, 
providing credit guarantee service to companies who 
registered in its B2B market (called as “customer” later). The 
credit guarantee service includes loan and guarantee payment. 
The customers who joined the TP program are TP members 
and can obtain some credit grant provided by the financial 
institution. Meanwhile, to join the program and maintain the 
membership, TP members need to pay the yearly fee. It means, 
for the financial institution, the more TP members, the more 
collected fee. However, it faces credit risk in this e-finance 
environment, such as losses if TP members do not have the 
ability to repay. Therefore, how to measure customers’ credit 
and control the risk are big challenges. 
The data set contains the information about 10,116 
customers in the B2B market. For each customer, there are 
supposed to have 104 variables to describe its business 
characteristics, transactions, and the credit grant in the financial 
institution. To find out the key factors having influence on the 
probability of default, we use Neural Network in a data mining 
software SAS for regression analysis, analyzing the 
relationship between independent variables (non-financial data) 
and dependent variable (the number of default). The variables 
used as predictors provide a comprehensive picture about 
customers’ business behavior, which can be grouped into three 
aspects. The first group refers to the behaviors acted by 
customers. Does the customer bind his cell phone to e-platform? 
Does he log in the trade link frequently? The second group 
refers to the behaviors incurred within transactions, such as the 
transaction amount within last 30 days, the credit grant, the 
total number of successful transactions, etc. The last group 
refers to objective and stable characteristics, such as TP type, 
TP period, and other data that may not be changed frequently. 
In the analysis of each variable, we classified the customers 
according to different levels of the variable and tried to find the 
relationship between the single variable and the default record. 
Then, we did group analysis by including variables with similar 
characteristics in credit model simultaneously and tried to find 
the relationship between cluster variables and default record. 
 
V. RESULT 
According to the results of regression for number of default, 
some key factors are statistically significant (p<0.1). It shows 
that the distribution of default for TP members is much lower 
than that for non-TP members. And the variables related to TP 
program are significant in the model. TP period refers to the 
length of membership, which is classified as short term 
membership, mid-term membership and long term membership. 
The results indicate that the length of relationship should be 
included in the credit scoring model, since the distribution of 
default for customers with the long term relationship is much 
lower than that for customers with the mid-term relationship 
and short term relationship. In addition, TP product type is also 
a key factors having impact on the distribution of default. 
Customers who pay for long lending period have a strong 
willingness of building or maintaining the relationship, which 
indicate that they value their reputation and will protect it by 
making payment on time.

It can be seen that the e-commerce platform contains 
various information about B2B customers and TP program 
covers more information about TP members than general 
customers. In other words, the data about TP members is more 
transparent than that about non-TP members. Therefore, the 
credit risk of lending money to TP members is more 
controllable and measurable than the risk of lending money to 
general customers, which supports the hypothesis H1a. 
Additionally, one variable can be classified into different levels, 
which enables us to do more accurate analysis. After divided 
into three categories according to the length of relationship, 
customers can be further classified as groups having record of 
complaint or not.  In this way, we can find out how the number 
of complaint impacts the probability of default if customers 
have the same length of relationship. Seen from the results, the 
distribution of default for the customers who have length of 
over 5 years is much lower than that for the customers who 
have length of less than one year, even if their have the same 
number of complaint. It is obvious that the credit risk is very 
different between these two groups. We did the similar analysis 
by clustering different variables. The results of multi-level 
analysis show differences when compared with previous single 
level analysis. Therefore, the credit scoring model with 
transparent information can provide a more accurate prediction 
for customers with different characteristics by analyzing 
information from multiple angles. This conclusion supports the 
hypothesis H1b. 
The TP members have different level of activity. Basically, 
a B2B company will have relatively active online actions if 
most of its businesses are conducted online. It can be seen from 
the frequency of logging in, the number of feedback, the theme 
style, the authentication on website (email validation and 
mobile phone verification), etc. All these variables can also 
demonstrate the company’s willingness to disclose. The more 
activity it has, the more information it would be disclose. 
According to our results, there are some key factors that can 
have impact on the prediction of default. The customers who 
revised or decorated its website have a lower distribution of 
default than those do not. If the customer binds his cell phone 
to e-platform, the distribution of default will decrease from 
0.23 to 0.16. In addition, the distribution of default can 
decrease from 0.46 to 0.14, if the customer changed its 
company dictionary. These trends support the hypothesis H2a. 
The degree of dependency on e-platform varies among B2B 
companies. The willingness to disclose is also a signal of 
willingness to trade. The authentic information that customers 
input into the e-platform shows customers’ willingness to trade 
and their dependency on the e-commerce market. This 
conclusion supports the hypothesis H2b.

VI. DISCUSSIONS & CONCLUSION 
This research makes academic contributions to online 
credit-scoring in e-commerce by pointing out its fundamental 
differences with traditional credit-scoring method and the 
importance of non-financial data in credit scoring. In e-
 commerce, the credit evaluation could start from the very 
beginning of the transaction process, since the characteristics 
in each phase can demonstrate borrowers’ credit to some 
extent. Therefore, the credit risk in e-commerce is measured 
not by using the data about payment in the settlement phase, 
but by using the transaction information in previous steps 
(collecting information, negotiation, and contract). In addition, 
some key non-financial factors have influence on the 
prediction of the credit scoring model, which has been ignored 
in traditional methods. This paper also has practical 
contributions by revealing key factors in online credit scoring 
and providing some guidance to financial institutions in e-
 finance industry. According to the results, the online credit 
scoring model can be improved to produce more accurate 
prediction. There are a lot of unanswered questions about 
credit evaluation in e-commerce and e-finance, which leaves a 
wide area for researchers to discuss. In the future, the studies 
on credit in e-commerce could discuss deeper issues. Based on 
our results, it is believable that the result of prediction on 
default probability could be different if combining more 
variables as cluster variables. From other perspectives, to 
investigate the role of online credit scoring in e-financing area, 
it is necessary to find more theories to support practical 
phenomenon. What are the fundamental differences on credit 
measurements between contract phase and settlement phase? 
What kind of theories is needed to support the credit scoring 
model used in contract phase? With the rapid development of 
e-commerce, the problems with credit evaluation will become 
more complex. The e-commerce market has promising future 
and it’s ready for other e-finance derivatives’ development.
