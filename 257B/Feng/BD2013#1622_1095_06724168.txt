electric grid in which the demand and supply are balanced 
to meet the customers need. The paper deals with the 
formation of a cloud-based Smart Grid for analyzing the 
Bid-Data and taking decisions to balance the demand of 
customer needs. The proposed formation of smart grid will 
deal with Big Data set which will contain the data regarding 
the power usage patterns of customers, historic weather data 
of the location, the current demand and supply details. The 
grid will operate on the data being fetched from the cloud 
storage. The paper also focuses on smart grid being framed 
with the renewable energy sources.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
 
 The Smart Grid is formed as a combination of 
altering currents in which the production of electricity 
from the renewable energy sources are considered and 
analyzed whether if the supply will meet the demand and 
alternate decision to be taken by the Smart Grid in 
meeting the demand. The need for generation of 
electricity is growing worldwide and it has greater impact 
towards the industrial development of a country [1]. The 
growths in databases are also tremendously increasing as 
the historic data are helpful in the future analysis and can 
be taken as a factor for decision making. The historic 
weather data are stored in the cloud using the service 
“Cassandra” database and Hadoop File System is used to 
retrieve the needed data during the time of estimation of 
the need by the Smart Grid. The query language used to 
query the Cassandra database is the Hive Query Language 
also known as HiveQL. The paper aims in giving a 
proposal to form a cloud-based Smart Grid which will act 
as an intelligent system to maintain the balance between 
the demand and the supply. 
 
II. SMART GRID 
 
 The Smart Grid is formed by integrating the use of 
information technology, automation, telecommunications 
and electric network control. The electric network control 
in turn involves the sensors, smart meters and deployment 
of control strategies and real-time data processing [2]. The 
Smart Grid involves all the operations of a system such as 
generation, transmission and distribution. The Smart Grid 
combines all the power generation resources such as solar 
energy, Wind Energy, Nuclear power, Wind power, 
Thermal Power etc.  
   Figure 1 represents the basic structure of a Smart 
Grid. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1: Basic Structure of a Smart Grid 
 
 A Smart Grid takes its source of generation from 
various power generation resources like both renewable 
and non-renewable. The renewable resource includes 
solar energy, wind energy, hydraulic power etc where as 
the non-renewable energy resources include conventional 
power systems such as nuclear power, fossil fuel etc. The 
usage and implementation of Smart grids is high that most 
of the countries shows interest in the inclusion of smart 
grids in their infrastructure. A Smart Grid in turn consists 
of Micro Grids which will be separate modules to produce 
energy from renewable energy sources and non-renewable 
energy sources. 
 An example to be considered here is the “Puducherry 
Smart Grid Pilot Project”. The project is implemented by 
the Government of Puducherry, India and Power Grid 
Corporation of India Limited. The project is being 
implemented with the objectives [3] of having a common 
sharable platform, help the consumers reduce their 
electricity bills, user friendly interface and balance the 
demand/supply chain. 
The Smart Grid is a major thrust area in which several 
ongoing researches are done. Many countries have started 
implementing the Smart Grid to add to their existing 
power grid to increase the production of electricity. 
Especially the European countries and United States have 
large number of projects implemented using smart grids.

III. BIG DATA ANALYTICS 
 
 The Big Data Analytics is a field which deals with 
data which are high in volume, velocity and variety. 
When the data to be analyzed is high in volume (i.e in 
Petabyte, Exabyte or Brontobyte), the velocity is high and 
the variety is also present then the usage of Big Data 
analytics becomes mandatory. Big Data Analytics 
comprises of distributed file systems framework such as 
Hadoop, Mahout, a multi- user database to handle huge 
amount of data such as Cassandra, MongoDB, HBase and 
a query language namely HiveQL. These software are 
open source in nature from Apache Foundation.  
 The big data analytics can be used in our smart grids 
to store the temperature history of a place, user demands, 
production data etc. The data can be stored in cloud 
environment and processing can be done. 
 
A.  Hadoop 
 
The Apache Hadoop is a framework which helps in 
distributed processing of large data sets. Hadoop can be 
scaled up from one server to thousands of machines with 
local computation. The Apache Hadoop Library is 
designed in such a way to handle failures and provide 
reliable service to the customers. Hadoop uses the concept 
of MapReduce. The MapReduce framework consists of 
single master and one slave node per cluster.

Figure 2: Hadoop Distributed File System Architecture  
 
 The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) [4] 
follows master/slave architecture. A HDFS cluster 
consists of a Name Node and a master server that 
supervises the file system namespace. A Data node is 
present to manage the storage in the cluster. In HDFS a 
file is split into one or more blocks. These blocks are in 
turn stored in the Data Nodes. The Name Node handles 
the namespace operations such as opening, closing and 
renaming directories. The Name Node also takes care of 
the mapping of blocks to the Data Nodes. The above 
architecture gives an idea about the working of the 
Hadoop Distributed Files System.  
 
B.  Cassandra 
 Cassandra is an open source distribution DBMS 
which was designed The Cassandra database is used to 
store large data sets. The Cassandra also support cloud 
infrastructure making it to suit for our smart grid 
implementation. Cassandra is in use at Netflix, eBay, 
Twitter, Reddit etc. Cassandra has a proven history of 
reliability as it does not have a single point of failure. As 
the CAP Theorem also known as Brewer’s Theorem 
states no distributed computing system can have all of 
three values Consistency, Availability and Partitioning 
Tolerance [5]. Cassandra takes the two values Availability 
and Partitioning Tolerance. The Cassandra database can 
be used in our smart grid to store the temperature data, 
user demand and supply. 
 
C.  Hive 
 
 Apache Hive data warehouse software is used to 
query large datasets which are stored in distributed 
environment. Hive uses a simple SQL-like query 
language called QL to query the databases. MapReduce 
concept can also be implemented with Hive. Hive consists 
of two components namely Hcatalog and WebHcat. 
Hcatalog is a table which allows the users to easily write 
data on the grid. WebHcat provides a service to run 
Hadoop MapReduce, Pig, and Hive using a HTTP 
interface [6]. 
  
IV. FORMATION OF A SMART GRID 
 
  The traditional electric grid can be replaced with 
a smart grid. A smart grid consist of sensors, actuators, 
smart meters, distributed management system, decision 
support system etc [7]. The smart grid formation is done 
by identifying the different resources of power generation 
such as solar energy, wind energy, fossil fuel etc.

 The traditional electric grid can be transformed by 
placing a smart grid which is bidirectional that it balances 
the load between the consumer and the producer. Smart 
Grid is of high usage when it comes to the efficient usage 
of power. Smart meters are fixed in the smart grid to 
monitor the consumer requirements and measure the 
resource produced. The load balancing is done by the 
smart grid by transferring the load from low demand grid 
to high demand grid. The production and storage of power 
is monitored by the smart grid to enable/disable the 
production depending upon the demand. 
 The user can also calculate the usage requirements 
and switch between the peak hours to regular hours for 
power requirements. The smart homes are helpful for the 
consumers to keep track of their monthly usage and cut 
down their monthly electric bills.  
 
V. A CLOUD-BASED ARCHITECTURE 
 
 The smart grid consists of components such as smart 
meters, sensors, decision support systems etc to achieve 
the goal of making the conventional electric grid to 
behave “smart”. The cloud based architecture discussed in 
the paper will contain the inclusion of big data analytics 
to analyze the historic data, the consumer usage history 
and predict the production of power from various 
resources. 
  A cloud computing has various different definitions [8], 
the one such definition is [9] 
  
 “Cloud computing is a model for enabling ubiquitous, 
convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of 
configurable computing resources that can be rapidly 
provisioned and released with minimal management effort 
or service provider interaction”  
 The cloud computing environment provides various 
services models such as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), 
Network as a Service (NaaS), Platform as a Service 
(PaaS) and Software as a Service (SaaS). There are 
different kinds of cloud deployments such as private 
cloud, public cloud, community cloud, hybrid cloud, 
distributed cloud etc [10]. A cloud- based architecture can 
be used with the big data analytics in the smart grid to 
efficiently balance the load in power production and 
supply. The advantages of the three technologies viz., 
smart grid, big data analytics and cloud computing are 
pooled together to produce an improved version of smart 
grid to perform the following functionalities, 
    
• Analyze the historic weather data and predict the 
energy production. 
• Analyze the consumer behavior (power usage) 
patterns to predict the demand in advance. 
• Keep track of the energy production from various 
sources and take decision of switching between 
the high/low priority demands. 
• Balance the load with the demand/supply chain. 
• The storage/transfer of the generated power to be 
done efficiently. 
 
 A cloud-based smart grid [11],[12] will use the micro 
grids to compute the task of storing the historic weather 
data and its architecture will contain a node storing the 
weather data and the smart meters working on the 
demand-response system to access the data to take 
decision.

 The above proposed architecture consists of a smart 
grid in which the other mandatory electronic components 
are available and apart from it the HDFS is included. The 
architecture consists of database such as historic weather 
data, consumer behavior pattern, supply and demand 
details. Each time the system predicts the demand and 
calculates the supply based on the historic weather data 
and consumer behavior patterns. The data are stored in 
cloud based Cassandra Database. To manage the storage 
and retrieval of the data the system uses the Hadoop 
Distributed File System. The HDFS takes care of

distributing the storage to nodes in racks. The processing 
is done using the Map/Reduce concept. The smart grid in 
the proposed architecture uses a prediction algorithm to 
predict the demand and supply. The system uses a 
distributed environment in which the energy resources 
(renewable and non-renewable) are distributed; the 
consumers such as home, industries are also in a 
distributed environment. The proposed architecture of 
implementing big data analytics will be suitable for the 
smart grid environment.  
 
 
 
VI. CONCLUSION 
 
  In this paper, we have dealt with the efficient 
planning of power production and distribution. The 
implementation and usage of smart grids have increased 
now days. The paper has suggested architecture to 
implement big data analytics and cloud architecture in the 
smart grids to make them even better. The proposed 
architecture is a proposal and the implementation of the 
smart grid is in process.  
 
 
FUTURE WORK 
  
 The future work deals with the implementation of the 
architecture with few connected smart grids and storing 
the weather data in cloud based databases and using the 
big data analytics to calculate the user demand and 
supply.
