Abstract— This work introduces a novel methodology for 
human face recognition based on lattice computing kNN 
classification techniques applied on thermal infrared images. 
Novel feature extraction and knowledge-representation engage 
populations of orthogonal moments represented by intervals’ 
numbers, or INs for short. Preliminary experimental results 
compare well with the results by alternative classifiers as well as 
with alternative feature extraction techniques from the literature. 
We point out the far-reaching potential of the proposed 
techniques to big data applications.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The problem of human face recognition has attracted a lot 
of attention in various applications including video surveillance 
[1], human-machine interaction [2], computer vision [3], etc. 
Even though successful results have been reported extensively, 
the proposed systems are, in general, characterized by a 
remarkably poor performance under different illumination 
conditions. Note that “illumination” as well as “occlusion” 
constitute significant difficulties for face recognition, 
especially in non-structured environments. 
A promising approach for face recognition, especially 
under varying illumination conditions, is based on thermal 
infrared images. The latter images represent a face temperature 
distribution, that is an advantage for both illumination-invariant 
and robust-to-occlusion face recognition, even in the dark [4]. 
Despite the potential advantages of temperature patterns in face 
recognition problems, the high cost of infrared cameras has 
discouraged the widespread use of thermal images in the past. 
Nevertheless, the ongoing growth of the semiconductor 
industry has resulted in an affordable drop of infrared cameras’ 
cost as well as an increase of microprocessor speed towards 
enabling the proliferation of thermal infrared images in human 
face recognition applications of scale. 
This work proposes a human face recognition system that 
carries out the following four information-processing tasks:  
#1. Image acquisition, #2. Face localization, #3. Feature 
extraction, and #4. Classification, as described next. 
The “image acquisition” task #1 is carried out by the 
camera hardware without any user intervention. The remaining 
three tasks are carried out by user-designed software. More 
specifically, the “face localization” task #2 carries out stable 
or, equivalently, robust face localization in the sense that it 
clearly separates the face from the background on an image. 
The “feature extraction” task #3 is carried out here using 
orthogonal moments [5], [6]. To the best of our knowledge, 
this is the first time that orthogonal moments are employed 
with thermal infrared images, in particular for human face 
recognition. Finally, the “classification” task #4 is carried out 
using techniques from the lattice computing framework 
outlined next. 
Lattice Computing (LC) was initially defined as “the 
collection of Computational Intelligence tools and techniques 
that either make use of lattice operators inf and sup for the 
construction of the computational algorithms or exploit Lattice 
Theory for language representation and reasoning” [7]. Recent 
work has extended the meaning of LC to denote “an evolving 
collection of tools and methodologies that process lattice 
ordered data including logic values, numbers, sets, symbols, 
graphs, etc” [8]. LC techniques have been used successfully in 
a number of applications including robot localization [9], 
industrial dispensing [10], structure identification [11], shape 
recognition [12], human facial expression recognition [8], 
fingerprint classification [13], image classification [14] storage 
and recall of color images [15], etc. The LC techniques 
proposed here for face classification engage a distance function 
in the metric lattice of Intevals’ Numbers (INs) [11], [13], [16], 
[17] by a kNN (with k=1) minimum distance classifier. 
The novelties of this work include, first, the employment of 
(orthogonal) moment features as pattern descriptors of thermal 
infrared face images and, second, the engagement of granular 
kNN LC techniques for human face recognition where an IN is 
used as a “meta-representation” of a population of moment 
features. The reported experimental results are promising. 
More specifically, the proposed methodology achieves clearly 
higher classification rates compared to alternative classifiers 
from the literature. 
The paper is organized as follows. Section II details the 
proposed face recognition methodology. Section III presents 
experimental results comparatively with alternative methods as 
well as alternative feature extraction techniques from the 
literature. Finally, section IV concludes by summarizing our 
contribution and discussing potential future work. 
II. THE PROPOSED METHODOLOGY 
The proposed methodology carries out three information-
 processing tasks, namely face localization, feature extraction 
and classification, as described in this section. 
A. Face Localization 
As soon as a thermal infrared image is acquired, the human 
face is localized in order to remove irrelevant image content. 
This step is crucial because it specifies the part of an image 
where features are to be computed during subsequent steps. 
Would the aforementioned image part include either irrelevant 
or trivial content then face recognition might deteriorate 
significantly, even fail. 
Face localization on conventional images is typically 
carried out either by the Viola-Jones face detector [18] or by 
alternative face detectors from the literature. However, the 
aforementioned solutions typically fail with infrared images 
due to the high textured nature of the thermal infrared images. 
More specifically, the aforementioned detectors work well with 
face images where the eyes, mouth and nose regions are clearly 
discernible. Nevertheless, the situation with a typical thermal 
infrared face image (Fig. 1) is quite different. 
Taking into account the aforementioned difficulties, a new 
face localization method is proposed here, especially for 
thermal infrared face images, in five steps: 
1. Image Conversion to Gray-scale: The acquired image, 
coded in the RGB color space, is converted to gray-scale 
format. Such a conversion removes useless color 
information by transforming temperature distribution to 
texture. In particular, the following formula is employed: 
Gray-scale = 0.2989*R + 0.5870*G + 0.1140*B 
2. Image Binarization: The gray-scale face image, produced 
in the previous step, is converted to a binary image towards 
separating the foreground (useful face information) from 
the background (useless information). In particular, the 
Otsu binarization [19] method is applied to calculate a 
suitable threshold value which is then used to produce the 
binary image by hard thresholding.

3. Morphological Opening and Center of Mass Computation: 
The binary image of the previous step is morphologically 
opened by applying erosion, followed by dilation 
morphological operators [20] towards removing isolated 
image parts. The structure element is selected big enough 
so as to retain only the human face part of the image. Upon 
successful completion of the opening operation step, only a 
single segment of the initial binary image remains. Then, 
the center of mass of the aforementioned binary segment is 
computed by geometrical moments techniques [21] using 
the following formulas: 
10 01

is the (n+m)th order geometric moment of the M?N pixels 
face image f(x,y); n and m are nonnegative integers, i.e. n, 
m?{0,1,2,…}. 
4. Ellipse Masking: The center of mass computed in the 
previous step is used as the center of an ellipse masked on 
the face region. We remark that the major and minor axes 
of an ellipse are selected by trial-and-error. Note that since 
all human faces share a similar “oval” shape, masking the 
face with an ellipse discards irrelevant face parts such as 
hair, ears, etc. 
5. Face Cropping: The image region, already masked by an 
ellipse in the previous step, is used to select the 
corresponding part from the original face image. The latter 
part is finally cropped towards using it for feature 
extraction. The size of a cropped image is 128?128 pixels. 
Fig. 2 displays the output image after each one of the above 
five steps, respectively, for the infrared face image in Fig.1. In 
conclusion, the output of the “face localization” task #2 is a 
face region where redundant information (e.g., background, 
hair, body torso, etc.) has been removed. 
B. Feature Extraction 
We have engaged a feature extraction method on a thermal 
infrared image localized face so as to achieve dimensionality 
reduction while, at the same time, preserving discriminatory 
face characteristics. Therefore, we carried out feature 
extraction by computing orthogonal moments on a cropped 
face image (Fig.2(e)). We remark that orthogonal moments are 
known image descriptors, especially effective in pattern 
recognition applications, with a capacity to encode image 
content with minimum redundancy [22]. 
We experimented with two families of moments, namely 
Zernike moments (ZMs) and Tchebichef moments (TMs) 
defined in the continuous and discrete coordinate space, 
respectively [21], [22].

C. Classification 
A classifier here was designed in the context of LC. The 
corresponding mathematical background [23] is outlined next. 
1) INs Meta-Representation: Our interest focuses on a 
complete lattice of Intervals' Numbers (INs) defined as 
follows. 
 
Definition 1. Let I denote the set of intervals on the real 
line including the empty set. An Intervals’ Number (IN) is a 
function F: [0,1]?I which satisfies 
1 21 2
 1) .
 2) [0,1] : .?
 ?
 ≥ ? ?
 ? ? =?
 h h
 h P
 h P
 h h F F
 P F F
  (3) 
The set F of INs, is a (metric) lattice with cardinality ?1, 
where ?1 is the cardinality of the set ?  of real numbers. The 
lattice order relation ?  in F is defined as 
[ ]( )0,1 :? ? ? ?? h hF G h F G  (4) 
An algorithm for inducing an IN from a population of data 
samples [10], [12] is described next. Consider a vector 
?
 x  of 
real data samples, e.g. 1 n= ( , , )
 ? …x xx . Two vector ?x  entries 
xi, xj are called successive iff there is no other entry xk, 
k?{1,…,n} such that < <? ?i j k i jx x x x x , where ? and 
? are the min and max operators, respectively. 
A strictly-increasing, cumulative real function 0:
 +? ? ?c  
is computed from the entries of vector x
 ?
  by, first, defining 
( ) { }{ } { }1 : 1,...,   and , 1,...,= ? ≤ ?i j j ic x x j n x x i nn  (5) 
where S  denotes the cardinality of the set S ; finally, function 
0:
 +? ? ?c  is defined by straight-line connecting two points 
(xi,c(xi)) and (xj,c(xj)), where xi, xj are successive entries of 
vector 
?
 x . Obviously, there is a unique real number x0.5 such 
that c(x0.5)=0.5. In conclusion, an IN is calculated from 
function c(.) such that for values less-than or equal-to x0.5 the 
corresponding IN envelope function equals 2c(x), whereas for 
values larger than x0.5 the corresponding IN envelope function 
equals 2(1-c(x)). 
In practice, we represent an IN envelope by 32 equally 
spaced intervals from h=0 to h=1 included. It turns out that any 
population of data samples in vector 
?
 x  can be represented by 
32 intervals stored in a 32?2 size matrix. This is, potentially, a 
very useful property for the IN representation because it 
provides a fixed size “meta-representation” for any data vector ?
 x  length. In other words, a single IN can represent any data 
population. Therefore, INs emerge as an instrument for dealing 
with big (numeric) data including satellite data [24] as well as 
multi-dimensional data [25]. Note that an IN represents all 
order data statistics [8], [10], [11]. 
The representation of a distribution of data samples (e.g., 
image moments) by an IN enables the employment of 
established, useful mathematical instruments for measuring a 
distance as well as for calculating a (fuzzy) degree of partial 
order of different data distributions [8], [13], [23]. 
2) LC-Minimum Distance Classifier (LC-MDC): A 
traditional minimum distance classifier (MDC) assigns a 
testing data sample (S) to the class (k*) represented by a 
prototype pattern *kP  such that *kP  corresponds to the 
minimum distance; symbolically, 
( ){ }arg min ,k
 k
 k Dist P S? =  (6) 
where Pk is the prototype pattern of class k and Dist(.,.) is a 
distance function that quantifies the “apartness” of Pk and S. 
In our computational experiments below, both a class 
prototype pattern Pk and a testing data sample S are in the 
Cartesian product FN, where F is the lattice of INs. Recall that 
a metric distance function 0:
 +? ? ?dF F F  is defined [13] as 
( ) ( )

 , ,= ∫ h hd F G d F G dhF I  (7) 
where function 0:

moreover, functions 0:

III. COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
The recognition capacity of the proposed LC-MDC 
classifier was studied as described in this section. Our 
proposed algorithms were implemented in software on the 
MATLAB platform executed on an Intel Core i5-2410M with 
2.3 GHz CPU as well as 8 GB memory. 
A. Benchmark Dataset 
The Terravic Facial IR benchmark dataset [26] was used to 
evaluate the performance of alternative pattern recognition 
schemes. Since this dataset includes images of 20 persons with 
a variable number of images per person, a subset of this dataset 
was employed. More specifically, 70 images were selected 
randomly for each one of the first 10 persons resulting in a total 
of 700 images. The images are in 8-bit format with 320?240 
pixels size and variable angle of view (front /left /right) in an 
indoor environment. For instance, images of the first four 
persons in this dataset are shown in Fig.3. 
B. Data Preprocessing 
The applied structure element for the opening operator was 
selected, by trial-and-error, as a 40?40 pixels rectangle, that is 
the smallest detectable face region. The remaining 
experimental settings were defined per case, as detailed below. 
C. Comparative Experimental Results 
In order to evaluate the capacity of our proposed LC-MDC 
classifier we carried out a number of comparative 
computational experiments with alternative feature descriptors 
as well as with alternative classifiers. 
 
Fig. 3. Sample images from the Terravic Facial IR benchmark dataset.

First, regarding alternative feature descriptors, we 
considered Local Binary Patterns (LBP), that is a popular 
texture descriptor used in facial recognition applications [27], 
[28], [29]. More specifically, here we used LBP descriptors for 
the temperature distribution on infrared faces. Note that LBP 
descriptors are typically employed in the literature in two 
different configurations including, first, the entire image and, 
second, nonoverlapping blocks covering the entire image; in 
the latter case LBP histograms of blocks are concatenated 
resulting in a single histogram, namely LBP-C. In addition, we 
considered ZMs as well as TMs feature descriptors. Overall, 
the feature vectors for comparison included moments ZMs (36 
features - up to order 10), moments TMs (36 features - up to 
order 5), uniform LBP (59 features) and LBP-C texture 
descriptors computed in a neighborhood of radius 1 and 8 
samples. Note that each image was partitioned in four 64?64 
pixels size blocks resulting in 59?4 = 236 features. 
Second, regarding alternative classifiers, we considered 
three versions of the MDC classifier using three different 
distances, namely Euclidean, Chi Square (?2) and Manhattan, 
respectively, defined as follows.

two vectors [ ]1 2 3, , ,..., np p p p=p , [ ]1 2 3, , ,..., ns s s s=s  in the 
space ( )0+? n . In our simulations vectors p and s correspond to 
feature vectors ZMs, TMs, LBP and LBP-C.

(c)                                (d) 
Third, regarding alternative classification methodologies, 
we considered additional face recognition schemes, as 
explained below, whose application on the Terravic Facial IR 
dataset has been reported in the literature [28], [30]. 
In our classification experiments, the first image of each 
person in the dataset was used as a training datum, whereas all 
the remaining images were used as testing data. Hence, 10 
feature vectors (prototypes) were used as “training exemplars”, 
whereas the remaining 690 feature vectors were used for 
testing. Regarding, in particular, the LC-MDC classifier each 
feature vector was represented by a single IN. 
The recognition performance, that is the percentage of 
correctly classified sample images over the total number of 
sample images for testing are summarized in Table I, for all 
feature descriptors as well as for all MDC classifier types. 
Table I demonstrates that moment features produce better 
classification rates (between 2% - 11%) compared to LBP 
features, for all MDC classifiers. Moreover, the combination of 
moment features with LC-based MDC using INs outperforms 
any other classifier. In particular, Tchebichef moments (TMs) 
produce the best classification result (94.74%) outperforming 
by over 7% alternative MDC schemes. Note that the optimal 
parameter values in (10), that produced the best classification 
rate (94.74%) in Table I, were (A, ?, ?) = (1.197, 0.025, 10.00). 
D. Additional Experiments 
Given the superiority of the TMs features as demonstrated 
above, we further studied how the number of (moments) 
features effects the classification performance of the LC-MDC. 
To this end additional experiments were carried out for TMs 
features and the LC-MDC classifier. In particular, TMs 
moments of order up to 1 /2 /3 ... /10 were computed resulting 
in (order+1)2 number of features in each case. Then the TMs 
moments were used to recognize the same faces as in the above 
experiments. The corresponding recognition rates for each 
TMs feature vector length are summarized in Table II. 
Table II demonstrates that the length of the feature 
descriptor vector may have a significant impact on the 
recognition capability. More specifically, Table II shows that 
an optimum vector length of 16 TMs feature descriptors 
produces 95.43% recognition rate; that is a performance 
slightly higher (around 1%) which also corresponds to less than 
half the length of the best performing descriptor length (36) in 
Table I. We point out that our interest is in both effective 
feature descriptors and small length towards achieving high 
classification rate with low complexity. 
E. Discussion 
Table III displays results by alternative face recognition 
schemes from the literature as well as the aforementioned best 
95.43% performance of the proposed LC-MDC classifier. In 
particular, in [30] a recognition performance of 85% has been 
reported on the same dataset using Center of Gravity (CoG) 
points as features and a conventional MDC. Whereas, in [28] a 
maximum recognition accuracy of 94.11% has been reported 
using LBP or Haar wavelet features with PCA and either a 
Neural Network (NN) or a conventional MDC on a subset of 
the Terravic Facial IR benchmark data set. 
Extensive computational experiments here have 
demonstrated that the recognition performance clearly depends 
on the selected features as well as on the selected metric of a 
MDC classifier. A study of the free parameters including the 
(variable) length of the feature vectors might result in an 
improvement in classification performance. Nevertheless, such 
a study is beyond the scope of this work. Therefore, fixed 
feature vector lengths have been considered here.

IV. CONCLUSION 
This work has demonstrated promising experimental results 
regarding the application of LC classification techniques for 
human face recognition based on orthogonal moments features 
induced from thermal infrared images. More specifically, we 
recorded a clearly higher classification performance of our 
proposed techniques (TMs combined with LC-MDC) 
compared to the performance of alternative schemes. We 
attribute the success of our proposed classification scheme to 
the synergy of INs, which can represent all order data statistics, 
with orthogonal moment descriptors. 
Future work plans include, first, a study of the effect of 
various parameters of our proposed classification scheme, 
second, the effect of varying environmental conditions (such as 
illumination) and, third, an extensive comparison with 
alternative classifiers from the literature. Additional plans 
include “big data” applications, where INs may represent large 
data populations [24], [25].
