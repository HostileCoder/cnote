ABSTRACT — Privacy is a major concern in management of 
Big Data, especially for datasets that contain sensitive personal 
information. A model that is widely used to protect privacy is k-
 anonymity, which can be generally defined as a clustering 
method in which any record in a dataset is indistinguishable from 
at least (k-1) other records in the same dataset. Most of the 
approaches to k-anonymity suffer from huge information loss by 
abstraction of continuous numerical and categorical attributes 
that have a hierarchical structure. It is difficult to use 
conventional k-anonymity in actual internet services because of 
computational complexity and value loss from loss of information."
 This paper presents a k-anonymity method based on the SEM 
(Search Engine Marketing) price of personal information for 
practical use in Big Data management services. We evaluate k-
 anonymized qualitative data with SEM price, which is a 
quantitative indicator. This approach makes it possible to 
calculate only the necessary data and keep a k-anonymized level. 
Application the method to actual data shows that there is a point 
at which a high value can be achieved for both k-anonymity and 
SEM price. Developing this method will enable efficient storage 
of personal data and the application of k-anonymity to actual 
Internet services.

I.  Introduction 
A result of increasing awareness of the need to protect 
personal information in recent years is the high cost of storing 
and maintaining personal information (microdata) and the risk 
of data leaks borne by companies that provide communication 
services as well as companies in other industries. 
Businesses and other organizations guard against data 
leaks by continuous updating of security systems to meet 
frequently-changing standards (SOC, PCIDSS, and ISO27001, 
etc.) at great cost and commitment of resources.  
Anonymization is one promising way to safely distribute 
personal information. An approach called k-anonymity [2] in 
particular has been well-studied as a good means of evaluating 
security level, but it has been used in very few actual internet 
or marketing services. Examples of actual use include medical 
information provision tools that use optimal lattice 
anonymization [5][9] and public information provision tools 
that use the ?-argus algorithm. [5] 
Such services are not as easy to use as ordinary Internet 
services, because the types of data and how the data can be 
used are fixed and immediate responses cannot be provided. 
One contributing problem is the large number of attribute 
combinations. Also, implementation of k-anonymity requires 
the calculation of a huge number of attribute combinations 
(identifiers, quasi-identifiers, sensitive attributes, non-sensitive 
attributes, etc.). Because important personal information tends 
to have many important attributes, the complexity of k-
 anonymity increases with the number of combinations of data 
required. Also, because personal information is constantly 
changing, a k-anonymity method that allows periodic 
recalculation is needed. 
A practical service that uses k-anonymity must have a 
response time of about 2 seconds. It is well-known that 
Internet customers demand that pages be displayed within 
three seconds. Research done in 2012 has shown that over 
40% of e-commerce site customers consider switching to other 
sites when a page fails to display within 2 seconds. [3] 
The relationship between the response time and the size of 
the database is shown in Fig. 1, where the horizontal axis 
represents the number of rows of data in one database table 
and the vertical axis indicates the response time for queries. 
We investigated "count(*)" and "like” queries under the 
assumption that the queries are run as pre-processing checks 
for the entire table in a typical application.

From Fig. 1, the response time is calculated as the number 
of columns times 9.4e-09 seconds for a “like” query and the

number of columns times 3.24e-06 seconds for a “count(*)” 
query. Although server performance will continue to improve 
in the future, we should set the maximum number of 
anonymous data table rows to between 10^6 and 10^9 for 
suitable performance. 
The logical limit for computational complexity in k-
 anonymizing is the sum of the products of the numbers of data 
items for which there are two or more choices (k?2). 
Kn : Number of calculations  
An : Data attributes" "  
An(c) : Number of attribute cases 
K(1) = A1(c) + A2(c) + A3(c) +… Am(c) 
K(2) = (A1(c) *A2(c) ) + (A2(c) *A3(c) )…  
… 
K(n) = ?( A1(c) , A2(c) , A3(c) … An(c))  
Figure 2. Calculating the number of k-anonymity patterns 
Because the number of multiplication operations increases 
with the number of attribute combinations, the computational 
complexity increases exponentially with the number of 
personal information attributes.  
Another problem is the lack of criteria for measuring the 
value of anonymity patterns. In particular, there is no 
qualitative evaluator for free-description type qualitative 
attributes. Even for a relatively quantitative attribute such as 
age, there are three patterns for abstracting the data into broad 
classes as listed below. 
1. Mathematical: Automatic classification by analysis tools 
(histograms, Sturges' formula, Pareto analysis, etc.) 
2. Marketing: Classification by general concept or QID 
(teen/20's/30's  or school grade, etc.) 
3. Limited application: Classification according to particular 
marketing needs (e.g., “QID: over 20 years old” is required by 
alcoholic beverage makers) 
Even the above three patterns allow for unlimited 
classification schemes, so it is impossible to know what best 
pattern meets any particular purpose. It is also impossible to 
know in advance what classification needs might arise in our 
society.  
As the amount of data to be processed increases, there is a 
greater division of labor between engineers that process the 
data and marketers that use the data in analysis. That can 
result in a large recognition gap between the marketers, who 
put utility first, and the k-anonymization engineers, who put 
security first, and situations arise in which the technician may 
remove items that marketers need. Such problems occur 
because there are no criteria for judging the suitability of 
methods for abstracting sensitive attributes. 
To apply k-anonymity in actual services, we must both 
reduce the computational complexity to a level that enables 
use of ordinary databases and establish some criteria for 
evaluating data abstractions without loss of usability.  
In this paper, we propose a means of reducing the 
computational complexity of k-anonymity while minimizing 
loss of data utility. We also present the results of experiments 
conducted with real service data that confirm the effectiveness 
of our method. 
II. RELATED WORK 
The k-anonymity method has been well-studied as a means 
of processing personal information so that it cannot be used to 
identify individual persons. The personal information is 
represented as attribute and value fields of records in a 
database table. Although individual attributes do not identify a 
person, there are combinations of attributes that may identify 
individuals. We call such combinations “quasi-identifiers” 
(QID). We also define “sensitive attributes” (SA), which 
should not be disclosed if a person is identified. 
If the values of QID attributes are known in an attack, they 
can be used to identify the user's record in the database and 
thus to discover the values of sensitive attributes. One known 
way to prevent that is to generalize the QID attribute values to 
more abstract values. Then, if there at least k records that are 
identified by the QID, the table satisfies k-anonymity [2]. 
The main algorithms used to implement k-anonymity in 
applications for anonymizing government and medical data 
include Datafly [4] [7] and ?-Argus[4] [8]. Those algorithms 
suppress and generalize data so that the number of occurrences 
is no greater than k. Most of the algorithms recode and 
generalize  the data of each dataset (SA/QID) into anonymized 
attributes by reducing the number of occurrences of 
identifying combinations of data to the value of k or less. 
Recoding can be broadly categorized as local suppression and 
global recoding. Local suppression rewrites the value of the 
attribute itself. Global recoding rewrites data to change the 
overall occurrence rate of attributes. Global recoding involves 
so many possible changes that it is difficult to find the correct 
method efficiently. 
Evaluation criteria for k-anonymity are mainly based on 
the level of information loss. If the value of k is defined as the 
level of security, there will always be a conflict with the 
current use of information loss to evaluate anonymity. 
These criteria are also affected by social situations in 
different areas, such as customer complaints or religious 
doctrine. For example, in the case of the “T point toolbar” in 
Japan in 2012, many users complained that toolbar provisions 
relating to the collection of personal information were not 
clearly evident and the company was forced to change their 
business policy.[11] The doubt and questions from users 
caused by such cases affect other companies in the industry as 
well, forcing changes in business practices and reducing 
business opportunities. 
In the future, the government will continue to specify legal 
guidelines regarding security, so even if the value of k meets 
the criteria established by law at a particular time, changes in 
the criteria may result in the occurrence of a major security 
incident.  Flexible response to changing levels of security for 
personal information is required to meet user needs. 
Regarding the level of information loss, too, there is a 
clear gap between the security level that the majority of users 
considers good and the level desired by marketers in actual 
1012
practice. Information loss cannot serve as the criterion for 
evaluating the level gap between user needs and marketer 
needs. We think the index for evaluation in k-anonymity 
should be a concept that varies according to marketing and 
customer value rather than the amount of information loss. 
Having indicators that can be used to evaluate the security 
and benefits of k-anonymity in actual business applications 
would allow application of k-anonymity in ordinary internet 
services. 
III. A k-anonymity based on the Search 
Engine Marketing Value of Personal 
Information 
We suggest that change in information value after k-
 anonymity processing should be evaluated using the SEM 
(Search Engine Marketing) price. SEM has been established as 
a standard in qualitative marketing. The SEM indicator can be 
used to measure changes in the marketing value of data. 
Also, because  the current monetary value of SEM is 
linked to current user preferences, the value is constantly 
changing. For example, we usually do not need Christmas gift 
information in the summer vacation season. If we eliminate 
unnecessary seasonal information, we can reduce waste in 
computation and data archiving. 
The SEM auction is a contest for the order of ad display 
rather than a contest for a single product. Therefore, the 
display position is determined by the relationship between the 
bids of companies. A lower bid results in a lower display 
position. These prices are established only when the buyer (ad 
clicker) and seller (ad agency and company) are both present. 
Ads that have never been clicked by a user in the past will be 
priced at zero. 
Very many businesses now use SEM, so the SEM price 
has become an index of economic conditions because it 
indicates what is selling in various industries. 
Table 1. Change in data “price” and “k” 
When converting the value of data into SEM prices, we 
encountered several situations in which the anonymized data 
had a higher value than the original data. An empirical 
example of change in value between original data and 
anonymized data is presented in Table 1. 
Detailed data is not necessarily good data. Good data is 
often that which is simple and easily used. Therefore, data is 
abstracted to the level of highest economic value. 
Generalization reduces attributes, so the number of users per 
attribute will increase, and security also increases. This is 
compatible with the concept of the security level of “k-
 anonymity”. Having an attribute dictionary that has a high 
level of both security and utility should enable application of 
k-anonymity to ordinary internet services with very fast 
response. 
 First, we try to evaluate each attribute. If we want to 
advertise to all users that have attribute S, the price is 
calculated as advertising cost for the attribute times number of 
persons that have the attribute. 
We obtained the advertising cost from an SEM tool and 
multiplied the unit price by the number of people that have the 
attribute to get to get the total marketing price for each 
attribute. We then summed the values to obtain the total value 
for all of the attributes. This “price” indicator does not 
represent the business profit, but simply indicates data priority. 
S(e):Attribute S value  
S(k):k-anonymized S value  
s1, s2, ... sn : QID 
c1, c2, ... cn : number of QID 
e1, e2, ... en : SEM price of QID 
" s1(e) = c1 * e1      
" s2(e) = c2 * e2                    Multiply the SEM Price 
" ...                                       and number of people 
" sn(e) = cn * en       
?Amount of Attribute Value 
   S(e) = ?{ ci * ei} 
?Reduction rate of k-anonymized data Value 
   M(k) = S(k) / S(e) 
 Figure 5. Calculation of change in value 
This can prevent the removal high-value options among 
the attributes as noise because of a low incidence rate. If 
anonymization automatically removes items that have high 
marketing value, the price impact will be very high even if the 
frequency of occurrence is low. Such removal can be stopped 
by checking the prices for a certain level of reduction.

?Preparation 
We entered the current word group and generalized word 
group into the SEM tool, and then calculated the SEM prices 
of those words. (make table: P1,P2…) 
?Anonymizing procedure 
1. Use the price data and the number of occurrences of 
each data item to determine the total value of the attribute. 
2. Store the attribute price in the database and list the 
generalized words in descending price order. 
3. Copy the user data to a temporary table and rewrite the 
word as a generalized word that has a higher price. 
4. Check the anonymity level and compare the value of 
total advertising if the level is less than or equal to anonymous 
state 2.

IV. Evaluation of a k-anonymity method 
based on SEM price of personal information 
using real data 
In an experiment, we applied the method described above 
to convert actual data to the 2-anonymous state, in which 
personal identity could not be determined, and checked the 
change in data value. The properties of the actual data are 
listed in Table 5. 
We used the Google SEM tool to determine the unit prices 
at October 19, 2012. (https://adwords.google.com/) 
 
Table 5. Anonymized data values 
We generalized the data by the following procedure. We 
conducted experiments in which data was stored as 
anonymous data recoded in the form of highest price. The 
values of the data determined by this method are presented in 
Table 5. When the data was put into the k-anonymous state by 
1014
this method and generalized to the form of least loss in utility 
value, there was a 60.6% change in value." We then removed 
the ID (irreversible data) connection to the original data to 
complete the anonymization. 
V. Relationship between k-anonymity and 
marketing value 
We conducted experiments in which we used this data to 
create multiple data generalization patterns for different values 
of k to investigate the changes in value. The five patterns of 
generalization for the age attribute are listed Table 6. 
 
Table 6. Values of the anonymized data 
The results are presented in Table 6. There is no significant 
relationship between the value (SEM price) and the security 
level (k). The generation grouping pattern has high value for 
both advertising and security. The five-year grouping has an 
advertising value of zero despite the lower loss of information. 
 
Figure 8. Results arranged in order of k value 
 
The data are arranged to compare the average marketing 
value and the standard deviation of the k value in Fig. 8. No 
significant relationship between the marketing value and 
security level (k value) is seen, so we conclude that there is no 
significant relationship between marketing value and security 
standards. We can therefore use the marketing price of the 
data evaluate security and utility. 
VI. Conclusion 
The results of our experiments show that the SEM price 
can serve as an indicator of the marketing value of data after 
k-anonymity processing. We can therefore prioritize the 
generalization of actual data. We also found no relationship 
between the anonymity level (k) and data utility, so if there is 
a qualitative criterion for evaluation, there is a point at which 
high levels of both value and security are possible. 
We have begun the development of a price database for 
anonymized word data. We believe that establishing a clear 
priority based on data analysis value in that way will enable 
implementation of a mechanism for automatic, time-sensitive 
optimal anonymization. There is also a possibility that SEM 
can be used to compose generalization patterns that can handle 
the appearance of new terms for use together with automatic 
semantic analysis. 
Determining the optimal solution for cost and security also 
makes it possible to measure the maximum value of the data. 
We can also expect a reduction in cost from the viewpoint of 
data distribution by storing high-value anonymized data in 
ordinary databases as a way to achieve operational 
independence from the original data." There are, however, 
many problems with using SEM price, some of which are 
listed below. 
1. Daily response is required to keep up with price changes. 
2. Dealing with concepts that do not have an SEM price or 
words that have the same meaning 
3. Applicability of the method to any language 
We will investigate issues such as those listed above in 
future research. We will also prepare a dictionary and criteria 
for anonymization words.
