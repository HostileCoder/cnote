Abstract—Data aggregation is a key technology in wireless 
sensor networks (WSNs), enabling WSNs to be widely used in 
many fields such as environment monitoring. It can not only 
reduce redundant data transmission during data gathering, but 
also effectively improve data accuracy. However, poor anti-
 interference ability, limited energy and other reasons existed in 
sensor nodes make data error-prone, thus affecting quality of the 
aggregation results. In this paper we propose a prediction-based 
fault-tolerant aggregation algorithm, which is implemented on a 
constructed aggregation tree. Using temporal-spatial correlation 
between data, the algorithm can distinguish different data types. 
And then we make a specific analysis of faulty data that may 
occur during data gathering and pointedly put forward different 
fault-tolerant solutions using the PSO-BPNN-based prediction 
model. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm 
can effectively predict data and exclude the impact of faulty data, 
ensuring real-time and fault-tolerant requirements.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
A wireless sensor network (WSN) is a data-centric, self-
 organizing network which can be deployed quickly. It consists 
of a large number of sensor nodes, which are low-power and 
have a short-distance communication capability. Each sensor 
periodically senses data and consumes most of energy to 
transmit and receive data. As a key technology in WSNs, data 
aggregation is a process dealing with several data to obtain 
what data are more suitable for user needs, and it can not only 
reduce redundant data transmission, but also effectively 
improve data accuracy [1, 2]. However, due to unreliability and 
instability of wireless link between nodes and a variety of 
faults including hardware errors, energy depletion and 
exception errors, nodes may become failure-prone, thereby 
reducing aggregation results accuracy. As an important 
indicator to evaluate network reliability, fault tolerance refers 
to the system’s ability to provide correct results when networks 
fail. It is a prerequisite to guarantee that networks can keep 
normal operation, critical to the validity of aggregation. 
Therefore, it is significant to explore how to increase fault 
tolerance of WSNs. 
The authors in [5] proposed DFDBW based on the 
weighted average method, DFDBW sets a credibility for each 
sensor node and synthetically judge whether a node has failed 
according to the average product of the measured value and 
credibility. Based on the weighted median method, authors in 
[6] proposed a fault-diagnosis strategy called WMFDS, which 
measures the gap between measured data to detect faults. It can 
be also applied to binary decisions and real measured values. 
Above algorithms both provide high detection accuracy and 
lower misjudgment rate, but lack specific strategies for fault 
recovery. 
Taking advantage of temporal-spatial correlation between 
measured values, literature [7] effectively excludes faulty data 
and uses the median measured values of neighbor nodes to 
estimate measured value of target, improving accuracy of 
target detection and location. Literature [8] sets a weighted 
factor for each sensor and uses the weighted average method to 
aggregate data. When a node fails or submits faulty data, this 
algorithm can adaptively reduce this node’s weight, thereby 
reducing the impact of faulty data on aggregation results to 
improve fault tolerance. But when failure rate stays high, above 
methods can not guarantee aggregation accuracy. 
Based on the Dempster-Shafer (DS) theory, authors in [9] 
proposed a fault-tolerant interval fusion method. It can not only 
ensure smaller interval estimation, but also meet local Lipschitz 
condition in certain circumstances, making fused results satisfy 
the stability requirement. Based on temporal-spatial fusion 
structure, literature [10] proposed a fault detection and 
recovery strategy. It detects faults in the fusion center, and then 
feeds the result back to local sensors by DS theory, effectively 
improving target classification accuracy. But the DS theory 
usually requires a large amount of computation, which is 
challenging for real-time demands. 
The fault-tolerant aggregation algorithm proposed in this 
paper includes construction of an aggregation tree, an anomaly 
detection mechanism and a fault-tolerant mechanism. 
Construction of a distributed aggregation tree is the basis of the 
algorithm, and then each node on the tree receives data from 
child nodes and sends them to its parent node after aggregation 
with its own data [11]. During the process, temporal-spatial 
correlation is used to synthetically judge the validity and 
integrity of data, to effectively eliminate all kinds of possible 
faults. After that, to satisfy the real-time requirement of WSNs, 
we use the PSO-BPNN-based prediction model proposed in 
[12] to predict data for fault tolerance. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: In section II, 
the network model and environmental assumptions are 
described in details, and then we present our prediction-based 
fault-tolerant aggregation algorithm in section III. In section IV, 
we compare our algorithm with other two algorithms and 
evaluate the performance of them. Finally, concluding remarks 
are made in section V.

II. NETWORK MODEL AND ENVIRONMENTAL 
ASSUMPTIONS 
In this paper, we consider a wireless sensor network 
composed of N nodes, whose communication range is r, 
uniformly and randomly distributed in an R?R monitored 
region, shown in figure 1. If the distance between node u and v 
satisfies dis(u, v)r, then they can communicate with each 
other directly; otherwise, they have to communicate with each 
other through multi-hop wireless links. A WSN can be 
modeled as an undirected graph G(Vertex, Edge), where Vertex 
is a finite set of sensor nodes, and Edge is defined as wireless 
links between nodes.

Figure 1. Network Model & Aggregation Tree 
Definition 1 Temporal-Spatial Correlation: Due to 
continuity in time of physical environment, single-node 
sampled data in the adjacent interval have a high correlation. In 
addition, due to high density of network topology, sampled 
data of neighbor sensors also have a high correlation [13, 14]. 
Definition 2 Permanent Failure: A fault is called 
Permanent Failure if a sensor node doesn’t work properly 
because of equipment damage or energy depletion. This type of 
faulty data is easily considered as events, thus affecting the 
query results. 
Definition 3 Temporary Failure: A fault is called 
Temporary Failure if a sensor node becomes low sensitivity 
because of outside interference. The frequency of occurrence of 
this type of faulty data is low and it can be easily ruled out. 
The proposed algorithm in this paper is based on the 
following three environmental assumptions: (1) Each sensor 
node in WSNs can both sense data and aggregate data. (2) 
Events are spatially correlated while faults are not spatially 
correlated. (3) The aggregation algorithm always aggregates 
multiple copies of data into one copy and amount of each copy 
is equal.

III. A PREDICTION-BASED FAULT-TOLERANT 
AGGREGATION ALGORITHM 
A. Construction of an Aggregation Tree 
The construction of a distributed aggregation tree aims to 
reduce redundant data transmission, but the optimal solution is 
equivalent to solve the problem of Steiner minimum tree which 
is NP-complete. To facilitate discussion, here we will only take 
energy consumed for data communication into account and use 
the weighted average method to aggregate data. The energy 
models for transmitting data and receiving data can be 
respectively represented by formula (1) and formula (2): 
     2,T uvE u v d u    	 	              (1) 
 ,RE u v u  	                         (2) 
where  and  are constants. duv is the distance between node u 
and v. 	(u) is the data amount transmitted from node u to node 
v. So the energy consumption of each wireless link can be 
given by: 
     22 *uv uvE e d u    	             (3) 
From assumption (1), we can know that the construction of 
an aggregation tree is to find a connected subgraph  of G, 
such that

From assumption (3), we can know . Thus 
the problem (4) can be simplified to construct a minimum 
spanning tree, and the Prim algorithm will be adopted to solve 
it.

 B. Anomaly Detection Mechanism 
In WSNs, nodal data include normal data and abnormal 
data, and abnormal data also include events and faults. It is 
fatal for WSNs to make the right decisions how to effectively 
distinguish different data types. 
Because sensed data and aggregated data share with the 
same detection mechanism, we will just discuss how to 
distinguish different sensed data types. According to the 
temporal correlation in Definition 1, the detection mechanism 
will use single-node historical data to determine whether data 
are abnormal. In general, within the range [Cmin, Cmax], (i, t) 
is statistically continuous and admits a normal distribution 
(i), 
where Cmin and Cmax can be obtained from the known 
environmental parameters [15]. So the expected value of 
sensed data can be represented as: 
    max
 min
 (i) , ,C
 C
 E i t i d    i t              (5) 
433
Thus, if |(i, t) - E(i)|, then (i, t) is normal; otherwise, it 
is abnormal, as shown in figure 2 (a). 
Definition 4 group: If node p is a one-hop neighbor node 
of i and p is not the parent node of i, p is called as a 
cooperative node of i. So the cooperative group of node i can 
be represented as     | , ,igroup p dis i p r p i PN    i . 
 
Figure 2. Data sequence collected by nodes 
Since single-node data can not accurately detect an event, 
we will further consider spatial correlation. When node i has 
detected abnormal data, i will further joint members in groupi 
to collaboratively sense, as shown in the dashed box in figure 
1. The more nodes in groupi detect abnormal data, the greater 
the probability that abnormal data is an event is. Here we 
assume that if the proportion of nodes in groupi which have 
detected abnormal data is greater than , abnormal data are 
judged to be an event and immediately transmitted to the base 
station; otherwise, abnormal data are faulty data. 
In order to better distinguish Permanent Failure and 
Temporary Failure, a counter counti is introduced to record 
times that node i has detected faulty data to determine failure 
types, and the process is described in algorithm 1. Temporary 
Failure and Permanent Failure are shown in figure 2(b) and 
figure 2(c). 
Algorithm 1. The algorithm to distinguish Permanent Failure and 
Temporary Failure 
C.  Fault-Tolerant Mechanism 
Let each sensor node in figure 1 run the anomaly detection 
mechanism. When node i communicates with PNi, if i takes no 
notice of faulty data detected, its own data and data transmitted 
from nodes on the sub-trees will completely lose. Since 
traditional methods, such as reconstructing an aggregation tree, 
discarding faulty data, data retransmission, adjusting weighting 
factors and so on, can not completely meet fault-tolerant 
requirements for different faulty data types in consideration of 
real-time and data validity, here we will combine them with the 
PSO-BPNN-based prediction model in [12] to build a fault-
 tolerant mechanism.

The feed forward back propagation neural network (BPNN) 
is widely used to extract useful information for samples. But its 
blindness of weights initialization easily results in slow 
convergence speed and stack into local infinitesimal value. The 
authors in [12] adopt particle swarm optimization (PSO) to 
optimize initial weights and threshold of BPNN to construct an 
energy-efficient prediction model, called PSO-BPNN, whose 
structure is shown in figure 3. The PSO-BPNN combines the 
fast constringency performance of BPNN with the global 
searching merit of PSO, aiming to finding out potential laws 
according to historical data to afterwards predict the test set. 
The PSO-BPNN-based prediction model is run at both node i 
and node PNi, as shown in figure 4. Only when the deviation 
between the actual and the predicted value at the node exceeds 
a certain threshold, the sampling value and new model 
parameters of node i are sent to PNi. 
As shown in figure 5, in this paper we consider fault 
tolerance for both sensed data and aggregated data and each 
node runs two mechanisms.

The fault-tolerant mechanisms will perform if there exists 
se, making the original 
dat
 ived data from node i or received data are faulty. 
Thi
 tion algorithms or data 
han
 e proposed algorithm is shown in 
any of the following three conditions. 
(1) Sensed data of node i are faulty. This is mostly due to 
the impact of physical factors or noi
 a deviate from the normal range, and we adopt the 
prediction model for sensed data to predict data to reduce 
energy consumption. Moreover if the fault is Permanent 
Failure, node i still need to send a “PERMANENT” signal to 
node PNi. 
(2) Before a single data gathering deadline, node PNi 
hasn’t rece
 s is mostly the results of node failure or a variety of outside 
factors during transmission, making data packets fail to reach 
the destination or lose during transmission. Instead of data 
retransmission in consideration of energy consumption and 
delay, node PNi predicts data of node i by the prediction 
model for aggregated data of node i and lets counti plus one. 
Node i becomes permanent failure if node PNi receives a 
“PERMANENT” signal or counti?, and node PNi informs 
the base station to reconstruct the distributed aggregation tree 
after completion of this data gathering. 
(3) Data after aggregation are faulty. This is mostly the 
results of adoption of improper aggrega
 dling mechanisms, making data after aggregation deviate 
from actual value. Here the prediction model for aggregated 
data is used to predict data, while failure is reported to the 
base station for examining aggregation algorithms and data 
handling mechanisms.

leads to the increase of node density, resulting in increasing of 
number of members in each node’s collaborative group. Both 
of above situations will result in increasing of the probability, 
that abnormal data are judged to be an event.

Figure 10. Co  and other two 
Figure 10 shows that the adaptive weighted average 
method can indeed effectively reduce weights of faulty nodes 
to improve data accuracy. However, since the weight 
adjustment is a cumulative process, it can not guarantee the 
validity of data at the prophase of adjustment process, and it is 
clearly inappropriate for Temporary Failure. In contrast, the 
algorithm in [7] uses the median measured values of the 
neighbor nodes of node-18 (node-9, node-22 and node-25) as 
the measured value of node-18, which can indeed eliminate 
mparison between our algorithm

the impact of faulty data to some extent. However, if node-9 
and node-25 both generate faulty data meanwhile, node-18 
will adopt faulty data of neighbor nodes as its own estimated 
value, as shown in figure 10. While our fault-tolerant 
algorithm, which uses historical data to predict data, can 
effectively improve above disadvantages, excluding the 
impact of faulty data and satisfying real-time requirement. As 
shown in figure 10, predicted values approach actual values, 
enhancing fault tolerance of network.
