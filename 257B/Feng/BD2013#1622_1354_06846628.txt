Abstract—Today world has witnessed the catastrophic 
consequences of natural and man-made disasters are demanding 
the urgent need for more research to advance fundamental 
knowledge and innovation for disaster prevention, mitigation 
and management. At the same time, the world is in the age of the 
Big Data revolution which holds the potential to mitigate the 
effects of disaster events by enabling access to critical real time 
information. Thus, in this paper an integrated framework for 
analyzing disaster events by using the Big Data analytics is 
proposed.  The proposed framework shall address three key 
components to perform data organization, data integration and 
analysis, information presentation to users by utilizing Big Data 
with respect to disaster events. In doing so, the paper shall create 
a disaster domain-specific search engine using co-occurring 
theory and Markov chain concepts for preparing impacts of 
disaster attacks to make the society better aware of the 
situations. Specifically, stochastic clustering with constraints is 
used to automatically extract disaster events by defining the set 
of structural attributes. Some illustrative simulations are shown 
by using Big Data sources for the Great East Japan earthquake, 
tsunami and nuclear disaster events of 2011.  
Keywords-Big Data analytics; disaster events; co-occurring 
theory; Markov chain appraoch 
I.  INTRODUCTION 
Natural or man-made disasters have caused a huge impact 
in the world`s economic and social systems which result in 
death or injury to humans, and damage or loss of properties 
such as building, communication systems, natural resources 
etc. Natural disasters come without warning taking lives of 
tens, hundreds and thousands of people. In such cases, the use 
of timely, accurate and effective disaster information in 
disaster management and preparation scenarios has been 
extensively discussed in literature [1-3]. Generally, the data 
resources include news/articles/blogs from web, social 
networks platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, Flickr and 
multimedia data like images and videos. The amount of data 
being gathered and stored is growing at a phenomenal rate in 
volume, velocity, and variety which can be referred to as Big 
Data. Since the combined characteristics of those data are 
based on (i) data producer and consumer concepts, (ii) time 
and space sensitivity of the exchanged information, (iii) the 
level of reliabilities of the information sources, (iv) 
unstructured, and (v) various formats, it is challenging as well 
as creating opportunities for extracting insight information 
about the disaster events through the Big Data analytics [4-6]. 
In this context, studying human and event behaviors become 
an important factor of Big Data environments. In addition, the 
timely prediction of weather patterns and likelihood of hazard 
occurrences are also key interests of Big Data analytics. Big 
Data can also provide more real-time feedback information 
than ever before. 
On the other hand, there are more traffic flows in 
communication high ways through social network platforms 
such as Twitter, Facebook and etc. during the time of disasters. 
These communications are mainly about information seeking, 
family and friends contacts in disaster zone. In such 
environments, Big Data can play a major role for seeking the 
insight information. Thus the aim of the paper is to explore 
the possibilities for the use of Big Data in the analyzing 
human behavior involved events in case of natural disasters 
and to propose an integrated framework for organizing 
insight information and data exchange between the 
participants in such events. The proposed method is based on 
the combination of Big Data concept and an emerging 
network science which is rooted in mathematics. Through 
the plotting of data on a network map, critical nodes known 
as hubs, can be identified for further study. Understanding a 
hub and its importance within a network provides 
information about the strength of the network, its 
interconnectedness, and the function of the network itself. In!
 addition, the identification of less significant nodes and their 
quantity provides information on the scope of the network 
and its structural stability. Observing the nature of hubs and 
nodes in a network allows for an overall understanding of its 
function is illustrated in Fig. 1. 
The remaining parts of the paper are section wise 
organized. First some related research works are described in 
section 2. Section presents the proposed integrated 
framework for analyzing disaster events by using Big Data 
analytics approach. Some simulation results are shown in 
section 3 to confirm the effectiveness of the proposed 
method. Conclusions are drawn in section 4. 
II. SOME RELATED RESEARCH WORKS 
In the existing literature, many research works 
concerning with simulation models for disaster response but 
only a few works in Big Data aspects. For example, 
according to [7], it has noticed that the tweets data about 
food price in Indonesia and the official statistics are very 
much related in similar patterns as seen in Fig. 2. This shows 
the important of Big Data analytics.

 Generally, disaster event analysis requires methodologies 
for aggregation of the disaster-related data. Toward such a 
demand, the concept of Disaster Management Data space is 
established based on data acquisition, organization, and 
representation [8]. Another effort to investigate disaster 
event behavior is ontology-based approach [9] and 
knowledge-based approach by using social network 
platforms [10]. On the other hand, a large number of decision 
support systems have been developed for various types of 
disasters based on different models and decision support 
needs. A web-based decision support system for the response 
to strong earth-quakes is developed [11]. The system was 
focused on damage assessment and identification of effective 
response measures. An agent-based system for knowledge 
management and planning is developed for suggesting plans 
in emergency and disaster scenarios. Similar decision 
support systems have also been developed for hurricane 
emergencies [12, 13], and rescue operations [14]. However 
most of existing disaster event analysis systems failed since 
the data in disaster management application domains are 
collected and stored in various media types (text, image, 
video, graphics, etc.), formats, and structures from multiple 
information sources in Big Data environments. Many of 
these data are streaming data and collected in real-time, 
which may have temporal and spatial characteristics. These 
data may have different levels of completeness and 
confidence, and may be inconsistent. There is also 
information shift problem in these applications. That is, the 
information/knowledge may be constantly changed, outdated, 
and incomplete. Moreover the data come from heterogeneous 
sources, having a mix of unstructured and structured types, 
of different temporal and spatial characteristics, with various 
sources of uncertainty. To our best knowledge, there are no 
existing methodologies and/or algorithms that can properly 
address the current issues of disaster related event 
satisfactorily. Developing novel techniques for managing and 
analyzing data that are a mix of unstructured and structured 
types, of different temporal and spatial characteristics, with 
various sources of uncertainty, is a challenging task. In order 
to address the current issues of disaster related events, an 
integrated approach is proposed in this paper. 
III. PROPOSED INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK 
To be able use the massive volume of unstructured Big 
Data for disaster event analysis the proposed framework 
shall bring some order of the Big Data as shown in Fig. 3. 
The framework is composed of three conceptual cubes 
namely; (i) structure-metric- time cube, (ii) domain-attribute-
 response cube, (iii) hub-node-analysis cube. 
In the framework, the first tube is made up of three 
functional dimensions in which the structure dimension is to 
extract information about entities such as persons, 
organizations, places, etc. and events natural disasters, 
meetings, crowd behaviors etc. so that the structure of events 
can be further analyzed. The time dimension is to detect 
what actual calendar time the information is referred to when 
an event is described. For example, “9:37 A.M, September 
11, 2001”, “3 P.M, March 11, 2011”. The function of metric 
dimension is for deciding the importance of received 
information. The metrics are numeric attributes of entities 
and events. For computational purpose, this cube will be 
represented by the random variable )(MSt  where S stands 
for structure at time t with reference to metric M. 
When the structure, time and events are known, the data 
will be further organized into the second tube of specific 
domain, attributes, and response (action). In the second tube, 
the domain dimension shall address the type of disaster such 
as man-made or natural. Whether it is large or small since the 
scale will influence on the modeling techniques. For example, 
a terrorist attack may require methods for modeling the 
impact of explosion and suspicious people or objects 
behaviors. However, a tsunami and earthquake will require 
capabilities to model stranded victims and estimating social 
outcomes. The second dimension is organizing the interest of 
attributes. This dimension aims to minimize the impact of 
disaster event in the domain dimension. This will include 
living creature mainly human population, the impact of 
disaster on the infrastructure resources.

Figure 3.  The overview of the proposed system. 
The dimension of the controlling agents and their actions 
on the disaster events is also an important dimension in the 
second tube. It is necessary to model to understand the 
situations and scenarios. They themselves can become the 
disaster affected attributes. Since these three dimensions are 
equally important for disaster event analysis in Big Data 
aspect, three different random variables are used for 
representation of the cube. In particular, it will be 
represented by tD  for domain, tA  for attribute of interest 
and tR for types of response actions to be taken at time t. 
The last tube of hub-node-analysis will perform the 
process of clustering the nodes or entities of interest defined 
in the previous two tubes. These clusters will be termed as 
hubs which will be focused for further analysis to obtain the 
insight situations of the disaster events. This can be 
described by a random variable ),,( ANHOt  representing 
the outcome result of analysis over corresponding hubs and 
nodes involved. 
Therefore, the proposed framework will lead to the study 
of 5-tuples )),,(,,,),(( ANHORADMS ttttt . For simplicity,

where, ikp  is one-step transition probability going from state 
i to state k.  
 Suppose that the initial state 0Z is random with

(4), and law of total probability, we obtain

By using these probabilities, we can obtain the trends and 
behaviors of the associated disaster events. 
Thus solving (3), recursively, one can obtain the 
information about the current situation for the disaster event. 
IV. SIMULATION RESULTS 
In this section, some simulations of the proposed method 
will be performed by using Japan earthquake and Tsunami 
events. An hour after the earth quake hit Japan on March 11, 
2011, the Big Data tracks 1200 tweets per minute. It also 
found that nine out of 10 tweets are trending topics -such as 
#pray for japan, #tsunami and #japan - were directly related 
to the earthquake and tsunami. The corresponding state 
variables are shown in Table I. 
)1(tS  causes )2(tS , meanwhile )2(tS  causes tD , and tD  
causes )3(),2(),1( ttt AAA . In order to investigate the trend 
patterns of the tsunami events, all possible combinations of 
5-tuples defined in section 3 are formed as follows. In this 
scenario, there are 12 possible combinations all together. 
They are described as follows. 
)),(),(,),((
 ,, tttttkji OkRjADiSE =  as shown in (1) for 
2,1=i , 3,2,1=j , 2,1=k  which makes 2x3x2 = 12 events. 
The corresponding transition probabilities are generated 
by using exponential random numbers and normalizing 
procedures. Then, resulting matrix P is given as shown in 
Table II. 
By using (5), the time dependent solution for each event 
is obtained and the trend graph is plotted as shown in Fig. 4. 
The graph shows the trends for a summary data from a group 
of subjects. The horizontal line represents the time points. 
The vertical line represents the likelihood patterns of 
matching of event and corresponding response such as 
recuse or behavior information. The event of “a family on 
the floating” and response type “recuse” are more matched 
than other combination. The same is true for the event of 
257
“crowd stranded and “behavior analyzed and recuse”. In 
particular, the top line shows the behavior of the combined 
event E2,3,2 which reads from table 1 as tsunami )2(tS ,  
standard crowd forming a queue )3(tA  and actions taken by 
rescue workers )2(tR . Similarly, the second top line shows the 
matching pattern for the event of combination of (tsunami, a 
family floating and rescue). But, the second bottom line shows 
the matching patterns of (earthquake, family floating and 
crowd behavior analysis) are not much directly related. The 
same is true for the last bottom line in the graph.  Since these 
findings are matched with what we expect in real world, more 
insight information to be extracted in our future work.

V. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, an integrated framework for disaster event 
analysis in the Big Data environments has been presented. 
The system had developed some useful insight information 
prediction scheme based on multidimensional Markov chain 
modeling and time dependent data models. This approach is 
tightly integrated into highly Big Data analytics system 
including social network platforms. In future works, context-
 based Big Data analysis will be addressed to improve the 
current disaster event analysis methods for faster and reliable 
insight information.
