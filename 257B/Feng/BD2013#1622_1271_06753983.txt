 Abstract
 According to the wide development of the World Wide
 Web world, many peoples have tend to mention “big data”
 and tried to make use of the “big data.” They usually
 mention “big data” as a key to the happy future. However,
 it will be a dream which will not be realized. In this paper,
 I review problems in big data. Then I propose a concept
 of curation to deal with such big and complex data.
 I. Introduction
 According to the wide development of the World Wide
 Web world, many peoples have tend to mention “big data”
 and tried to make use of the “big data.” They usually
 mention “big data” as a key to the happy future. Thus
 in Japan, usually magazines or books show very positive
 aspects of big data. Of course some magazines such as
 Weekly Toyo Keizai (2013.4.20) also pointed out the
 negative aspect of big data. That is, big data usually contain
 harmful data (noise). In addition, if data become too big,
 it becomes rather difficult to comprehend whole data. If
 we simply analyze the data, we will only be able to obtain
 poor results which are useless or harmful.
 In [23] Silver shows both aspects of big data and
 illustrates actual results from both aspects. Especially he
 claims the importance of distinguishing a true signal from
 a universe of noisy, ever-increasing data. For instance, for
 the forecasting the electoral politics, he points out “Fox-
 like attitudes may be especially important when it comes
 to making predictions about politics.” Fox’s strategy is to
 believe in a plethora of little ideas and in taking a multitude
 of approaches toward a problem. They tend to be more
 tolerant of nuance, uncertainty, complexity, and dissenting
 opinion. On the other hand, hedgehogs who have a lot
 of information construct stories — stories that are neater
 and tidier than the real world. When we construct these
 stories, we can lose the ability to think about the evidence
 critically. From the viewpoint of Silver, for the larger
 information, it is necessary to divide it to small pieces and
 consider nuance, uncertainty, complexity, and dissenting
 situation of the information.
 For big data, Fung [13] pointed out “numbersense
 begins with looking at the data. Keep your hands off,
 though, until you have dug out excruciating details of how
 the data is collected. [...] raw, untampered-with data almost
 never yields the answer. Some form of adjustments —
 whether it’s seasonality, or bias correction, or others —are
 like the dressing on top of a salad.” The most important
 point is that to understand how the data is collected. That
 is, if we do not consider the origin or source of data, we
 sometimes analyze the data wrongly. Thus a strategy to
 review the feature of data is very important.
 In fact, the similar problems were discussed before
 the “big data” age. In this paper, I introduce a concept
 of curation to deal with “big data.” First, I illustrate the
 medical data as complex data. Then I show the importance
 of interface between users and data. For that curation is
 adopted to achieve the better interface system. In addition,
 I illustrate how curation functions in the context of the
 data market proposed by Ohsawa [19].
 II. From small data to big data
 A. Data collection
 We proposed a framework called Cyber Integrated
 Medical Infrastructure (CIMI) which is a framework of
 integrated management of clinical data on computer net-
 works consisting of a database, a knowledge base, and an
 inference and learning component, which are connected to
 each other in the network [2]. In this framework, medical
 information (e.g. clinical data) is analyzed or data mined
 to build a knowledge base for predicting all possible
 diseases and to support medical diagnosis. As shown
 below, more than 130 items are included in the medical
 data of each person. Item sets in the data are, for instance,

2-microglobulin (serum), SCC antigen, -seminoprotein,

 1-globulin, ALP Triglyceride, LDL Cholesterol, HDL
 Cholesterol, urine sugar, HbA1c, White blood cell count,
 Platelet, Cl, Cell immunity T Cell number, and ACP.
 Usually such type of data are collected during medial
 treatments. However, such collected data usually lack sev-
 eral items. Because physicians tend to omit unnecessary or
 expensive data. For instance, if they do not think a patient
 has any problem in lung, they do not ask to collect data
 regarding lung. Accordingly, the collected data do not in-
 clude such data. In Abe04a, we tried to supplement lacking
 data by adding newly and computationally generated data.
 However, such data will not be the same as actual data. For
 the treatment we assumed that the data distribution would
 follow the standard distribution. Accordingly the generated
 data will follow our estimated pattern. In addition, it will
 be difficult to collect large size of data only during medical
 treatment. Therefore, we decided to collected the complete
 clinical data as an experiment. In the project, we have
 intently collected more than 2200 medical data sets. From
 certain persons, the data were collected more than once.
 Actually we could collect complete clinical data, but
 the distribution of age is shown in Fig. 1. The ratio of
 persons in their 50’s is very high which might become
 the reason for the different distribution of health levels1.
 Currently, we collect data from office workers (aged 40 to
 50 years old) but not from students or younger persons.
 Thus the age distribution pattern is not similar to the
 Japanese standard age distribution pattern. This is because
 we did not collect samples from persons belonging to
 all types of person but only from those who applied to
 take part in our experiments. Most of our subjects are old
 office workers in rather high position and live in or close
 to Tokyo. Therefore, our results might not reflect social
 tendencies.

 Actually we can collect large size of clinical data by

 the experiment. In addition to the above problem we still
 have more serious problem.
 B. Data treatment
 We have generated the health level determination model
 by applying C4.5 [20] to the collected data. For the
 accuracy ratio of the health level determination, with the
 model generated by around 2000 samples, 44.3 % of health
 level can be correctly determined. In fact, for health level
 3, it is rather difficult to correctly determine the health
 level. Since the data distribution is not balanced as well
 as does not follow standard data distribution, we do not
 have sufficient number of example in health level 3 to
 build a proper model. Even if we can collect a large
 sized data set, if it is heterogeneous, it is still difficult to
 conduct a proper data analysis. In addition, the structure
 of the data is complex, it is rather difficult to conduct a
 proper data analysis. In fact, our data set includes many
 items (more than 130). Accordingly it is rather difficult
 to deal with the data 2. Because in the data set, data from
 various type of client are included. For instance, those who
 have Diabetes Mellitus and those who have Helicobacter
 pylori are included. For each case, the feature of medical
 data should be different. Accordingly, in order to explain
 various situations, the generated decision tree becomes
 very complex, that is, it has many leaves.
 During medical treatment physicians usually focus on
 necessary data for their diagnosis. However, computers
 cannot perform such a selective analysis. They can deal
 with all data equally. Accordingly analyzed data sometimes
 represent the different aspect of the data. Therefore, it will
 be necessary to provide a strategy to achieve a selective
 analysis or help such analysis.
 In addition, it is necessary to discover relationships
 of data, which can suggest the removal of unnecessary
 links and can aid the recovery or supplement of missing
 rules or links that lead to the determination of the correct
 health levels. Several relationships that could improve the
 accuracy in determining health levels could be discovered.
 C. Data visualization
 For the better analysis of data, intuitively introduction
 of data visualization can be considered. In [5] and [8],
 I introduced a system called an Interface for medical
 diagnosis support.
 During the procedure shown in Fig. 2, the user can
 review a certain patient whose health status is estimated
 as 5a3. In the right window of the right browser, the user
 2It is sometimes called as the curse of dimensionality.
 3In [5], I described health status as health level. For the definition of
 health level, please refer to [5] etc.
 665

 nosis support.
 can check the selected data to confirm if the patient is in
 the health status of 5a. Similarly, the user can view all
 the estimated health status at a glance and check doubtful
 or uncertain patient’s data. Thus the proposed system
 offers a flexible interface to conduct medical diagnosis
 and data compilation. Beside, the most important point of
 the proposed system is that all windows (interfaces) are
 automatically generated according to the data set and the
 analyzed results.
 By using the interactive interface, the user can discover
 hidden or potential and important factor of patient. From
 this viewpoint, we can say this application is chance
 discovery application. In addition, we can say it can offer
 curatorial situation. Detailed discussions will appear in the
 following sections.
 III. Curation
 This section reviews various types of curation. Actually
 curatorial task is usually used for tasks in (art) museum.
 Many cases introduced in this section are curatorial works
 in gallery and (art) museum. In addition a new type of
 curation, -digital data curation, is also reviewed.
 A. (General) curation
 There is at least a person who is responsible as “cu-
 rator” in (special) exhibitions, galleries, archive, or (art)
 museums. Their main task of curator is a curatorial task,
 which is multifaceted. Curator comes from a Latin word
 “cura” which means cure. Then originally it used for a
 person who take care of a cultural heritage.
 In the report by American Association of Museums
 Curators Committee (AAMCC) [12], they pointed out
 “curators are highly knowledgeable, experienced, or ed-
 ucated in a discipline relevant to the museum’s purpose or
 mission. Curatorial roles and responsibilities vary widely
 within the museum community and within the museum
 itself, and may also be fulfilled by staff members with
 other titles.” Then they showed the definition of curator as
 follows;
  Remain current in the scholarly developments
 within their field(s); conduct original research and
 develop new scholarship that contributes to the
 advancement of the body of knowledge within
 their field(s) and within the museum profession
 as a whole.
  Make recommendations for acquiring and deac-
 cessioning objects in the museum collection.
  Assume responsibility for the overall care and
 development of the collection, which may include
 artifacts, fine art, specimens, historic structures,
 and intellectual property.
  Advocate for and participate in the formulation of
 institutional policies and procedures for the care
 of the collection that are based on accepted profes-
 sional standards and best practices as defined by
 AAM, CurCom, and other relevant professional
 organizations.
  Perform research to identify materials in the col-
 lection and to document their history.
  Interpret the objects belonging or loaned to the
 museum.
  Develop and organize exhibitions.
  Contribute to programs and educational materials.
  Advocate and provide for public use of the col-
 lection.
  Develop or contribute to monographs, essays,
 research papers, and other products of original
 thought.
  Represent their institution in the media, at public
 gatherings, and at professional conferences and
 seminars.
  Remain current on all state, national, and inter-
 national laws as they pertain to objects in the
 museum collection.
 In addition, AAMCC showed curatorial responsibilities
 as follows;
 A. Research, Scholarship, and Integrity
 B. Interpretation
 C. Acquisition, Care, and Disposal
 D. Collection Access and Use
 E. Replication of Objects in the Collection
 Thus curators have responsibilities for various aspects
 of exhibition activities. However, the most important ac-
 tivity will be a plan of exhibition. For that the above
 activities such as research, interpretation and acquisition
 are necessary. They should properly exhibit a truth which
 is result of their researches and interpretations.
 666
B. e-Science Data Curation
 The above curation is for actual museums. That is,
 curation is conducted mainly for actual works. However,
 curation in this section is for digital data. There are several
 differences between digital curation and analogue curation.
 JISC pointed out an importance of curation as “pro-
 moting good curation and an information infrastructure
 to capitalise upon and preserve expensively gathered data
 means bringing together varied technical and managerial
 resources, and managing these over time. This activity
 needs to be supported by clear strategies for resourcing
 and support [14].”
 They compare curation with archiving and preservation.
  Curation: The activity of managing and promoting
 the use of data from its point of creation, to ensure
 it is fit for contemporary purpose, and available for
 discovery and re-use. For dynamic datasets this
 may mean continuous enrichment or updating to
 keep it fit for purpose.
  Archiving: A curation activity which ensures that
 data is properly selected, stored, can be accessed
 and that its logical and physical integrity is main-
 tained over time, including security and authentic-
 ity.
  Preservation: An archiving activity in which spe-
 cific items of data are maintained over time so
 that they can still be accessed and understood
 through successive change and obsolescence of
 technologies.
 That is, they pointed out that curation is more creative
 task. Then they showed aspects of curation as follows:
  Trust: Trust can be enhanced by the existence of
 qualified domain specialists who curate the data.
  Utility: Certain information about the data —
 where it came from, how it was generated, for
 example— is necessary to enable future users to
 gauge the utility and reliability of the data, and
 indeed any annotation of the data. Data utility
 also depends on the ability of users to manage
 and analyse it; data mining tools and algorithms,
 visualisation tools, user interfaces and portals will
 play a crucial role in accelerating research.
  Discoverability: How will future users find data,
 in particular data they do not know exists, in other
 domains, or archived according to terminology
 which has fallen out of use? Data access is often
 organised through portals; how will those portals
 be organised? What tools will users need to read
 or use the data, and who will provide these tools?
  Access management: A significant proportion of
 data involves confidentiality issues. Ownership
 and rights management also need to be taken into
 account.
  Heterogeneity: Not only is this data revolution
 creating a deluge of data, the data itself comes in
 very many different and often specialist formats,
 some created by the researchers themselves.
  Complexity: The data can be composite in nature,
 with links to external objects and external depen-
 dencies (such as calibration information), and be
 highly complex in structure. This complexity rep-
 resents a significant challenge for the preservation
 of data.
 They use “data curation” because they think data have
 value. Not only for keeping data but also usability of data
 for the public, they use the word “curation.” Actually,
 most of data are neither art works nor archaeological
 artifacts. However, is is important to view data from the
 aspect of what should be preserved. The main difference
 between data and art works or archaeological artifacts is
 that data do not have a shape and cannot exist alone.
 It is necessary to prepare a container such as a cdrom
 and a hard disc drive system. Therefore for data curation,
 “Discoverability” plays a significant role.
 The aim of the data curation seems to have the similar
 objective as data jacket [18].
 C. Curation in business and information market
 In 2011, several books on curation were published. In
 Japan we had at least two publications which I noticed
 by Katsumi [15] and Sasaki [22]. In addition, Rosenbaum
 published “Curation Nation” [21] in the same year. They
 discuss a “curation” in “business” and information market
 field.
 As an example, I review “curation” by Sasaki.
 Sasaki defined curation in [22] as follows:
 Curation: From huge amount of information source, ac-
 cording to the curator’s sense of value and world view,
 picking up information, giving a new meaning to it and
 sharing it with many persons.
 Sasaki used a metaphor of biotope4 to illustrate the
 promotion of a unknown or less known but a good artist.
 His main point to successful promotion is to recognize:
  Where those who need a certain information live?
  How to offer the information to those who need
 the information?
  How to make them impressed by the information?
 4Biotope is an area of uniform environmental conditions providing a
 living place for a specific assemblage of plants and animals. Biotope
 is almost synonymous with the term habitat, but while the subject of a
 habitat is a species or a population, the subject of a biotope is a biological
 community. (from Wikipedia)
 667
He gave a metaphor the place where those who need
 a certain information live as a biotope. Actually strategies
 he illustrated are very intentional because they are business
 that should be successful and that were succeeded. In addi-
 tion, he pointed out the importance of a human as a media.
 That is in order to generate sympathies, there should be a
 certain context and the context will be generated (aware)
 not only by a viewpoint such as search keyword, place and
 program but also by the specialized person’s sense of value
 and world view. His viewpoint is based on Social Network
 System (SNS), then his curation can be regarded as a
 generation of explicit, multi-core circle type, and indefinite
 relationship supported by social media.
 Curation in business?: A “curation” for business in the
 internet age seems an interaction between customer (user)
 and goods. There will not be a system to insist on
 trends from big companies, but trends will be constructed
 or selected according to customers’ interaction on (in-
 ter)networks. In addition, a (small) company or community
 can use this system to give rare goods a certain trend.
 Thus the strategy of information delivery in business
 has changed in recent year and they call this type of
 information delivery as “curation.” Curation in business
 means not only an information display system but also an
 information delivery strategy. If we interpret this type of
 curation as interaction between users and data, this type
 of curation should be considered during dealing with big
 data.
 IV. Complex data and curation
 A. Curation in chance discovery
 In [7], I proposed and defined a concept of curation in
 chance discovery5.
 Though in various articles, the definition of a “chance”
 is described which was introduced by Ohsawa [17], I wish
 to introduce it here again. In fact, it rather differs from
 the original definition in [17] to reflect the recent research
 interests.
 A chance is rare, hidden, potential or novel
 event(s) / situation(s) that can be conceived either
 as a future opportunity or risk.
 Then “chance discovery” research is a type of research
 to establish methods, strategies, theories, and even activi-
 ties to discover a chance. In addition, it aims at discovering
 human factors for chance discoveries.
 Accordingly a definition of curation in chance discovery
 is:
 5In [9] and [10], I extended the definition of curation in chance
 discovery, which introduced a concept of holistic communication [11].
 In this paper, I used the extended version of curation.
  Curation is a task to offer users opportunities to
 discover chances.
  Curation should be conducted with considering to
 offer implicit and potential possibilities.
  Chances should not be explicitly displayed to
 users.
  However, such chances should rather easily be
 discovered and arranged according to the user’s
 interests and situations. This can be achieved for
 instance by affordance.
  There can be a certain holistic communication
 environment. This type of holistic communication
 might function as media to discover chance for
 novice users.
  There should be a certain freedom for user to in-
 terpret a key person, matter, thing or event, which
 should only stimulate or assist users’ thinking
 procedure.
  There should be a certain freedom for user to
 arrange chances.
 The main point of curation is how to display data
 to users and how not to insist on any interpretation to
 users. But critical point to understand the data should be
 presented. Accordingly, users can rather easily deal with
 data and can interpret data flexibly, freely and properly.
 B. Application as curation
 In the previous section, I illustrated the interactive
 interface for medical treatment. Actually it was developed
 for the purpose of a diagnosis support for physicians.
 In addition it was developed by the concept of chance
 discovery. That is, it designed to provide an opportunity
 to discover hidden or potential and important factor of
 patient. Therefore, it provide both the original data and
 the analyzed result. The original data and the analyzed
 result are linked via HTML-based browsers. The interface
 is automatically generated from clinical data. At first, as a
 result of C4.5 analysis, Fig. 3 is generated. This browser
 provides very simple information. If we click the ID shown
 in the lest window, the analyzed decision tree is shown in
 the right window.
 If we click link anchors on leaves of the decision
 tree, another (second) browser will be coming up that
 has more detailed information on health level (Fig. 4). In
 this browser, we can check the standard range of each
 items relating to the health level. For instance, the range
 of TK Activity should be less than 5.0. The standard value
 is obtained by referring to the data library of Mitsubishi
 Chemical Medience Corporation (http://www.medience.co.
 jp/). Only items included in the clicked line are shown.
 668
Fig. 3. Interactive interface for medical diag-
 nosis support (1st).
 Fig. 4. Interactive interface of medical data
 analysis: Subjects list on a leaf of the decision
 tree is shown.
 By clicking at the ID in the second browser, the third
 browser is obtained as shown in Fig.5, which presents the
 medical data for that ID. In the browser, the abnormally
 high values can be found as described in red and abnor-
 mally low values as described in blue. For instance, in
 this case, Apolipoprotein A-I is 192.0, Apolipoprotein B is
 107.0, and blood sugar is 120. That means that he/she may
 suffer from rather serious Lipid metabolism abnormalities
 or Arteriosclerosis. In fact, with the proposed interface, it
 is rather easy to focus on such abnormal data.
 Thus we can review results by C4.5 in the organic view
 and we can check each value relating to certain health
 levels in detail.
 Of course, an intelligent data base can perform such
 compilation of data. However, one of the important feature
 Fig. 5. Part of a third browser.
 is the interface links data and analyzed data. In the case,
 the analysis is performed by C4.5.
 In [8], I pointed out as follows:
  Even if health levels are differently recorded,
 when the subjects health levels are properly de-
 termined, it is easy to correct them. The reason
 for this is that differently recorded health levels
 are displayed in red colour and therefore the link
 can be followed to check the original data and to
 confirm if their health levels are correct or not.
  Exceptional (abnormal or normal) factors and the
 missing rules can be discovered with an interactive
 interface. For instance, necessary rules which are
 not considered during health level determination
 can be discovered by focusing on values that are
 abnormal for their health levels. As shown above,
 it is easy to detect abnormal values by their colour.
 For the same reason, it is not difficult to discover
 exceptions, because exceptions usually contain
 abnormal data for their health levels.
  Without the proposed interface, it is rather difficult
 to focus on necessary and meaningful data sets,
 because more than 100 items are contained in each
 individual data set and more than 2500 data have
 been collected. By using the interface, it is easy
 to determine which data should be checked.
 Thus this type of interface can be considered as cura-
 tion. Because the interface only displays user-friendly view
 of a computationally analyzed result and allows flexible
 interpretations. In addition, as suggested above, it can also
 be functioned as an intelligent data base. Perhaps this is
 also a sort of data curation.
 Accordingly one of problems in big data analysis —
 how to distinguish noise from data— can be solved by
 this type of curation.
 C. Curation and Data Jacket
 In [19], Ohsawa pointed out to characterize a data jacket
 as follows:
 In these stores6, we often find a poster saying
 “this shelf has only the jacket; for the content
 6shopping stores of movie DVDs and music CDs
 669
please go ahead to buy at the register.” This trend
 implies that information more abstract (of less
 details) than a certain level can be shown open
 to the public, whereas the rest in details tends
 to be hidden. This idea is quite useful when we
 consider to create a social environment where
 data are accessible from those who seek, and
 where each dataset or database can be valued, or
 priced commercially, reasonably. [...] In contrast
 to what are called big data in the business
 context, which are hard for small firms to collect
 or manage, the entry of a single participant into
 his/her Facebook wall may be evaluated as of
 a priceless value if the feature of the content
 is sufficiently appealed via the statement on the
 jacket about the wall.
 A data jacket functions as an index or an introduction
 of (big) data. It will not describe all information of the
 data. Thus users should guess the importance of the data
 by reviewing the description of the data jacket. For the
 better description of data jacket, it will better to introduce
 the concept of curation, especially chance discovery-based
 curation. For instance, an example shown in the above
 will suggest the formalization of a description format of
 data jacket. That is, during generating a data jacket, the
 data can be compiled to show their structure. In addition,
 each data can be linked to the structure. Then the user
 can understand the importance and the feature of the data.
 In addition, the user can distinguish noise from data. Of
 course, the concept of data generator or collector should
 not represented in the description. The interface should
 allow the user’s free thinking and selection of the data. In
 the sense, data jacket will have a certain interactive feature
 where the user can check the data from various aspects. In
 the above, I adopt C4.5 for the data analysis. The interface
 is general, so any analysis (data mining) tool can be applied
 to data analysis. The style of the interface can be designed
 according to the data type and the application. I used the
 HTML-based interface. I think it will be better to use a
 portable interface. Because the user can use in various
 situations and OSs.
 Thus the procedure of data analysis can become (the
 circulation of) the followings:
 data collection
 (data cleaning)
 data analysis
 interface (data jacket) generation
 data interpretation
 (data cleaning)
 Then it will be possible to deal with data very flexibly
 and use the data in an organic way. We can deal with the
 data according to the proper perspective and even we can
 change our perspective to the data.
 V. Conclusions
 In this paper, I reviewed curation based on chance
 discovery and showed an interactive interface for medical
 diagnosis as an application of the curation. Then I intro-
 duced the concept of curation to the data jacket generation.
 Perhaps part of problems in dealing with big data will
 be:
  How to implicitly lead user to the point which
 should be considered?
  How to distinguish noise from data?
  How not to insist on a fixed interpretation to the
 users?
 Actually these problems are not specialized to the big
 data mining. They are pointed out before the big data age,
 especially in the school of chance discovery. In fact, I
 pointed out these problems and proposed the concept of
 curation based on chance discovery. In this paper, I discuss
 the curation under the context of the big data mining. Data
 jacket is an important scheme for the description of data.
 Users can guess or consider the usage of the data via
 the description of data jacket. However, the description
 should not insist users on a fixed interpretation of data and
 their usage. User can freely interpret and use the data, and
 combine several data to make them better. In addition, user
 can distinguish noise from data. The bigger data become,
 the more data contain noise.
 In this paper I showed that, by the introduction of
 automatic generation of interactive interface from data, it is
 possible to provide a curated situation and it can be used as
 an interactive data jacket during checking and utilizing the
 data. The format of data jacket may not be the same as that
 proposed by Ohsawa. But an interactive data jacket will be
 one of the solution to deal with big data. By the interactive
 data jacket a curatorial situation can be offered to the user,
 then he/she can use the data in the best way. Since the
 curation is based on chance discovery, the performance
 can become the style of chance discovery where the user
 can be aware of chances and make use of them.
 In this paper, I did not discuss the knowledge level of
 users. A strategy of data treatment will depend upon user’s
 knowledge level. It will be necessary to change the curation
 type according to user’s knowledge level. In the definition
 of curation I mentioned
  There can be a certain holistic communication
 environment. This type of holistic communication
 might function as media to discover chance for
 novice users.
 Thus a holistic communication can be changed accord-
 ing to the user’s knowledge level.
