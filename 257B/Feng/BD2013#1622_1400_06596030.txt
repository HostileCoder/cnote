 Abstract—We propose a novel anonymous access control pro-
 tocol which is formulated as a series of coalitional games, where
 the players are the owners of shared private resources (big
 volumes of data) in online social networks (OSNs). Basically, co-
 owners cooperate to generate by themselves an attribute-based
 boolean formula to control access to their shared resource.
 By means of this boolean formula, co-owners are able to
 secretly express their privacy preferences over a common
 shared resource and requesters can anonymously access the
 secured private resource. In this paper, we formally analyze
 our protocol’s fairness from a cooperative game theory point
 of view, and how OSN users, which are mostly cooperative,
 evaluate their expected gains and costs to adopt such cooper-
 ative privacy management scheme in many different settings.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 Online social networks (OSNs) provide users with a form
 of self-expression and with a highly accessible channel for
 their interactions. Recently, the formation and structure of
 online social communities where users engage with each
 other in the sharing of (mostly private) data have attracted
 considerable research interest. Studies are specially exten-
 sive in analyzing the evolution of such communities and the
 factors influencing their rapid growth: their structural fea-
 tures (i.e., shared content, near locations, trusted friendship
 connections, etc.), the sociological aspects such as political
 and/or religious movements or professional factors, to name
 a few [1][2].
 Cooperation and collectiveness are fundamental concepts
 for the success of OSNs, however, most proposals in this
 domain lack of a relevant analysis of the collaborative (but
 rational) nature of OSN users [3]. Moreover, there exist
 operations that are still addressed as local and individual pro-
 cesses. For instance, current OSN sites provide insufficient
 and inaccurate controls to restrict data sharing, hindering
 users from applying appropriate fine-grained access policies
 over who may view their shared data [4][5]. And more
 importantly, users have limited control over the privacy
 settings applied by other users to the shared private data
 [6]. As a consequence, the privacy preferences of users who
 share contents may be conflicting.
 In this work, we focus on the cooperative game under-
 lying the cooperation-based management of user privacy
 preferences in OSNs. In this regard, a simple analytical
 model based on Cooperative Game Theory provides us with
 a metric to evaluate the feasibility of the formation of
 coalitions in OSNs, i.e., groups of allied users (the owners)
 joining forces together to protect a shared private content.
 We introduce an anonymous access control protocol which
 the game theoretical framework is built upon. Basically,
 throughout our protocol, co-owners of a common private
 resource (for instance, a collection of documents, a photo
 album, or a collection of movies) will be able to define in
 a joint and distributed manner the policies to control the
 anonymous access to the common resource. Motivational
 examples range from a large number of attendants to a
 conference who wish to share testimonial photos or articles
 of the event to a small group of friends sharing summer
 pictures.
 A. Related Work
 Cooperation-based approaches to privacy protection in
 OSNs have been slightly tackled [6][3]. Traditionally, pri-
 vacy in OSNs has been addressed as a matter of locally
 and manually introducing personal privacy preferences, most
 in the way of expressions built over generic predicates
 referring either to user set of attributes or to a set of content
 categories [6][7]. In this scenario, users can individually
 dictate access control policies which can be implemented
 by using different languages, like XML-based languages.
 Although non-cooperative, several access control schemes
 have been recently proposed in OSNs based on public key
 cryptography. For example, resources’ access control lists
 (ACLs), which contain the owner’s public key, the public
 keys of the members who can access the resource, and the
 social relationship amongst the members, have been applied
 to define different levels of access to the resource [5][8].
 A decentralized and collaborative rule-based access con-
 trol for OSNs is proposed in [3]. In this case, access
2
 conditions are a function of the relationship type, depth and
 trust level between providers and requesters. Owners issue
 and sign statements on these properties using relationship
 certificates based on what authors called “onion signatures”.
 Moreover, the application of game theory to analyze the
 rational behavior of the participants in OSNs has been
 sparse. To the best of our knowledge, only a few works
 have modeled so far the formation of coalitions in OSNs in
 an appropriately defined cooperative game. In particular, an
 interesting work to address co-ownership in OSNs is pro-
 posed in [6], where Clarke-Tax voting protocol was adopted
 to enable the collective enforcement of access policies for
 shared contents. Individual preferences are aggregated in the
 group policy using a voting procedure which maximizes
 the global social utility and promotes fairness encouraging
 truthfulness among the co-owners.
 Finally, the work presented in [9] deals with the analysis
 of the structure of the relationships that exist among the
 nodes in a social network towards determining how the
 information spreads in the network. Algorithms proposed are
 based on the Shapley values of the nodes to compute their
 influence in the network. Another approach which explores
 the cooperation of nodes in OSNs is described in [10] to
 study the structural and communication patterns aimed at
 predicting the links that are likely to appear in the future.
 B. Our Contribution
 This article offers the following main findings, contribut-
 ing to any previous related work as follows. On the one
 hand, our access control protocol completely differs from
 the aforementioned approaches in OSNs since it is based
 on a fully decentralized anonymous credential system. In
 particular, the anonymous credential system presented in
 Persiano et al.’s work [11] is combined and adjusted to recent
 advances in (dealer-less) secret sharing [12] mechanisms
 and threshold RSA signatures [13]. Briefly, owners of a
 shared private resource can secretly express their privacy
 preferences over that resource and control external access
 by means of an attribute-based boolean formula, which is
 defined involving every owner. Additionally, owners must
 collaborate in granting access to the resource requesters.
 Finally, the protocol preserves anonymity and unlinkability
 of requesters accessing a common shared resource who
 must prove, in a zero-knowledge fashion, that their attributes
 satisfy the boolean formula which protects the resource.
 On the other hand, the formal analysis of the proposed
 protocol requires the study of the coalition formation com-
 prising all co-owners. We formally give foundations of
 how the proposed cooperative protocol might induce the
 formation of an stable group of participants. To the best
 of our knowledge, no work has focused yet on cooperation–
 based privacy–aware access control for OSNs from a coali-
 tional game point of view, which includes considerations
 for the fairness of such cooperative coalitions. Furthermore,
 all social networking systems impose, on every participant,
 certain constrains in terms of engagement with time and/or
 computational capabilities. Novel to the related work is
 also the capacity of our formal analysis to capture and
 interpret the differences in the hardware used by entities
 when connecting to the social network (smartphones, low
 capabilities; PCs, high capabilities) and the different types
 of users (beginners, buddies, socializers, etc.)
 Organization: The rest of this article is organized as
 follows. In Section II, the main phases of our protocol
 are described in detail. Additionally, Section III introduces
 a formal analysis of the proposed protocol by applying
 coalitional games. Section IV describes the results of the
 fairness of our protocol in different scenarios. Finally, in
 Section V, some final conclusions and research directions
 are established.
 II. COOPERATION-BASED ANONYMOUS ACCESS
 CONTROL PROTOCOL
 In this section, we introduce a cooperation-based anony-
 mous access control protocol for OSNs, which is based on
 the Persiano et al.’s anonymous credential system [11]. In
 Persiano et al.’s work, a user obtains a multi-show credential
 from a central organization and uses it, in a zero-knowledge
 fashion, to gain access to the resources which are restricted
 to authorized users. Our proposal eliminates the organization
 role and allows a group of co-owners to issue RSA-signed
 access credentials to requesters in a fully decentralized way.
 We start describing the roles performed by the actors of our
 protocol and its phases.
 A. Roles
 The protocol defines four different roles:
 • Founder: a user who participates in the system set-up to
 jointly generate all the necessary parameters to execute
 the protocol.
 • Owner (or co-owner): a Founder user who joins a
 coalition of co-owners to generate the access control
 policy of a shared private resource ?.
 • Signer: an Owner that cooperates with other co-owners
 of the same resource ?, on the construction of user
 anonymous credentials to access ?.
 • Requester: a user who, having been issued an anony-
 mous credential by a group of signers, makes use of it
 to anonymously access ?.
 B. Phases
 Our protocol consists of four phases as follows:
 1) System Set-Up:
 A community of n founders comes together to gener-
 ate all the global parameters required by Persiano et
 al.’s system [11] which consist of publicly verifiable1
 1Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing plays an important role in the design
 of protocols for secure multi-party computation as everybody is able to
 verify that the shares have been correctly distributed.
3
 parameters and the corresponding private information
 that is used to issue credentials to requesters. Thus,
 we distribute the process of generating such global
 parameters between the n founders by applying the
 algorithm Joint Random Secret Sharing2 (JRSS) de-
 tailed in [12, Section 6.3]. Basically, the n founders are
 able to generate, in a joint and decentralized manner,
 all the RSA elements described in [11, Section 4.2]-
 System Set-up. As a result of this phase, each founder i
 holds a tuple Pubi containing all the public parameters
 and a tuple Privi containing all private parameters for
 each founder. In particular, Privi contains shares of
 all private values, allowing a group of at least (t+1)
 owners (with t < n) to jointly use their shares and
 generate valid signatures in the Credential Assignment
 phase. Parameter t is the threshold security parameter3
 of our protocol which applies the RSA (t, n)-threshold
 signature scheme4 proposed in [13].
 2) Policy Establishment:
 In this phase, the co-owners of a shared resource
 ? form a coalition to jointly generate the access
 control policy for ?. For instance, from a propositional
 logic point of view, an access control policy can
 be represented by a linear boolean formula over the
 specific predicates and/or variables (or a conjunction
 of them) and their relations, for a certain resource.
 The semantics attached to defining predicates should
 be adapted to each specific case such as age, gender,
 nationality and affiliation to name a few. In a general
 setting, the owners of a given resource ? may define
 an access policy ?? as a linear equation in a series of
 predicates (x1, . . . , xl).
 For simplicity reasons, we assume users to hold two
 attributes (x1, x2). Also, for simplicity purposes, in
 our work, ?’s co-owners secretly and jointly generate
 two integer values ? and ? as a way to express their
 privacy preferences over resource ? (? and ? are
 generated by executing the JRSS [12, Section 6.3]. The
 reasons behind the generation of these parameters in a
 joint and secret manner are mainly two: (1) Resource
 owners can secretly impose privacy preferences on the
 access to their private common resources (co-owners
 will learn nothing about each others’ preferences) and,
 (2) the resulting parameters are the combination of the
 2The implications of deploying threshold-based secret sharing in a
 distributed online social network have been recently tackled in [14]. In
 particular, the JRSS algorithm allows n parties to jointly generate a random
 integer secret value r with no information about r revealed to any party or
 coalition of at most t parties.
 3The security parameter is chosen amongst the group of co-owners of a
 particular private resource. However, experiments in Section IV show how
 the value t influences the system and the expected gain of each participant.
 4A number of (t + 1) nodes, each holding a valid private key share,
 can generate partial signatures which can be efficiently assembled into a
 complete signature.

 in Section III.
 preferences of all owners. Furthermore, we represent
 access policies as straight lines in two variables such
 that ??(x1, x2) = 1 ? ?x1 + ? = x2. Finally, ?? is
 made public.
 3) Credential Assignment:
 The procedure used to provide a user U with a
 valid5 anonymous access credential AACU , to gain
 authorization on ?, works as follows. U asks a co-
 owner R, known as the sponsor, for the access to ?,
 so it is assumed that U and R have already built social
 connections, i.e. U belongs to R’s trust circle.
 Thus, R involves at least t more co-owners in sign-
 ing the AACU . The following steps take place (see
 Figure 1): (1) R verifies if U ’s attributes (x1, x2) are
 valid according to the predicates established in ??.
 If verification succeeds, R creates a friend-request-
 message, namely M = (U,m, “is friend??), where
 m represents the cryptographic material required in
 [11, Section 4.2]-User enrollment to generate a valid
 user credential. M is sent to every other co-owner of ?.
 In step (2), each co-owner i (also called signer) signs6
 the received message m using his share of the RSA
 private key encoded in Privi and issues his partial
 signature ?i(m) to R. Next, in (3) R collects t partial
 signatures, performs its own partial signature on m
 and generates a valid AACU . Finally, in the step (4),
 R secretly sends AACU to U . From this moment
 onwards, U can access ?, via any participant providing
 ?, in an anonymous manner and as often as required
 without being identified, linked or traced.
 5AACU is valid if it encodes a tuple of attributes (x1, x2) that satisfy the
 control policy ?? , i.e., ??(x1, x2) = 1. Further details on the mathematical
 basis of the algorithms on which our protocol is based as well as their
 formal proofs are given in the cited publications.
 6The algorithm to construct a valid RSA signature from (t + 1) partial
 signatures and the verification procedure can be found in [13, Section III.A].

 4) Resource Access:
 In this phase, to avoid traceability and linkability,
 every single time that a consumer user U , who wants
 to gain access to ?, must generate and commit to
 a new set of session secret random values together
 with commitments on the credential AACU . Thus,
 once U has constructed and sent the corresponding
 commitments to one of the co-owners P providing ?,
 U and P engage in the following four zero–knowledge
 proofs of knowledge (ZKPoKs) to prove the following
 statements: (i) U proves that the private attributes
 (x1, x2) encoded in its AACU satisfy the boolean
 formula ??(x1, x2) = 1, without disclosing the ac-
 tual attribute values (x1, x2), (ii) proves that all the
 session values and commitments are valid and fresh
 to the actual instance of the Resource Access phase
 (so no message is being relayed), (iii) proves that
 the signature on AACU is valid (without disclosing
 the credential AACU ), and (iv) proves that U knows
 a newly chosen session value y involved in all the
 previous the ZKPoKs and commitments. This session
 value is newly and randomly chosen by U in each
 instance of the Resource Access phase and offers
 unlinkability between two different access sessions.
 We refer the reader to [11, Section 4.2]-Showing
 possession of credentials for a complete description
 of this phase.
 C. Discussion
 Note that our protocol endorses the following important
 properties:
 • Scalability on the number of resources: A user can use
 its AACi to anonymously and unlinkably gain access
 to either a single private shared resource or a collection
 of resources which share both the access policy and the
 group of owners.
 • Scalability on the number of access control policies:
 Since access control policies are represented as curves
 in the plane, a tuple of attributes could be at the
 intersection of two or more of these curves satisfying
 two or more policies. This way owners can construct
 a hierarchy of policies without having to issue new
 credentials to all request users.
 • Scalability on the number of owners. The system does
 nor present restrictions on the maximum number of co-
 owners of the same common resource.
 • Security threshold parameter t. The security parameter
 is chosen amongst the group of co-owners of a partic-
 ular private resource. However, experiments in Section
 IV show how the value t influences the system and the
 expected gain of each participant.
 In the following section, we apply Cooperative Game The-
 ory principles to construct a coherent framework and also to
 provide a formal analysis of the proposed protocol phases.
 More precisely, we characterize the existing cooperative
 requirements in the System Set-up and Policy Establishment
 phases as coalitional games, in which it is reasonable to
 assume that players (the owners) would converge to forming
 the grand coalition (involving all players). Furthermore,
 we also formalize the Credential Assignment phase as a
 cooperative game using the Shapley value of each player
 in the game to evaluate and analyze the different outcomes.
 The properties inherent to the Shapley value will allow us
 to make an estimation on the feasibility of the protocol and
 the different possible outcomes, for many different real-life
 settings.
 III. GAME THEORETICAL ANALYSIS
 We describe the game theoretical framework assuming
 that the involved owners who form a coalition can reach
 binding agreements to enforce coordinated behavior. In that
 case, we also assume that they can share the benefits derived
 from the execution of the protocol or the system globally.
 The analysis will be performed by representing every system
 phase as a separate cooperative game with transferable
 utility (a TU game).
 The System Set-up, Policy Establishment and Resource
 Access phases are represented by simple games7 in which
 the only “winning” coalition is the grand coalition (when
 all owners collaborate). Indeed, non cooperative behavior in
 any of the aforementioned phases will prevent our protocol
 from completion. In this article, we do not formalize the
 study of those two simple games. By contrast, our focus
 will be placed on the Credential Assignment phase, where a
 group of (t+1) owners is the minimum coalition required to
 sign friend-request-messages. In particular, we represent the
 Credential Assignment phase as a TU game in characteristic
 function form. Furthermore, we define the notion of value
 and in particular we rely on the Shapley value to provide
 a fair evaluation of the game played by different types of
 participants.
 In the Credential Assignment TU game that we define,
 not only the individual gains resulting from cooperation are
 taken into account, but also the cost and other parameters,
 such as the number of friends expected to require access to
 the resource, etc. In other words, since some players may
 contribute more to the coalition than others or may possess
 different bargaining power, it is needed to measure how
 important each player is to the overall cooperation, and what
 payoff can he or she reasonably expect. These measurements
 will let us reason about the suitability and rationality of our
 protocol real deployment.
 7Simple games represent situations in which coalitions are either winning
 or loosing assuming only two payoff values: 1 for winning coalitions and
 0 otherwise.

 A. Cooperative Game Theory and Shapley Value
 In game theory, a cooperative game with transferable
 utility is a game where groups of players (coalitions) enforce
 the cooperation and coordination of the members of the
 coalition and dictate the group behavior. Thus, a coalition of
 players cooperates, and obtains a certain overall gain from
 that cooperation. Moreover, if the players have a common
 currency that is valued equally by all, then the overall gains
 can freely be transferred among themselves. Formally,
 Definition 1 (Cooperative Games with transferable utility
 (TU games)). An n–player cooperative game in character-
 istic function form with transferable utility (TU game) is an
 ordered pair (N, v), where N is a finite set of n = |N |
 players and v : 2N ? R is a map assigning a real number
 v(S), called the value of S, to every possible coalition of
 players S ? N , and where v(?) = 0. The real number v(S)
 represents the reward that coalition S can achieve by itself
 if all its members act together.
 As previously mentioned, since some players may con-
 tribute more to the coalition than others or may possess
 different bargaining power, it is needed to measure how
 important is each player to the overall cooperation, and
 what payoff can he or she reasonably expect. Formally, let
 (N, v) be a given TU game, the question to be answered is
 to determine how the power is distributed over the agents
 involved in a situation. One possible answer to this question
 is given by the notion of Shapley value [15].
 Definition 2 (Shapley value for TU games). Let (N, v) be an
 n–player cooperative game in characteristic function form
 with transferable utility, then the Shapley value is a function
 ? : (N, v) ? Rn that associates (N, v) a vector ?(N, v)
 whose i-th component is given by the formula:
 ?i(N, v) =
 ∑
 S?N
 i/?S
 (
 s!(n ? s? 1)!
 n!
 )(
 v(S ? {i}) ? v(S)), (1)
 ?i = 1, . . . , n where s = |S| denotes the cardinality of
 coalition S ? N .
 The Shapley value is an index for measuring the power of
 players in a game. It computes for each player the average
 marginal contributions (mci(S) := v(S ? {i}) ? v(S)) in
 all possible coalitions.
 Regarding the Shapley value’s ability to promote fairness,
 Myerson [16] characterizes the Shapley value as the unique,
 efficient, symmetric value verifying the balanced contribu-
 tions property. Thus, we have the following properties:
 • Efficiency: implies that the vector of values exactly
 splits the total payoff of the game.
 v(N) = ∑
 i?N
 ?i(N, v)
 • Symmetry: implies symmetric players to be paid equal
 shares. If i, j ? N are symmetric (v(S ? {i}) = v(S ?
 {j}), for all S ? N \ {i, j}), then
 ?i(N, v) = ?j(N, v)
 • Balanced Contributions: implies that player i con-
 tributes to player j’s payoff what player j contributes
 to player i’s payoff.
 ? i, j ? N,?i(N, v) ? ?i(N \ {j}, v|N \ {j}) =
 = ?j(N, v) ? ?j(N \ {i}, v|N \ {i}),
 where (N \ {j}, v|N \ {j}) is the TU game played by
 N \ {j} players.
 B. The Credential Assignment Phase as a TU Game
 In this section, a Credential Assignment TU game is
 defined to represent the Credential Assignment phase. The
 characteristic function will be determined by the total ex-
 pected gain from the cooperation of (t+ 1) owners signing
 a new user’s access request, i.e., the benefits of protecting
 the resource minus the costs imposed by running the process
 of signing credentials. Additionally, the function will also
 capture the level of satisfaction achieved by the members
 of the coalition when the system is operating according to
 their expectations.
 1) Assumptions: We assume the following hypothesis in
 order to constitute the characteristic function and players’
 payoffs:
 Assumption 1 (Gain). A successful execution of the Cre-
 dential Assignment phase gives owners the opportunity of
 executing their privacy requirements on common shared
 resources and then preventing from non-authorized access.
 Since every owner is cooperative, a value bi will represent
 the gain for each participant i ? N in signing new friend-
 request-messages for friends of other coalition members.
 This payoff captures the cooperative nature and the interest
 of player i to assist other allied members’ friends.
 Assumption 2 (Costs). A successful execution of the Cre-
 dential Assignment phase involves players in incurring a
 computational and communication cost by signing friend-
 request-messages of other coalition members for a given
 resource and owner. The cost of signing one of these
 messages is denoted by ci which depends on each owner’s
 platform (i.e., PC, smartphone).
 Assumption 3 (Global individual gain). A successful exe-
 cution of the Credential Assignment phase gives owners a
 personal utility ui, which represents the gain for participant
 i ? N taking into account that the overall system is
 operating in a regular flow. The value ui represents the
 gain for each participant expecting friend-request-messages
 initiated by their own friends to be signed by the rest of the
6
 co-owners. It also represents the overall level of satisfaction
 or consideration for the global functioning of the protocol.
 Assumption 4 (Friendship connections). The value ?i rep-
 resents the number of friends that player i has and that
 are entitled to initiate the Credential Assignment phase by
 requesting i to collect enough signatures on the friend-
 request-message generated.
 2) Credential Assignment Game Characteristic Function:
 If a participant i ? N acts as the sponsor for one of his
 friends U , then i involves a group S ? N of co-owners in
 signing the anonymous credential. We define the total gain
 of S by:
 g(S) =
 ?
 ??

 0, if |S| 6 t
 ui +
 ∑
 j?S
 j 6=i
 (bj ? cj), if |S| > t
 being |S| > t+1, where t is the threshold security parameter
 defined in Section II. Otherwise, its total gain equals 0, since
 coalition S is not able to generate the necessary material to
 construct an anonymous access credential. However, since
 a highly connected owner (with high number of friendship
 connections) will act as an sponsor with a high probability,
 we define the expected total gain E of each coalition S ? N
 as follows:
 E[g(S)] = ∑i?S ?i?(N) ?

 (N, v) with player set N = {1, · · · , n}, and the charac-
 teristic function given by:

 For the sake of completeness, we include the mathe-
 matical proof for the computation of the Shapley value in
 Appendix A.
 3) Discussion: The interpretation of the Shapley value of
 each entity involved in the protocol is related to the propor-
 tion, on the part of that entity, of the total cost or losses
 in terms of global resources consumed or invested, when
 running one single instance of the protocol. The Shapley
 value provides fairness to the distribution of the total benefit
 (or cost), gained (or spent) globally for the functioning of the
 system, amongst the members of a coalition. In other words,
 each entity should contribute to the total amount of global
 cost, overhead or resources needed to execute the protocol
 successfully, according to the proportion dictated by its own
 Shapley value. Thus, in our particular setting, the following
 relations can be established:
 • Any increase in any of the ?i values increases the Shap-
 ley value of player i. Indeed, increasing the number of
 friends of any of the members of a coalition increases
 the global cost of the system (e.g., in terms of time for
 executing the protocol). The entity imposing such extra
 cost should then assume a bigger proportion of it.
 • An increase in any of the ci values decreases the
 Shapley value of player i. A participant with a high
 individual signing cost is individually contributing more
 to the global functioning of the system than other
 participants with lower individual costs. Therefore, the
 former should be compensated by the coalition by
 reducing the proportion i has to pay of the global
 system cost.
 • An increase in any of the bi values increases the
 Shapley value of player i. A participant benefiting
 more than the rest when signing single credentials is
 clearly more interested on the global functioning and
 operability of the system. In those terms, it should
 assume a bigger proportion of the overall overhead cost
 than the less interested players.
 • An increase in any of the ui values increases the Shap-
 ley value of player i. Similarly, deriving bigger benefit
 than the rest from the signing of one own friend’s
 credentials implies a greater interest on the execution
 of the protocol and this implies other participants can
 force this one to assume a bigger proportion of the
 global system overhead cost.
 IV. OUTCOME OF THE FORMALISM
 In this section, corresponding to the scope of this paper
 and, as a way to illustrate the outcome of our formalism
 (for the Credential Assignment phase), we choose a series
 of small communities which allow us to individually analyze
 and predict the expected contribution of different types of
 rational participants to the overall system. Note that the
 actual implementation and evaluation of the system is out
 of the scope of this work.

 In equal conditions, the Shapley value represents a fair distribution of global costs
 and benefits in terms of global system resources and overhead.
 Pi ui bi ci ?i Shapley Value Shapley Value in %
 P1 10 12 5 2 8 33.3%
 P2 10 12 5 2 8 33.3%
 P3 10 12 5 2 8 33.3%
 Total Shapley Value 24
 The Shapley value represents a fair distribution of global costs, assigning entities
 with a larger number of friends a bigger proportion of the global cost incurred by
 the coalition. In other words, P2 and P3 expect P1 to assume 51.04% of the total
 cost in terms of overhead and global resources consumed in running the protocol.
 Pi ui bi ci ?i Shapley Value Shapley Value in %
 P1 10 12 5 20 12.25 51.04%
 P2 10 12 5 2 5.88 24.48%
 P3 10 12 5 2 5.88 24.48%
 Total Shapley Value 24
 Players with higher cost when signing a single credential (for example, using a low
 powered device to perform the signature) are assigned the lower proportion of the
 total cost incurred by the coalition. In other words, P1 expects P2 and P3 to assume
 36.54% each, of the total cost in terms of global resources consumed in running the
 protocol.
 Pi ui bi ci ?i Shapley Value Shapley Value in %
 P1 10 12 15 2 4.67 26.92%
 P2 10 12 5 2 6.33 36.54%
 P3 10 12 5 2 6.33 36.54%
 Total Shapley Value 17.33
 Players for who signing a single credential represents a higher potential benefit must
 also be responsible for a higher proportion of the cost incurred by the coalition.
 Similarly, P2 and P3 expect P1 to assume the 40.58% of the total cost or losses
 in terms of global resources consumed or invested in running the protocol.
 Pi ui bi ci ?i Shapley Value Shapley Value in %
 P1 10 24 5 2 12 40.58%
 P2 10 12 5 2 10 29.71%
 P3 10 12 5 2 10 29.71%
 Total Shapley Value 32
 Players for who the well functioning of the system represents a higher potential
 benefit must equally be given a bigger proportion of the total cost incurred by the
 coalition. In other words, P2 and P3 can push or negotiate with P1 to assume up
 to a maximum of 37.50% of the total price of running the service.
 Pi ui bi ci ?i Shapley Value Shapley Value in %
 P1 30 12 5 2 12.44 37.50%
 P2 10 12 5 2 9.11 31.25%

 Figure 2: A few examples for coalitions of 3 players.
 Tables in Fig. 2 show simple and arbitrary values con-
 sidered for a small scenario where n = 3 is the number
 of players or participants (denoted by Pi in the figure) and
 t = 1 (at least two signers are needed) is the threshold
 parameter. In all cases the Shapley value is computed and
 interpreted, giving a fair estimate of the gains and losses
 incurred by each participant of a coalition in different
 situations.
 Furthermore, to illustrate the outcome of our formalism
 with a larger number of co-owners, different groups of
 n = 12 of co-owners are chosen. A formal evaluation is
 performed according to the following (see Table I):
 • Regarding the type of individual owners (two level
 grading, Low and High, is considered for each variable
 ui and bi):
 – A Beginner type of owner: a participant with
 ui(Low) and bi(Low). Someone with no previous
 experience using our access control protocol.
 – A Buddy type of owner: a participant with
 ui(High) and bi(Low). Someone with previous
 experience using our access control system, who
 assigns more individual benefit to having his/her
 friends gaining access to the private shared re-
 source than to having somebody else’s friends
 gaining access to the same resource. A Buddy
 favors his/her own friends.
 – A Socializer type of owner: a participant with
 ui(High) and bi(High). Someone with previous
 experience using our access control system, who
 assigns an individual benefit to having his/her own
 friends gaining access to a private resource that
 is equal to the benefit of having somebody else’s
 friends accessing the same resource.
 • Regarding computational capacity (two level grading,
 Low and High, is considered for each ci):
 – The value ci(Low) references a PC or any other
 device with high computational capabilities.
 – The value ci(High) references a smartphone or
 any other low-powered device.
 – Finally, ?i ? 1, . . . , n bi(Low) < ci(High).
 • Regarding the number of friends, four level grading,
 Very Low, Low, large or Very Large, is considered for
 each ?i.
 Note that the following series of experiments are also
 trying to establish how t affects the outcome of each
 simulation. For the sake of simplicity, we fixed n = 12
 and t = {3, 6, 10}.
 A. Scenario 1
 Given a group of Beginners, equally connected in terms
 of the number of friends, the curves in Figure 3–(a) show
 that the proportions of global cost assumed by each co-
 owner using a PC (solid lines) is greater than the one
 assumed by smartphone co-owners (dashed lines). We see
 how the proportions converge to be equals as t grows.
 Similar experiments with a group of Socializers or a group of
 Buddies also show that co-owners using PCs must contribute
 more than those using smartphones.
 B. Scenario 2
 Figure 3–(b) shows the distribution of the cost given a
 group comprised of the 3 types of participant, all equally

 circles (P4,8,12).
 connected in terms of the number of friends and with equal
 computation capability (all PC devices). We observe that
 how this distribution is almost even although Socializers
 must contribute more due to their desire to be highly visible
 in social terms.
 C. Scenario 3
 Given a group of n = 12 co-owners in which P1?4 are
 Beginners, P5?8 are Buddies and P9?12 are Socializers, we
 explore how ?i affects the distribution of the cost. In Figure
 4–(a) we represent all individuals participating in the system
 using a PC, whereas in Figure 4–(b) the device used is
 a Smartphone. In particular, when the number of owners
 involved in the signing process is low t = 3, we can see
 how participants who either by being Socializers (specially
 P11,12) or by having Very high number of friends (P4,8,12),
 must incur higher contribution to the global cost, in both
 scenarios. Moreover, as shown in simulations above, the
 Shapley value gets more evenly distributed as the number
 of signers grow up to the maximum. These results can be
 extrapolated to larger communities with similar distributions.
 D. Scenario 4
 Finally, we have also explored a mixed scenario of a group
 of n = 12 co-owners with the same configuration of types
 as in Simulation 3 but also considering different devices.
 Figure 5 depicts how participants with Very High number of
 friends must again contribute more, and Smartphone owners’
 contribution is generally lower than participants’ using PCs.
 These results can be extrapolated to larger communities with
 similar distributions.

 E. Application
 The simulations just shown serve as an example of the
 direct application of the formal analytical framework, with
 regard to the anonymous access control protocol proposed.
 Before participating in the system, co-owners can assess the
 level and cost of their contribution to the execution of the
 system. Although for each particular scenario, fairness is
 guaranteed (Shapley Value characteristic), owners can use
 this tool to evaluate each particular instance.
 V. CONCLUSION
 In this article, we have formulated a novel anonymous ac-
 cess control protocol as a series of coalitional games where
 the players are the owners of a common private resource
 in an OSN. Co-owners of a shared resource can generate
 by themselves an attribute-based boolean formula to con-
 trol the access to that common resource. This procedure
 requires the cooperation of all co-owners in both defining
 the access control policy to protect the shared content as
 well as in granting access to requesters, via anonymous
 access credentials. We have applied cooperative game theory
 concepts, in particular the Shapley value which distributes
 costs and losses in a fair manner, so assisting participants in
 estimating their expected gains and losses in each instance
 of the protocol. The application of this framework has served
 to illustrate the way in which cooperative protocols can be
 analyzed in OSNs. The same defined framework can be
 used to analyze the outcomes of cooperative interactions in
 other systems. Finally, as we illustrated the outcome of the
 formalism applied to small real settings throw light over
 the possibility of growth and expansion of the proposed
 cooperative management of privacy in a social network
 context.
