 AbstractÑLarge and complex data that becomes difficult to
 be handled by traditional data processing applications triggers
 the development of big data applications which have become
 more pervasive than ever before. In the era of big data, data
 exploration and analysis turned into a difficult problem in
 many sectors such as the smart routing and health care sectors.
 Companies which can adapt their businesses well to leverage
 big data have significant advantages over those that lag this
 capability. The need for exploring new approaches to address
 the challenges of big data forces companies to shape their
 business models accordingly. In this paper, we summarize and
 share our findings regarding the business models deployed in
 big data applications in different sectors. We analyze existing
 big data applications by taking into consideration the core
 elements of a business (via business model canvas) and present
 how these applications provide value to their customers by
 making profit out of using big data.

 I. INTRODUCTION
 A business model, as an institutionally constructed mea-
 sure, is an aggregation of a set of underlying principles
 comprising an organizationÕs overall strategy (depicted in
 Figure 1) that defines the extent to which the enterprise
 creates, delivers, sustains and even enhances different forms
 of value including, but not limited to, economic, social,
 cultural, technological, environmental or other forms of
 value. The term is used for a broad range of depictions,
 both informal and formal, to represent main characteristics
 of an enterprise, including its purpose, products and services,
 strategies, infrastructure, structures, practices, and processes
 and policies.
 A significant amount of literature exists on business mod-
 els, all of which intend to explicitly define and classify how
 companies realize their business mission and related activi-
 ties [1], [2], [3]. These studies differ in several respects. For
 example, some studies provided definitions or classifications
 of what a business model is whereas some studies enhanced
 such comprehensible definitions by presenting conceptual
 approaches to business models (e.g., proposing business
 model elements). On the other hand, some studies provided
 a set of tools or graphical representations to design business
 models. Even in some studies, evaluation metrics that can
 be used to assess the success of a business model were
 proposed. TimmersÕs study [4] which described a business

 model as an architecture containing different elements such
 as product, service, information flows, and business actors
 is considered as the first study on business models.
 Osterwalder, based on his earlier work on business model
 ontology [5], proposed a strategic management template
 named as business model canvas in 2010 [6]. As shown in
 Figure 2, the business model canvas describes nine essential
 components of a business where the overall layout outlines
 how these pieces fit together. Since its introduction, the
 template and the underlying idea have quickly spread all
 around the world and leading companies like P&G and
 Nestle have started using the canvas in order to create
 new strategies for earning money. The canvas helped these
 companies to move to business model thinking from product
 centric thinking.
 In todayÕs world, big data is arguably important and often
 exploited for two main reasons. First, big data is utilized
 by companies for analytic purposes such as deriving useful
 insights about their businesses and supporting their higher-
 level decision making. Second, big data enables the devel-
 opment of applications and real-time services that leverage
 massive amounts of electronic data in order to present
 customers with value (e.g., intelligent services, efficiency,
 and entertainment) that would not be possible without the
 availability of such data. All big data applications have to be
 equipped with a number of capabilities such as visualizing
 and personalizing data, integrating different sets of data, and
 exploring and analyzing data in a timely manner.
 In this paper, we explore the phenomenon of business
 models in big data applications and services such as location
 based services, medical services, and retail services. Our aim

 is to explain and draw attention to the impact of big data
 on deployed business models. We analyze a number of big
 data applications and focus on their business models from
 the business model canvas perspective [6]. For each building
 block of the canvas, we summarize the corresponding strate-
 gies and activities of big data applications. We believe that
 this analysis highlights several distinct aspects of big data
 applications as compared to traditional data applications.
 II. BUSINESS MODEL CANVAS
 We surveyed a range of big data applications focusing
 on their activities from the business model canvas perspec-
 tive [6]. The canvas enabled us to analyze the sustained
 business models in terms of elementary constructs such
 as key resources, target customers, and revenue channels.
 This section describes the building blocks of the canvas and
 presents our survey results that describe the money earning
 logic of big data applications.
 A. Value Propositions
 Value propositions can be described as products and
 value-added services delivered by a company to fulfill cus-
 tomer needs and are of value to customers. With the use of
 big data, many innovative and value-added applications have
 become possible that were unlikely to be imagined using
 traditional data paradigms. Many applications have started
 to emerge in the market ranging from transportation to health
 care. In this section, we present the value offered by big data
 applications in different sectors.
 ¥ Location Based Services:
 The large availability of location data due to GPS enabled
 devices such as smart phones has made many innovative
 applications possible. Smart routing applications use big
 amounts of data from vehicles en route and other sources
 in order to estimate the traffic conditions and direct their
 users accordingly. Such applications have been increasingly
 utilized especially in large metropolitan areas that suffer
 from traffic problems. Some search engines (e.g., Google
 (www.google.com) and Yandex (www.yandex.com)) provide
 traffic-based map services. The Royal Institute of Technol-
 ogy of Sweden has developed an application which estimates
 how long it would take to travel from one point to another
 and gives driving directions to its users [7]. Other features
 of current smart routing applications include up-to-date in-
 formation about scheduled roadwork, points of interest, and
 weather conditions. Waze (www.waze.com) is a community-
 based traffic and navigation application recently acquired by
 Google. Its maps are created by the community and its users
 share traffic and road information. The application provides
 its users with information about their friends who drive to
 the same destination as well as real-time driving directions.
 Suggesting a form of transportation (such as
 taxi) is another use of big data applications in
 the smart routing domain. For example, CabSense
 (www.sensenetworks.com/products/macrosense-technology-
 platform/cabsense) uses tens of millions of GPS points
 from taxis in New York City to locate the best corner for
 finding a taxi nearby. Another innovative application is
 Street Bump (www.streetbump.org) which uses two sensors
 of a smart phone (i.e., GPS and accelerometer) during
 driving to automatically find and report potholes within
 the Boston city roads. Using this tool, the residents may
 improve their neighborhood streets and the governments
 may fix existing problems and plan long term investments.
 With the use of smart routing applications, a lot of gain
 has become possible in terms of time, oil usage, carbon
 dioxide emissions, etc. The potential global value of smart
 routing in the form of time and fuel savings is expected to be
 around 500 billion dollars by 2020 [8]. For each traveler, the
 estimated savings are 10 to 15 hours a year. The total fuel
 savings are expected as 150 billion dollars which correspond
 to a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of 380 million
 tones a year.
 Some platforms for location-based ratings and reviews
 also leverage massive amounts of data. For example,
 Yelp (www.yelp.com) with about 100 million monthly
 unique visitors helps people to find local businesses
 such as dentists, mechanics, and restaurants and to read
 corresponding reviews provided by the community. Another
 example is Foursquare (www.foursquare.com) which
 enables users to check in at venues nearby and rate these
 venues. These applications are helpful for newcomers of
 a neighborhood in exploring points of interests as well
 as residents in selecting services. The side benefits of
 such applications include convenience, transparency, and
 entertainment.

¥ Health Care:
 The increasing availability of health care data in the
 form of medical records, claims and cost data, R&D data
 from pharmaceutical companies, and other types of med-
 ical content has started to result in new types of big
 data applications, such as the applications that provide the
 analysis and aggregation of health care data as a service
 to third parties. These services can be used to improve
 clinal decision making, create preventive care programs, and
 help pharmaceutical and medical product companies in their
 R&D activities. For example, UFIDA Medical developed
 a medical information platform for a China city with a
 population of about three millions. The platform enables
 doctors to retrieve the medical history of patients including
 the treatments and prescriptions in real time [9] and provides
 data analysis and data mining solutions to its users.
 Big data applications in health care also include
 online platforms. As an example, PatientsLikeMe
 (www.patientslikeme.com) provides a platform
 to the community to share their health related
 experiences and hence help patients with similar
 diseases. This data is also shared with the industry
 for R&D purposes. There are platforms for
 communities of physicians such as Medscape Connect
 (www.medscape.com/connect), Sermo (www.sermo.com),
 and DocCheck (www.doccheck.com/com/). These platforms
 allow doctors to network with their colleagues, ask
 questions, and share their own perspectives with others.
 Ginger.io (www.ginger.io) offers patients an application that
 collects their behavior data via a mobile phone and gives
 them a better understanding about how their behaviors
 impact their well-being. At the same time, researchers can
 use a platform for collecting such data which enables the
 identification of novel findings and the providers can use
 this platform for tracking the data of their patients.
 In [10], new ways that big data can provide value in health
 care are described. Big data can help people in their own
 care and life style choices. The most appropriate and timely
 treatment and the right service providers can be selected
 with available evidence. With the exploitation of big data,
 the quality of services are expected to increase while the
 costs will decrease. As an example, more than $300 billion
 value per year is expected in the US with two-thirds of it in
 the form of reductions in health care expenditures [8]. It is
 foreseen that big data will trigger advancement in medicine
 and an increase in R&D productivity.
 ¥ Other Sectors:
 Innovative big data applications are also emerging in the
 retail industry. One type of application is price compari-
 son services which offer pricing information on products
 from different retailers. Studies have shown that consumers
 can save an average of 10% when they shop using such
 services [8]. For example, RedLaser (www.redlaser.com)
 allows customers to scan the bar code of a product using
 their smart phones and obtain price comparisons for the
 product together with other product information. Other big
 data applications in the retail sector include web-based
 marketplaces such as Amazon (www.amazon.com) and eBay
 (www.ebay.com). These services offer searchable product
 listings from a large number of vendors. Such services give
 price transparency to their customers and provide marketing
 and sales opportunities for niche businesses [8]. A large
 amount of product information such as consumer reviews
 are created using these applications.
 Big data applications can create value for several
 other sectors including the public sector, manufacturing,
 recruitment, etc. For example, WhereDoesMyMoneyGo
 (www.wheredoesmymoneygo.org) provides a web site for
 the analysis and visualization of data about public spending
 in the United Kingdom. In the manufacturing sector, data
 obtained from sensors in a product may be used to create
 after-sales service offerings such as maintenance services for
 automobiles [8]. Linkedin (www.linkedin.com) is a network
 of professionals with over 225 million members in 200
 countries. It provides access to professionals, companies,
 and job opportunities in different sectors. Considering these
 initial applications of big data, it is expected that many
 innovative applications will emerge with unforeseen benefits
 for their users and the community.
 B. Customer Segments
 Customer segment defines the type of customers that a
 company wants to address and attract by offering value
 propositions. In general, location based big data applications
 target mass markets. Smart routing applications target users
 of GPS enabled devices such as smart phones. It is expected
 that the use of smart routing is likely to grow as the pene-
 tration of smart phones and the use of free navigation appli-
 cations in these devices increase. More than 70% of mobile
 phones are expected to have GPS capability by 2020 [8].
 Additionally, the number of other navigation systems are
 also expected to grow. A target segment of location based
 applications includes governmental entities which track the
 traffic and road conditions and take precautions.
 Big data applications in health care sector target different
 customer segments including consumers, providers, payors,
 and manufacturers. Consumers include patients and people
 who aim to take an active role in their health. Providers
 include doctors and other health practitioners. According
 to a study [10], the majority of new big data applications
 in health care in the US target consumers and providers.
 With the availability of some big data applications, both
 consumers and providers have started to form large online
 communities. Governmental entities and hospital manage-
 ment units are interested in big data applications in order to
 manage and analyze the massive amounts of information and
 34
to improve the efficiency of their systems. Pharmaceutical
 and medical product companies and researchers consider big
 data applications as a source of data necessary for R&D
 activities.
 Some big data applications have multi-sided markets. As
 an example, platforms of patients need a large base of
 patients. They may also need pharmaceutical companies to
 perform R&D activities on the available data. Both segments
 are required for the success of such business models. Sim-
 ilarly, a lot of big data applications offer free services to
 customers and need advertisers for their revenues where a
 large user base is a necessity to attract advertisers.
 C. Channels
 Channels describe how a company gets in touch with its
 customers and delivers value propositions to them. There
 are several forms of big data applications. Location based
 services such as Yelp and Waze are usually provided as
 applications supporting at least one type of mobile oper-
 ating systems (e.g., Android (www.android.com) and iOS
 (www.apple.com/ios)). Some of these applications also have
 web-based versions for desktop and notebook users. In some
 cases, mobile platforms are necessary for their functionali-
 ties; as an example, Ginger.io uses sensors of a smart phone
 to track patient behavior.
 Big data applications may reach their customers through
 different channels. Web-based applications can be accessed
 through the product website whereas mobile applications
 are usually offered via one or more application stores
 such as Apple Store (store.apple.com) and Google Play
 (play.google.com/store). It is expected that many big data
 applications will be developed by entrepreneurs because
 application store model lowers the barriers to entry for inno-
 vative new players by providing ready sales and marketing
 channels [8]. Some big data applications targeting specific
 segments reach their customers through direct sales force.
 D. Customer Relationships
 Customer relationships refer to the relationship that a
 company builds and maintains with its customers. This can
 be considered as the lifeblood of a companyÕs business
 activity. Big data applications targeting consumers usually
 provide a self-service interface such as a map on which
 the user can navigate to learn about the traffic information
 or categories of businesses that may be used to locate
 specific businesses. Automated services may recognize the
 characteristics of individual customers and offer information
 related to transactions. For example, an application in the
 retail industry may recommend products a user may be
 interested in based on the previous purchases of the user.
 In some applications, companies co-create value with the
 community of customers. Examples include maps created by
 the community, community ratings for local businesses and
 health care information obtained from patient communities.
 The communities provide basis for these applications. At
 the same time, individual customers also benefit from the
 information created by the community that would not be
 possible without the formation of such a community.
 E. Revenue Streams
 Revenue streams describe the incoming money stream of
 a company by offering value propositions. It outlines the
 activities and pricing of the offered values with which a
 company improves its revenues. Some big data applications,
 especially the ones targeting the community, are free for
 consumers (e.g., Foursquare and Waze). These services
 mostly rely on advertising revenues. As an example, Waze
 has an advertising program that allows businesses to give
 advertisements that could be shown to drivers approaching
 the location of the business (e.g., a pizza restaurant) on
 the map or searching nearby. Foursquare introduced a new
 advertisement model where the advertisers are charged by
 the number of customers that visit their businesses after
 seeing their advertisement (not according to the number of
 advertisements displayed). According to a study [8], location
 based services are expected to create a value of $100 billion
 or more for service providers.
 Other sources of revenue include the provision of big data
 as a service to third parties such as the provision of health
 care data to medical product companies. In a community-
 based business model, individual consumers such as physi-
 cians and patients freely join the community, whereas the
 companies may be billed for the usage of data created by
 the community. It is expected that there will be a market
 worth more than $10 billion by 2020 for medical clinical
 information providers which aggregate data and perform
 necessary analyses to improve health care efficiency [8].
 F. Key Resources
 Key resources are inputs and capabilities that a company
 needs in order to deliver value to its customers. Tangibles,
 intangibles, and people-based skills are particular kinds
 of resources required for creating value propositions. Big
 data applications require scalable infrastructures and dis-
 tributed platforms. They also need to adapt to the increasing
 usage requests. Applications may use in-house or cloud-
 based infrastructures. Middle class servers are increasingly
 used together with distributed computing platforms such as
 Hadoop (hadoop.apache.org). Applications also need to be
 developed in a distributed manner usually with real time
 processing capabilities. Data analysis and machine learning
 techniques are largely utilized in big data applications.
 There is a rising need for human resources specialized in
 big data technologies and data analytics, especially with a
 strong background in large-scale systems and data mining
 technologies.
 Large customer bases and communities are becoming a
 key resource for big data applications. Communities that
 35
create data are required for successful execution of several
 applications such as Yelp. There is a network effect where
 individual data provided by each customer creates benefits
 for both customers and the application providers over time.
 Besides, communities also have positive effects on the
 acquisition of new customers. The likelihood of a person
 to start using a particular application increases as more
 and more people in their social network start using that
 application.
 Financial resources required to enter into big data appli-
 cation business have decreased considerably with the use of
 cloud-based infrastructures and the application store model.
 Lastly, as a key resource, the availability and transparency of
 data in electronic form has vital importance. For example,
 there is an increasing need for the conversion of medical
 records into electronic form.
 G. Key Activities
 Key activities describe the actions that a company per-
 forms in order to create, market, and deliver value propo-
 sitions to its customers and make profit out of them.
 Businesses of big data applications need to continually
 develop and maintain their infrastructure, platforms, and
 applications. This is especially the case when the number
 of their users drastically increases and the underlying data
 gets much bigger along with increased access rates.
 Businesses need to continually improve their services
 with innovation; that is, they need to find new solutions
 to customer problems and create value in their lives as new
 competitors enter the market. Due to the application store
 model, some businesses of big data applications do not need
 to perform much marketing and sales activities for individual
 consumers. However, such activities may be necessary for
 software applications with specific target segments.
 H. Key Partners
 Key partners refer to the voluntarily initiated cooperative
 agreement of a company with other companies in order to
 carry out activities related to value propositions. Big data
 application companies may need to develop partnerships for
 the acquisition of data. In some cases, the data is co-created
 with online communities. However, in some cases, partner-
 ships might be necessary to obtain supplementary data (e.g.,
 partnerships with map companies and governments). As an
 example, Waze has partnered with the Operations Center of
 the City of Rio de Janeiro to alert drivers about major road
 closures during significant events. Similarly, some compa-
 nies realize partnerships with advertisement companies to
 display location based advertisements to their users.
 Many big data application companies work with appli-
 cation stores for marketing and sales support. They may
 also need to work with companies providing infrastructures
 and platforms. As an example, UFIDA Medical partnered
 with Intel for hardware platforms and Hadoop-based big
 data software platforms that are used in their application [9].
 Partnerships may also be necessary for the development of
 standards to combine data sets from different providers as
 in health care applications.
 I. Cost Structure
 Cost structure describes the costs incurred by a company
 for delivering value propositions to its customers and doing
 all other business activities such as building partner rela-
 tionships and marketing. Big data applications usually have
 variable costs for infrastructure. The infrastructure costs
 increase as the applications get increasingly used (i.e., the
 data size and the number of requests per time units increase).
 These costs include costs of building and maintaining data
 centers (e.g., costs of servers, electricity, cooling, and the
 use of cloud services) and developing and maintaining the
 platforms and applications.
 In some cases, there may be costs for acquiring data
 required by the applications. As an example, health providers
 may have to invest in deploying electronic medical record
 systems which is estimated as $80,000 to $100,000 per
 bed in the United States [8]. There may also be costs for
 acquiring supplementary data such as costs for keeping maps
 up-to-date in smart routing. Other costs include sales and
 marketing costs which have decreased in some applications
 due to the use of application store model. In general, big data
 applications that target communities have lower customer
 acquisition costs as a consequence of network effects.
 III. CONCLUSION
 This paper has presented our analysis of business models
 used in big data applications varying from smart routing
 applications to health care services. To the best of our
 knowledge, this work is the first to study business models of
 big data applications according to the components of highly-
 reputed business model canvas. For each building element
 of the canvas (such as revenue channels and partnerships),
 we have summarized the activities realized by big data
 application businesses in order to provide value propositions
 to their customers. Overall, our analysis has showed the
 impact of big data on business models of data processing
 applications.
