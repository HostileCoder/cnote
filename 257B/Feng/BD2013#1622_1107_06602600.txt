Abstract—The purpose of this paper is to build a model 
consisting of young consumers’ personality, the use of online 
social network, and the luxury consumption tendency. We 
collected data from users of a popular online social network site 
in China, renren.com, which is Facebook copy. Over 150 
respondents from two leading Chinese universities, respectively 
located at Beijing and Shanghai, volunteered to participate in the 
survey. The results indicated that one’s extroversion strongly 
predicted the number of fans on renren. Number of friendship 
was also strongly associated with his/her luxury consumption 
tendency, after controlled the gender, grade, disposable income, 
and frequency of internet use. Moreover, the participants’ place 
of origin (big city vs. small town) served to moderate the 
relationship, i.e., for young consumers from small towns, their 
increased extroversion is associated with larger online social 
network, but at the cost of higher consumption of luxury goods, 
while the effect on undergraduates from big cities was lessened. 
These findings offer insight into the influence of consumers’ 
personality on luxury consumption and provide managerial 
implications for marketers to build luxury businesses in China.

I.  INTRODUCTION 
Despite the worldwide economic downturn in 2008, the 
luxury market has been thriving in recent years. According to a 
report by the leading consulting company Bain & Company, 
global luxury goods accounted for $ 212 billion in retail sales 
in 2012 and it is estimated that the market will grow by four to 
six percent per year between 2013 and 2015, pushing the 
market to between $240 and $250 billion by the middle of the 
decade. It is worthy that China has bypassed Japan as the 
sector’s second market, behind the United States. Chinese 
consumers now make half of the luxury purchases in all of 
Asia, and nearly one third of those in Europe. Globally, one in 
four purchases of personal luxury goods comes from Chinese 
consumers. 
Despite the dramatic growth of the luxury market over the 
past two decades, the literature remains scant (Truong, 
simmons, McColl, and Kithen, 2008). Besides, prior research 
mainly focused on demographic characteristics (gender, 
disposable income, social class); however, with the 
phenomenon known as the “democratization of luxury” 
(Truong et al., 2008), which means luxury goods have become 
more affordable and accessible to new customers, more 
consumers from various classes are willing and able to pay a 
price premium for higher quality, higher status products, thus 
becoming occasional luxury customers. Considering the trend, 
it is necessary for researchers to develop a good understanding 
of consumers’ underlying psychological factors. To address 
this knowledge gap, this study investigates the influence of 
Chinese young consumers' personality on the aspiration 
towards luxury goods.  
II. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK AND HYPOTHESES 
Our review of the literature begins with a discussion of 
luxury consumption. Next, we discuss the personality 
extroversion as well as its influence. Finally, we focus on the 
impact of place of origin. 
A. Luxury consumption 
From the perspective of consumers, there are several kinds 
of predictors of luxury consumption. Earlier research examined 
the demographics as antecedents. Researchers found that 
consumers’ income is predictive of luxury goods consumption 
(Dubois, & Duquesne, 1993). Eng and Bogaert (2010) also 
stated that, at the country level, there is a direct relationship 
between economic growths and increased spending on luxuries. 
Chao, & Schor (1998) found that race is positively associated 
with status consumption; specifically, compared to Black and 
Hispanic women, white women tend to engage in status-
 purchasing.  
Later studies attempted to examine the influence of 
psychological characteristics as antecedents. Based on an 
online sample of adults in the Southeast USA, Eastman, & 
Eastman (2011) found that, there was a significant negative 
relationship between the level of status consumption and levels 
of price consciousness, value consciousness and brand 
consciousness, indicating that those more motivated to 
consume for status are both more brand-name conscious and 
more likely to see a higher price as indicative of higher quality. 
Similarly, Zhan, & He (2012) demonstrated that value 
consciousness is positively related to luxury consumption 
among Chinese middle-class consumers.

Some researchers focus on the influence of values. Lee & 
Hwang (2011) showed that consumers who desire materialism 
and hedonism had favorable attitudes toward luxury 
restaurants, whereas consumers who desire uniqueness had 
unfavorable attitudes toward luxury restaurants. Gil, Kwon, 
Good, & Johnson (2012) also demonstrated that materialistic 
orientation is a powerful force in developing positive attitudes 
toward luxury brands.  
Additionally, social influence and conformity account for 
why people engage in luxury shopping. For example, 
Kastanakis & Balabanis (2012) found that consumers’ 
interdependent self-concept was positively related with 
bandwagon luxury consumption, which indicates people 
consume luxury goods to pursue perceived social value. Shukla 
(2011) found that normative interpersonal influences were 
significant antecedents of luxury consumption across nations. 
Zhan, & He (2012) also demonstrated that susceptibility to 
normative influence is a key predictor for Chinese consumers. 
Although much has been learned about the luxury 
consumption, little research had addressed the issue of 
consumers’ personality, which has been proven significant 
influencing factors of consumer behavior. 
B. The influence of extroversion on luxury consumption 
This study attempts to construct the relationship between 
personality and luxury consumption tendency. In this research 
we introduced extroversion as a determinant of luxury 
consumption tendency. Extroversion is one of the traits of Big 
Five Factor model, consisting neuroticism, extraversion, 
agreeableness, openness, and consciousness (Goldberg, 1992), 
which have been identified in numerous studies as the most 
salient dimensions of personality. 
Extraversion is distinguished by sociability, positive 
affectivity, assertiveness and confidence. Although previous 
research has not examined the relationship between 
extraversion and luxury consumption, we argue that several 
reasons make extroversion a good predictor of luxury 
shopping. First, extrovert individuals tend to be talkative and 
socially ascendant, they prefer interpersonal interaction and 
more importantly, they like to be the center of conversation 
(Costa & McCrae, 1992). As a consequence, luxury goods 
would make extroverts attract more attention from friends as 
well as strangers. Second, Extraverts are cheerful and 
optimistic individuals hence have a tendency to experience 
more positive emotions (Costa and McCrae 1980). Researchers 
indicated that extraversion is positively related to hedonic 
shopping values (Guido, 2006) and brand passion (Matzler et 
al., 2007). With the superior quality and aesthetic, luxury goods 
provide consumers positive experience, which is what 
extroverts are seeking. Finally, Individuals with high scores on 
extraversion have been characterized as assertive, forceful and 
ambition. Since luxury goods usually signal status or wealth, 
extroverted consumers may do luxury shopping to enhance 
their image.  
Relying on the analysis above, we suggested the 
hypothesis: 
H1: Individuals’ extroversion is positively related to luxury 
consumption tendency. 
C. Use of social network as mediator 
Besides the main effect, we attempt to explore the possible 
influencing mechanism of extroversion on luxury shopping. As 
mentioned above, extroverts prefer making friends; for the 
young generation, extraverted individuals are more likely to be 
active in social networks and have more friends. Meantime, 
past research found that consumers’ extraversion is positively 
related to their brand evangelism, which means advocating for 
a product to people around (Matzler et al., 2007). To some 
extent, online social network provides paths for extroverts to 
sharing (or even showing off) what they shopped. In this light, 
we hypothesize the mediation effect: 
 H2: Individual’s use of social network will mediate the 
relationship between extroversion and luxury consumption 
tendency. 
D. Place of origin as moderator 
Aside from the main effect of personality, this paper aims 
to explore whether such effect will differ for people coming 
from cities and town. For young people born and raised in 
small towns, when they come to large cities for colleges or 
work, they usually feel the shock brought by unfamiliar city 
life, which is totally different from the past quiet town life. For 
example, women who live in urban and suburban areas are 
more status-conscious than those in rural areas (Chao, & Schor, 
1998). When the new comers would try to adapt to the city and 
build the new identity, luxury or status goods may be a good 
choice with their meanings of success or status. Image a girl 
from a small town in Minnesota the first time in her life and go 
to New York University, a Gucci bag may give her some 
confidence in a subtle manner.   
Researchers demonstrated there are upwards purchases 
concerning the luxury. Lee & Hwang (2011) found that low 
income populations exhibited more unfavorable attitudes 
toward luxury restaurants than did middle and high income 
populations. More research demonstrated the compensation 
mechanism when examining the motivation for luxury and they 
found that individuals consume status-infused products for 
their reparative effects on the ego (Braun, & Wicklund, 1989; 
Sivanathan, & Pettit, 2010). 
In this light, for young people who were not born at large 
cities, the city life would drive their willingness to spend on 
high-status goods, especially for extroverted people who desire 
to grasp the attention and build social network in a short time. 
Following this logic, we suggested below: 
H3: Individuals’ place of origin will moderate the influence 
of extroversion on luxury shopping; specifically, for consumers 
from small towns (versus big cities), the relationship between 
extroversion and luxury consumption tendency would be 
stronger.   
III. METHODOLOGY 
A. Participants and procedures 
Over 150 respondents volunteered to participate in the 
survey. They come from two leading Chinese universities, 
respectively located at Beijing and Shanghai, two leading cities 
in China. With the various place of origin, college students 
make a good sampling population. A self-report, paper and 
pencil survey instrument was used to collect data. The sample 
has 119 female students and 33 female students between 18 
and 22 years of age.  
B. Measures 
1) Extroversion. The construct was measured by the 10-
 items Extroversion Subscale from Goldberg’s Big Five 50 
personality markers (1992). The adjective-anchored bipolar 
rating scales ranges from 1 (very Trait A), to 7 (very Trait B). 
Samples of the adjectives include unenergetic-energetic, and 
silent-talkative. Higher score represents higher extroversion. 
Alpha coefficient for this scale was 0.90, indicating high 
internal consistency. 
2) Use of social network. Participants were asked to report 
their friends on the most popular online social network site 
among Chinese college students, renren.com, which is 
Facebook copy.  
3) Luxury consumption tendency. Considering college 
students could not afford luxury goods, we measure the 
tendency by asking participants to list the luxury brands they 
could remember. Some participants just reported Louis 
Vuitton, Gucci, but some can list Bottega Veneta, prada and 
mont blanc. The average number of brands is 5.97(SD=4.19).  
4) Place of origin. We asked students to answer the 
question, “Generally, where do you think you come from, big 
city or small town?” It is a dummy variable. 
5) Control variables. Control variables include 
participants’ gender, grade, disposable income, and the 
frequency of internet use. 
IV. RESULTS 
We used SPSS to analyze the data. To examine H1, luxury 
consumption brands were regressed after controlling gender, 
grade, disposable income and internet use, F(5, 135)=3.76, 
p<0.01, and the standardized coefficient of extroversion was 
0.16, t=1.96, p<0.05. H1 was supported. 
To examine the mediation effect of individual’s use of 
social network between extroversion and luxury consumption 
(H2), we followed the procedures recommended by Baron and 
Kenny (1986). First, a regression of number of friends at social 
network was conducted on extroversion, F (1, 133) =4.69?
 p<0.05?R2=0.03?and the standardized coefficient was 0.18, 
t=2.16?p<0.05. Second, luxury consumption was regressed on 
extroversion after controlling demographics, F (5, 135) =3.76, 
p<0.01, while F change=3.84, p<0.05, R2change=0.03, and the 
standardized coefficient of extroversion was 0.16? t=1.96, 
p<0.05. Third, luxury consumption was regressed on friends at 
social network after controlling demographics, F(5 ?
 123)=4.87?p<0.01, R2=0.17?while F change=11.64, p<0.01, 
R2 change=0.08, and the standardized coefficient of friends at 
social network was 0.29, t=3.41? p<0.01; Finally, luxury 
consumption tendency were regressed on control variables, 
extroversion and number of friends at social network, F(6, 
122)=4.53, p<0.01?R2=0.18?and the standardized coefficient 
of extroversion’s effect on luxury shopping was reduced from 
0.16 to 0.14?t=1.60?n.s, while the coefficients of friends at 
social network was 0.27, t=3.12, p<0.01. From the above 
analysis, we found that number of friends at social network 
was a full mediator between extroversion and individual 
outcomes, supporting H2. Figure 1 demonstrates the mediation 
effect. 
 
Figure 1.  Mediation effect 
Using correlation analysis, we checked the moderating 
effect of undergraduates’ place of origin on the relationship 
between extroversion and luxury consumption. For 
undergraduates from large cities, there is no significant 
relationship between their extroversion and number of friends 
on social network (r= 0.02, n.s) as well as extroversion and 
luxury consumption (r=0.01, n.s), while for undergraduates 
from small town, the correlation is 0.22 (p<0.05) and 0.29 
(p<0.01) respectively. The analysis supported H3. 
V. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS 
A. Conclusions 
In this study we investigate the role of one personality trait 
(extraversion) as antecedents of luxury consumption tendency, 
which has been neglected so far. The results indicated that 
one’s extroversion strongly predicted the number of fans on 
renren. Number of friendship was also strongly associated with 
his/her luxury consumption tendency, after controlled the 
gender, grade, disposable income, and frequency of internet 
use. Moreover, the participants’ place of origin (big city vs. 
small town) served to moderate the relationship, i.e., for young 
consumers from small towns, their increased extroversion is 
associated with larger online social network, but at the cost of 
higher consumption of luxury goods, while the effect on 
undergraduates from big cities was lessened. 
B. Theoretical implications 
This research makes two important contributions to the 
luxury marketing literature. First, our findings provide 
evidence of a relationship between consumers’ personality and 
luxury consumption buying behavior, and the intensity of 
Individuals’ 
extroversion

social network use mediated the relationship, which is 
consistent with the arguments of personality psychology that 
extroverts tend to make friends and have a greater desire for 
goods which grasps others’ attention. Furthermore, the 
relationship is stronger for young students from small town 
rather than large cities, since they have greater motive to bridge 
social capital via social network and enhance their self-esteem 
via luxury consumption, which demonstrates the compensation 
mechanism of luxury or status consumption. 
C. Practical implications 
The current research demonstrates that, when the luxury 
brands intend to target potential luxury consumers, number of 
friendship on online social network would be a strong predictor, 
in that such consumers may score high on extroversion, which 
increases the likelihood of sharing or showing off goods on 
internet and luxury consumption tendency. We suggest that 
luxury brand develop specific marketing strategy towards the 
young consumers, for example, online marketing education and 
online games towards the intense social network users. 
D. Limitation and future research 
One limitation of the study is that the sample was 
predominately college students. Future research is needed to 
determine if the same relationship hold for a more diverse 
population. Additionally, researchers should further explore the 
influencing mechanism of extroversion aside from use of social 
network.
