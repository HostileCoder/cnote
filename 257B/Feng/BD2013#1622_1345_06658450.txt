Abstract- This paper summarizes the scaling challenges of the 
conventional 2D floating-gate cell NAND flash memories [1, 2]. 
The scaling trends and limits of the bulk and SOI NAND flash 
memories are investigated in terms of short channel effects and 
channel boosting leakage from 20nm to below 10nm generation 
using 3D-device simulation. In the bulk NAND cell, 13nm 
generation is the scaling limit for realizing both channel boosting 
during program-inhibit and SCE suppression. The SOI NAND 
cell scaling limit is decreased to 8nm generation. Then, scaling 
problems and device design for 3D-stackable NAND flash 
memory are investigated [3]. Control gate length (Lg) and spacing 
(Lspace) are paid attention since they can be separately varied in 
3D NAND and significantly affect the cell area of the 3D NAND 
as well as the electrical characteristics. Lg and Lspace should be the 
same to cope with the tradeoff between memory window and 
disturbance. If the number of stacked layers is 18 with the layer 
pitch of 40nm, the effective cell size of the 3D NAND corresponds 
to that of 15nm planar NAND technology. Then, this paper 
discusses an error prediction (EP) low density parity check 
(LDPC) error correcting code (ECC) which realizes an over 10-
 times extended lifetime [4, 5]. As the design rule shrinks, the 
floating gate (FG)-FG capacitive coupling among neighboring 
memory cells seriously degrades the memory cell reliability. The 
EP-LDPC ECC calibrates the inter-cell coupling without access 
time penalty.  Finally, this paper overviews a state-of-the-art 
hybrid memory solution with storage class memory (SCM) and 
NAND flash memory for the big data solid-state storage system [5, 
6]. Data fragmentation of MLC NAND flash memory is 
suppressed and efficient MLC NAND flash usage is realized by 
storing small hot data to SCM. The 3D TSV hybrid SSD realizes 
11 times performance increase, 6.9 times endurance enhancement 
and 93% write energy reduction. 
 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
 
SSDs and emerging storage class non-volatile memories 
such as PCRAM, ReRAM and MRAM have enabled 
innovations in various nano-scale VLSI memory systems for 
personal computers, smart phones, tablets and enterprise 
servers. There is a strong demand for continuous scaling in 
floating-gate (FG) type NAND flash memories below 20nm 
generation. However, serious program disturb errors due to the 
interferences from neighboring cells [7-10] become prominent. 
On the other hand, channel engineering and its scaling 
limitation in NAND flash memory cells are also concerns [11, 
12]. Due to the large EOT (16~20nm) in NAND cells, short 
channel effect (SCE) is degraded in scaled generations. As a 
result, DIBL induced program disturb has been reported [13]. 
Also, operation margins may decrease in MLC technologies 
since large S-factor worsens on/off current ratio [14]. 
However, suppressing SCE by high channel doping 
concentration leads to junction leakage during program-inhibit 
in bulk NAND flash memories [11].  
A thin body, thin BOX fully depleted SOI NAND flash 
memory is one of the candidates for the future scaled NAND 
flash memory for the excellent SCE controllability [13, 15]. 
Moreover, the drawbacks of thin body SOI transistors such as 
high parasitic resistance, low VTH controllability by channel 
doping and VTH increase by quantum confinement are less 
critical in the NAND flash memory than in logic device 
because the NAND flash memory does not require high cell 
current during the read and precise initial VTH control (VTH is 
controlled by the amount of electrons in the FG).  
 
 
II. SCALLING CHALLENGES  
OF 2D-NAND FLASH MEMORIES [1, 2] 
 
In this section, the scaling trends of bulk and SOI NAND 
cells are newly investigated in terms of SCE and leakage 
during channel boosting from 20nm to below 10nm generation 
using 3D-device simulation [1, 2]. The SOI NAND pushes the 
scaling limit of the short channel effect (SCE) and channel 
boosting leakage from 13nm to 8nm generation.  
Fig. 1 shows the program operation of a NAND flash 
memory. In a program-inhibit bit-line, channel voltage of the 
NAND string is boosted up to more than 8V to avoid VPGM cell 
disturb. Thus, the junctions of the NAND cells must withstand 
high voltage stress. Otherwise, junction leakage occurs and 
program-inhibit fails because the channel voltage does not 
sufficiently increase. Hence, channel doping concentration 
cannot be increased in a bulk NAND cell for suppressing SCE. 
In SOI NAND flash cell, thinner BOX has better SCE 
characteristics while too thin BOX may cause BOX leakage 
during channel boosting. If there is no BOX leakage, channel 
leakage is greatly reduced because the junction area is very 
small.

Considering above, the device design is discussed. Figs. 
2(a) and 2(b) show the device structure of the bulk and SOI 
NAND flash memory cells at 15nm generation used in this 
simulation. Bulk source/drain junction depth Xj and SOI 
thickness TSOI are fixed to 6nm. Punch-through stopper (PTS) 
layer, where the doping concentration is higher than the other 
channel region, is added to the bulk cell. TS (distance between 
PTS layer and source/drain junction) is changed to control the 
SCE. Although SCE is better in smaller TS, the junction 
leakage increases. For the SOI NAND cell, TBOX (BOX 
thickness) is varied.

15nm generation for the 3D-simulation in this work. Punch-through stopper 
(PTS) layer is used in the bulk NAND cell to suppress SCE. 
 
Channel leakage during channel boosting of the bulk and 
SOI NAND cells having the same SCE characteristics are 
compared. Junction electric field (Ejunction) and BOX electric 
field (EBOX) are evaluated for the channel leakage. Although 
the bulk and SOI NAND cells have the same VTH roll-off 
characteristics, S-factor and DIBL in the SOI NAND cell are 
better. 
Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) show the potential profile during the 
channel boosting simulation at 11nm generation for bulk and 
SOI NAND cells, respectively. SCE in both bulk and SOI 
NAND cells are made the same as the case in 15nm generation. 
Source and drain voltages are set to 8V. In the bulk NAND 
cell (Fig. 3(a)), Ejunction is found to be higher than 1MV/cm, 
which is the critical value for the junction leakage. Thus, 
channel boost in the bulk cell fails at 11nm generation. On the 
other hand, EBOX in the SOI NAND cell is found to be below 
10MV/cm where FN tunneling starts to occur. Note that BOX 
is made of thermal oxide and its quality is higher than that of 
the oxide (typically TEOS) filled between the FGs and CGs. 
Therefore, no BOX leakage occurs even at 11nm generation in 
the SOI cell.

Figs. 4(a) and 4(b) are the Ejunction and S-factor as a function 
of TS in bulk technology, respectively, at 13nm and 11nm 
generation. Although Ejunction is below 1MV/cm except for 
TS=0nm at 13nm generation, Ejunction exceeds 1MV/cm at 
11nm generation for all TS. S-factor for 11nm generation is 
also worse than 13nm generation.

boost the channel by the junction leakage due to the high Ejunction. 
 
EBOX and S-factor in the SOI NAND cell as a function of 
TBOX are shown in Figs. 5(a) and 5(b). EBOX is still below 
10MV/cm at 11nm generation for all TBOX. S-factor can be 
also slightly improved by reducing TBOX.

 factor even at 11nm generation. 
 
The scaling trends for the Ejunction/EBOX and S-factor of the 
bulk and SOI NAND cells are shown in Figs. 6 and 7. The 
scaling limit of the bulk NAND cell from the perspective of 
the junction leakage failure is 13nm generation. In the SOI 
NAND cell, the scaling limit decreases to 8nm.

III. 3D-STACKABLE NAND FLASH MEMORY DESIGN [3] 
 
3D-stackable NAND flash memory (3D NAND) [15-18] 
has been attracting much attention to overcome the scaling 
limit of the planar NAND flash memory. In these devices, the 
number of stacked layers Nlayer is increased to reduce the bit 
cost instead of shrinking the size of cell area in planar 
direction using expensive lithography. Scaling and design 
methodologies for 3D NAND are needed because they are 
completely different from the planar NAND. Fig. 8(a) shows 
the simplified cross sectional view of the bit-cost scalable 
(BiCS) [16, 17] type 3D NAND. One of the problems of the 
3D NAND is the decrease of cell density in the planar 
direction. The BiCS hole must be filled with O/N/O film 
(~20nm) and silicon channel. Since the O/N/O film is not 
aggressively scaled to maintain memory window and 
reliability, the diameter of the BiCS hole is not so scalable. 
Therefore, Nlayer should be increased to compensate this 
drawback under finite taper angle ? in the BiCS hole (Fig. 
8(a)). On the other hand, since the minimal line and space 
lithography pattern is not required for the control gate (CG) 
formation in 3D NAND, CG length Lg and spacing Lspace can 
be separately chosen. This design flexibility is only allowed 
for 3D NAND. Thus suitable device design for 3D NAND can 
be explored in terms of Lg and Lspace. 
3D NAND scaling and design methodologies are 
investigated [17]. Comparing with the planar NAND, the 
requirements for the Lg and Lspace of the 3D NAND are 
comprehensively studied from the cell size and electric 
characteristics.. 
The effective cell area (Aeff) of the 3D NAND is discussed. 
Aeff is A/Nlayer where A is the cell area in each layer [19]. The 
Aeff of the 3D NAND in Fig. 8(a) is approximately given as 
(square layout is assumed [17]), 
Aeff = {2RB + 2Nlayer(Lg + Lspace)tan? + 2tONO + F}2/Nlayer  , 
where RB, tONO and F are the bottom radius of the BiCS hole, 
total thickness of O/N/O layer and feature size (spacing 
between BiCS hole), respectively. Fig. 8(b) shows the 
effective cell area as a function of Nlayer with various layer 
pitches (Lg + Lspace). eff for the planar NAND is also shown in 
the figure.

Nlayer. tONO=20nm, RB=10nm, F=40nm [5] and ?=1¼. (c) Required minimum 
Nlayer against technology node of planar NAND cell. 
 
The Aeff of 3D NAND strongly depends on the cell pitch. 
Also, from Fig. 8(b), increasing Nlayer becomes less effective 
for Aeff reduction. This is because the BiCS hole pitch 
increases as the total height of the 3D NAND increases in the 
presence of the BiCS hole taper. The required minimum 
Nlayer to achieve Aeff smaller than the planar NAND cell is 
shown in Fig. 8(c). To achieve effective cell size of 15nm 
planar NAND technology, 40nm layer pitch with 18 layers is 
required.  
In [3], Lg and Lspace design window for 40nm layer pitch is 
explored and achieved by 3D device simulations. Figs. 9(a) 
and 9(b) show the design window of Lg and Lspace for 3D and 
planar NAND. The criteria for unacceptable regions (shaded 
regions in Fig. 9) are assumed as follows; Vth roll-off < -3V, 
S.S. > 300mV/dec, Vth shift < 2V in the programmed cell, Vth 
shift > 0.6V by the neighboring cell and Eox_ngb/Eox_pgm > 0.6. 
From Fig. 9(a), Lg= Lspace=20nm (layer pitch of 40nm), is 
achievable in 3D NAND in terms of the electrical 
characteristics. Same Lg and Lspace are preferable to cope with 
the tradeoff between the large Vth shift for the programmed 
cell and the small Vth shift by the neighboring cell. For further 
improvement, the diameter of the BiCS hole should be 
decreased. According to Fig. 8(c), the evaluated device 
structure can realize 15nm planar technology with 18 layer 
stacks.

IV. ERROR PREDICTING (EP) LDPC ECC [4, 5] 
 
As the design rule shrinks, the floating gate (FG)-FG 
capacitive coupling among neighboring memory cells 
seriously degrades the memory cell reliability. To enhance the 
error correction capability, an LDPC ECC is proposed for 
1Xnm flash memories instead of the Bose-Chaudhuri-
 Hocquenghem (BCH) ECC. In the 2 bit/cell, 3 reference 
voltages (Vref) are needed for the BCH. The conventional 
LDPC requires many, e.g. 21, Vref to get accurate VTH 
information. The inter-cell coupling is also considered to 
calibrate the interference. However, the increase in Vref 
number requires more sequential read cycles. Assuming 50µs 
cell read time and 21 Vref, the read access time is as much as 
1050µs. In case of the 3bit/cell or 4bit/cell, the read access 
time increases by twice or five-times, which is unacceptably 
long. To realize both fast read and high reliability, the error 
prediction LDPC (EP-LDPC) utilizing only 3 Vref is proposed 
as show in Fig. 10 [4, 5].

The read is 7-times faster than the conventional LDPC. The 
EP-LDPC corrects errors most effectively because in addition 
to the VTH and the inter-cell coupling, the write/erase cycles 
and the retention time are considered for the calibration. As a 
result, over 10-times extended lifetime is realized. 
    Fig. 11 shows the hardware architecture of the SSD with 
ED-LDPC. The error prediction sequence is realized with the 
simple logic gates in the NAND controller. The additional 
NAND controller circuit area to the conventional LDPC is 
negligibly small.

V. HYBRID MEMORY SOLUTION WITH STORAGE CLASS 
MEMORY & NAND FLASH MEMORY [5, 6] 
 
There is a growing demand for a high performance, highly 
reliable and low power SSD. A 3D TSV-integrated SSD with 
hybrid memory configuration which uses storage class 
memories (SCMs) and NAND flash memories is a promising 
solution. Among various SCMs, ReRAM is the best candidate 
due to its high speed, low power operation and potentially 
high scalability [20, 21]. In [5, 6], the detailed specifications 
for the ReRAM and architecture for the hybrid SSD are 
proposed.  
The block diagram of the hybrid SSD is shown in Fig. 12(a). 
The ReRAM uses NAND-like I/F. The polling (Ready/Busy 
status), which is used in NAND I/F, allows a variable access 
time. Fig. 12(b) shows the physical image of the hybrid SSD 
with TSVs.

Physical image of the proposed SSD. 
 
In [5, 6], three data management algorithms are proposed for 
the 3D hybrid SSD. The key idea is to store hot fragmented 
data less than the page size to ReRAM and use MLC NAND 
for sequential data. To evaluate the hybrid 3D hybrid NAND 
SSD a TLM (transaction level modeling) -based SSD emulator 
that can comprehensively simulate performance, energy 
consumption and P/E cycles has been developed. The results 
for the write performance, write energy and average P/E 
cycles are shown in Fig. 13.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 13 (a) Write performance, (b) write energy and (c) average P/E cycles of 
the conventional and hybrid SSDs. The horizontal axis for (a) and (c) is the 
data size written to the SSD normalized by the SSD MLC NAND total 
capacity. 100ns/sector is assumed for the ReRAM write and read latency. 
 
Compared with the conventional MLC NAND SSD, the 
hybrid SSD shows 11 times higher performance and 79% 
lower write energy (Figs. 13(a) and 13(b)). By using 3D TSV 
interconnects, the I/O energy is reduced by 27 times because 
the huge capacitance of the wire bonding is almost eliminated. 
As a result, the total SSD energy reduction reaches 93%. 
Furthermore, the slope of the average MLC NAND P/E cycles 
is decreased by 6.9 times in Fig. 13(c) by the hybrid SSD. This 
directly corresponds to a reduction in the replacement cost of a 
SSD storage system because the slope determines the aging 
speed of the SSD. In ReRAM, a data fragmentation does not 
occur because the partial overwrite is possible. As a result, the 
slope of the ReRAM P/E cycles is limited to 28 times of that 
of the MLC NAND in the hybrid SSD. Assuming MLC 
NAND endurance of 3?103, the required P/E cycles for 
ReRAM is less than 105, which is acceptable for the ReRAM 
device characteristics. Fig. 14 shows the valid page map of the 
conventional and hybrid SSD. The valid pages are scattered in 
the conventional SSD indicating that frequent overwrites have 
occurred to the MLC NAND. On the other hand, the hybrid 
SSD efficiently uses ReRAM and shows less fragmentation of 
MLC NAND because overwrites to MLC NAND are 
suppressed.

Fig. 14 Comparison of the SSD valid page location. 
 
The required ReRAM latency to obtain sufficient 
improvements is also investigated in [5, 6]. Fig. 15 shows the 
SSD write performance and energy as a function of the 
ReRAM write latency. ReRAM read latency is also varied. 
From the figures, both ReRAM write and read latency should 
be less than 3us to maintain high performance and low power 
operation. Considering 50ns write pulse, the 3us access is 
achievable for ReRAM in write verify operation.

VI. CONCLUSION 
 
   Scaling challenges of 2D and 3D NAND flash memory and 
solution for the scaling blockage are discussed. The scaling 
trends and limits of the bulk and SOI NAND flash memories 
are investigated in terms of short channel effects and channel 
boosting leakage from 20nm to below 10nm generation using 
3D-device simulation. In the bulk NAND cell, 13nm 
generation is the scaling limit for realizing both channel 
boosting during program-inhibit and SCE suppression. The 
SOI NAND cell scaling limit is decreased to 8nm generation.  
Then, scaling problems and device design for 3D-stackable 
NAND flash memory are investigated. If the number of 
stacked layers is 18 with the layer pitch of 40nm, the effective 
cell size of the 3D NAND corresponds to that of 15nm planar 
NAND technology.  
An error prediction (EP) low density parity check (LDPC) 
error correcting code (ECC) which realizes an over 10-times 
extended lifetime is discussed. As the design rule shrinks, the 
floating gate (FG)-FG capacitive coupling among neighboring 
memory cells seriously degrades the memory cell reliability. 
The EP-LDPC ECC calibrates the inter-cell coupling without 
access time penalty.   
Finally, the hybrid memory solution with storage class 
memory (SCM) and NAND flash memory are reviewed for 
the big data solid-state storage system. Data fragmentation of 
MLC NAND flash memory is suppressed and efficient MLC 
NAND flash usage is realized by storing small hot data to 
SCM. The 3D TSV hybrid SSD realizes 11 times performance 
increase, 6.9 times endurance enhancement and 93% write 
energy reduction.
