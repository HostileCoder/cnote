Abstract-Optical device is a telecommunications device that uses 
glass or plastic media made from silica and SiO2 to transmit data 
using light or LED (Light Emitter Diode) as the data is 
transmitted. Silica is one of the materials / media that serves as 
the transmission of data on the component microring resonator. 
This paper, investigate about the characteristic of microring 
resonator and specifically about the temperature effect on the 
cascaded parallel microring resonator. In this paper, also 
explains the resistance of the microring resonator for the various 
temperatures are given. How big is the change in the wavelength 
shift is happening and how the resulting output of wavelength. A 
cascaded parallel microring resonator is simulated using MatLab 
to analyze the temperature effect on the ring resonator 
components. This simulation also uses the couple mode theory to 
get the value of coupling coefficient. The wavelength used in this 
simulation was C-Band between 1530-1565 ?m. The simulations 
result shows the resistance of the components cascade-parallel 
microring resonator for a certain temperature. The simulated 
temperature are varied between 28o Celcius to 500o Celsius. 
Based on the simulation result it can be concluded that the 
change in temperature will change the resonance wavelength. As 
the temperature is increased, the resonance wavelength shifts 
(The increased temperature will affect to the shifting of 
resonance wavelength). The results of this study, a temperature 
parameters are given to the resilience of the microring resonator.

I. INTRODUCTION 
The devices used in communication system is a 
combination of electronic and optical technologies. In distance 
communication, optical fiber has been largely used and 
powerful tool which has been developed with very high 
performance respect to the transmission speed, the number of 
wavelengths and transmission distance. advantages of optical 
technology can be used with the bulk of technical performance 
is very good but the disadvantage is a very high cost. Today, 
metropolitan networks are using optical communication 
networks. Even in Indonesia has been implemented, the 
system uses fiber optics and many telecommunications 
companies that use them. 
The basic configuration of MR consists of a straight 
waveguide and a ring resonator. MR as optical filter has 
attracted much attention because of their high wavelength 
selectivity in combination with the small size. In general, a 
device with a full configuration that serves as a MR optical 
filter consists of two ports with a straight waveguide MR. MR 
devices can be assembled by a single ring or multiple rings in 
a serial or parallel configuration[1]. 
The background of this research, based on paper [2] that 
simulates the resistance temperature on MR. This paper is an 
outgrowth of the paper [2] on temperature resistance. The 
different of this paper with the previous paper [2] lies in the 
MR component. In the current study uses the concept of 
parallel MR series which will be described in chapter II 
(theory). In the previous paper [2], described the effect of 
temperature on single MR. This paper using a variety 
parameter of temperature as a function to determine how much 
of the effect of temperature on the result of transmission on 
MR. 
II. THEORY 
Frequency band used in this study were C-band ranging 
from 1.530 µm up to 1.565 µm. C-Band is the frequency band 
commonly in use in optical communications. Various 
frequency bands were shown in Table 1. 
Historically, the O band frequency, called the first, at 0.8-
 0.9 µm, however, the losses were high at this frequency so that 
the window is used primarily for short-range communications. 
Lower frequency (O band and E band) around 1.300 µm has 
much lower loss. Intermediate frequency (S band and C band) 
around 1.500 µm are most widely used. This frequency has the 
lowest attenuation loss[3].

A. Microring Resonator (MR) 
MR is a technique that uses the technique of coupling to 
transmit data to multiple destinations, such as for example is 
the WDM (Wavelength Division Multiplexing) 
communication system. employment system MR as well as 
WDM, ie several wavelengths (lambda) is transmitted in a 
single channel (mux). As an illustrative example is shown in 
Figure 1. For example, there are multiple wavelengths to be 
transmitted in a single channel (?1, ?2, ?3, ?4). If the 
wavelength used is ?3, then the other wavelengths (?1, ?2, ?4) 
will return and will serve as input to the transmission of data 
to transmit again. 
 
Figure 1. Illustration of MR 
Figure 2 illustrates the basic configuration of MR, 
which consists of unidirectional coupling between a ring 
resonator with radius R and Ei2 waveguide. R is radius of of 
ring and Ei2 =      
 
 
     . 
 
Figure 2. Model of a single ring resonator with one coupling coefficient[5] 
Defining that a single unidirectional mode of the 
resonator is excited, the coupling is lossless, single 
polarization is considered, none of the waveguide segments 
and coupler elements couple waves of different polarization. 
The various kinds of losses occurring along the propagation of 
light in the MR filter are incorporated in the attenuation 
constant, the interaction can be described by the matrix 
relation[4]: 
[
    
   
]    [
    
     
] [
    
   
]         (1) 
Et1 = Ei1 t + jEi2 K          (2a) 
Et2 = jEi1 Kt + Ei2 t          (2b) 
The complex mode amplitudes E are normalized, so 
that their squared magnitude corresponds to the modal power. 
The coupler parameters t and ? depend on the specific 
coupling mechanism used. The   denotes the conjugated 
complex value of t and ?, respectively. The matrix is 
symmetric because the networks under consideration are 
reciprocal. Therefore[4]: 
|t2| + |K2| = 1           (3) 
Ei2 = ? . e
 j?Et2           (4) 
From (1) and (4) we obtain: 
Et2 = 
   
        
         (5) 
This leads to the transmission power Pt1 in the output 
waveguide, which is: 
         
  
                      
                       
       (6) 
Where t = |t| exp (j ?t), |t| representing the coupling 
losses and ?t the phase of the coupler. The circulating power 
Pi2 in the ring is given by: 
         
  
          
                       
        (7) 
On resonance, (  + ?t) = 2 π m, where m is an 
integer, the following is obtained[4]: 
         
  
        
         
         (8) 
B. Cascaded-Parallel MR 
The parallel configuration in Figure 3, MR arranged in 
such a way that there is no direct interaction between the rings. 
MR parallel configuration offers more flexibility to the 
manufacturing process compared with other configurations.

Figure 3. Model parallel coupled MR 
Each MR refractive index or neff there. In the parallel 
configuration, the distance from one ring to another ring is 
very close. Value of L also determines the response filter and 
L being the circumference of the ring. Therefore, this distance 
should be chosen carefully to obtain the desired interference in 
the range of a specific wavelength. 
When optimizing the response filter design for a desired 
wavelength, L should vary like one other parameter. In 
addition to allowing precise phase relationship, the distance 
should be set to be large enough to avoid direct interaction 
between the ring with other rings[1]. 
Ei2 = Et2 exp   
 
 
               (9) 
Where L = 2πR, and R is radius of ring. By 
substituting equation (2) to (9), we obtain the transmission 
amplitude of an optical MR for cascaded parallel as follows : 
   
   
 
         
 
 
      
         
 
 
      
        (10) 
Where ? = exp (- ?πR) and ? = ? L. So, from 
equation (10), the power for the transmission of cascaded 
parallel MR is obtained[5]: 
       
   
   
   
                   
                 
          (11)

Figure 4. Flow chart process of research 
From Figure 4, shows the stages of the research work. 
For the first, we find neff values obtained from MatLab 
function and bisection method. After neff values obtained, and 
then find value of coupling coefficient from couple mode 
equation. Coupling coefficient value is inserted into the 
formula of MR. After that, conversion MR equation to 
cascaded parallel equation. And the last, the value of 
temperature effect on MR can be obtained from         
        . 
IV. DISCUSSION 
Figure 5 is the transmission power of MR as formulated 
in equation (10), with the parameters used are as follows : 
refractive index n1 (core) = 1.468 µm cladding refractive index 
n0 (cladding) = 1463 µm, h = 5 ?m wide. By Figure 5, shows 
the normal power of MR as a function of wavelength and it’s a 
single MR.

to avoid interference.

temperature and 3 simulated temperatures 
The  refractive index of the optical materials is not a 
constant parameter over temperature region in which the 
materials, such as crystals, semiconductors and glasses are 
used in different optical devices or system. The variation of 
the refractive index with the temperature at constant pressure 
is called the thermo optic coefficient. The analysis of thermo 
optic coefficient are essential to characteristic the temperature 
dependent nonlinear optical devices, the optical fiber 
communications system, semiconductor technology and the 
ultrafast femstone technology. 
The sellmeier coefficient at any temperature T are 
computed from the room temperature sellmeier equation and 
the smoothed dn/dt or C values by calculating refractive index 
from the relations[5]: 
                          (12) 
Sellmeier equation is the relationship between 
refractive index and wavelength for a particular media. This 
equation is used to determine the dispersion of light in the 
medium[6]. 
Figure 8, shows that the temperature affects the value 
of refractive index. The higher the value of refractive index 
with the increase in temperature occurs. By equation (11), we 
can get a way to give a temperature which will be used on MR 
that will make a difference in the stimulation of MR.

Figure 9, Explain the comparison between room 
temperature (T0=28

with width of core (h) = 5 µm, R = 14.7 µm. When the 
temperature is increased, the value of wavelength will go up as 
well (shifted).

temperature (T0=28

Figure 10 is the simulation result using difference ∆? 
between T1= 150
 o Celcius, T2= 325
 o  Celcius and T3= 500
 o 
Celcius. We can see the difference between the temperature of 
150o Celcius to 500o Celcius, when the temperature reaches 
150o Celcius then obtained a wavelength shift from 1539  µm 
to 1540 µm. When the temperature shifts to 325o, the 
wavelength shift up from 1.542 µm to 1.540 µm. And final 
temperature 500o Celcius with wavelength 1.542 µm shift up 
to 1.544 µm.

V. CONCLUSION 
Distance between the first ring with the next to be 
maintained, because if it does not cause interference or 
coupling process may occur in the transmission process and 
will result in failure in the transmission that allows the entire 
wavelength will be sent back as desired. 
Wavelength shift caused by temperature used in 
parallel cascaded MR is not too significant. The shift that 
occurs in only a few wavelengths. Although the optical 
communication system using light as the transmission, which 
use temperature is not too high, because the high temperatures 
may result in damage to optical devices. 
Temperature effect on the ring that has been heated 
MR has been demonstrated in the simulation study. When it

rings in the heating, the propagation constant in the ring will 
change as well. This condition causes the difference in the 
resonance wavelength than like before, when using room 
temperature (T0). Because of rising temperatures, the ∆? 
caused a shift in the resonance wavelength. In this study 
indicate that increased temperature 500o given in two rings 
(parallel cascaded) together ∆? yield 0.005 µm.
