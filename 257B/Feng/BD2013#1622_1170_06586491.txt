1 Introduction 
 
Company real estate (CRE) means the real estate 
such as land and buildings which owned by non-real 
estate companies in order to support the operation and 
development of the enterprise. There are a plenty of 
non-real estate companies hold the real estate asset as 
investment. Even for some non-real estate companies, 
real estate asset have been their largest asset projects. In 
some countries the real estate assets owned by some 
largest non-real estate company are compared in it in 
some big real estate (Liow, 1995). In Singapore, the 
average real estate investment accounted for more than 
40% of the company's tangible assets (Liow, 1995). 
With the continuous development and improvement 
of China's real estate market, more and more non-real 
estate companies start to focus on real estate investment, 
and held a large number of real estate assets. The 
Chinese enterprises began to be more and more attention 
to the diversified investment. From proportion of the real 
estate to the total assets (PAI%), we can find out the CRE 
is very essential to the non-real estate company. 
Why these companies are willing to hold so much 
CER? Many scholars put forward their views on this 
problem, According to Machlica and Borunch (1989), the 
reasons are: ? CRE is considered to be necessary in 
the operation of the business; ? CRE can be viewed as 
a figure on the balance sheets that reflect the company 
growth;? CRE can be treat as a source of the capital 
increase, investment income, and a sources of profit 
growth. ? CRE can be the source of cash when the 
economic downturn; ? CRE can bring the company a 
batter markets performance. But Bruggeman et al (1990) 
pointed out that because of a series of corporate 
restructuring in the US since 1980s, the traditional 
understanding that the non-real estate company who hold 
CRE can be able to obtain a comparative advantage in 
the market has been increasingly questioned by company 
managers. 
This paper will take the property-intensive non-real 
estate companies listed on the Shenzhen stock market as 
a sample to analyze the relationship between company 
estate investment and the real estate investment market 
performance and risk. 
In this paper, we will see the difference of CRE in 
different industries through comparative analysis of all 
the data. We take the empirical analysis methods and 
build the regression model based on the data from the 
listed non-real estate companies in Shenzhen Stock 
Exchange to analyze the relationship between a 
property-intensive non-real estate company’s number of 
CRE holding and it’s market performance. 
This paper includes five parts. Section1 introduce 
the basic situation of company real estate, the main 
writing motivation, Section 2 presents the sample of our 
research and do some statistical analysis to find out the 
data characteristic. We do Empirical Analysis and discuss 
the results in section 3, section 4. Section 7 summarize 
the paper and give conclusion.  
 
2 Methodology 
 
In this paper the data we used came from Shenzhen 
Stock Exchange’s mainboard non-real estate segment 
from 2007 to 2012. Because of the different asset 
structure companies from the finance and real estate 
segment should be excluded. Then we can get the panel 
data of 446 companies from 2007-2012.

2.1 Sample selection 
Consider that every company has different 
proportion of CRE, so the different size of CRE holdings 
may give different impact on the market performance. So 
if we focus on the property-intensive non-real estate 
company it is much easier to reflect the influence of the 
CRE holdings’ change. According to Liow (1999), we 
can use real estate asset intensity (PAI%) to judge if a 
company belongs to real estate intensive. But we think 
the investment property can better represent the CRE, so 
we use the investment real estate to calculate the PAI% 
of each listed non-real estate company. Calculate the 
average of the each listed companies’ PAI% from 2007    
to 2012. Take 20% as a cut-off point, if the PAI% is 
higher than 20%, it means the company is a 
property-intensive company. In this paper we use this 
proportion to filter the data, we can get the final sample, 
including 30 listed companies which come from four 
segments.  
 
2.2 Data characteristics 
Table1 listed the 30 sample companies’ distribution 
of gross real estate holdings (PTYABS) and the PAI% in 
2012. From this table we can see that the average real 
estate assets holdings of the sample companies reached 
0.28 billion, Total real estate assets achieved 4.9 billion. 
There are 15 companies' total CRE holdings more than 1 
billion and property made up about 50% of the sample. 
Figure1 showed real estate assets distribution. We can 
see majority companies’ PTYABS was on the area 
between ten million to fifty million, Second large 
number of companies had PTYABS between fifty million 
to two hundred million. All these companies whose 
PTYABS between ten billion to two hundred make up 
about two-thirds of the sample. There are only three 
companies’ PTYABS below one million.

In table2 we can see the situation of real estate 
assets holding and its proportion in 2012. We can find 
out the proportion of CRE varied from the lowest 
Industry companies’ 20.38 percent to the highest 
Commerce companies’ 49.57%, and the second  
 
 
Fig.1 Real estate assets distribution 
 
proportion is Composite companies’ 36.29 percent. From 
this table we can draw a conclusion that industry 
companies need less real estate. They just need like 
Office buildings, production plants, warehouses, etc. But 
the commerce need much more CRE for example they 
need a large number of commercial real estate, so that is 
why their proportion of CRE is the highest.

Table3 describes the sample companies’ real estate 
holdings in five years. The average value of company 
real estate increased from 0.152 billion in 2007 to 0.377 
billion, the increase rate is 148%.The average proportion 
of CRE in total asset decreased from  29.79% in 2007 
to 28.26 in 2012, In 2008 the proportion has reached to 
32.07% than went down. The growth rate in composite 
group is the fastest, its PAI% ranged from 22.93% to 
36.29%. The commerce group is the most 
property-intensive group with average PAI% is 47.56% 
over five years and its PAI% ranged from 38.61% to 
49.57%. The social service is the last property-intensive 
group its PAI% ranged from 23.76% to 7.86%.

the book value of the company. Real estate is the sum of 
all the company's buildings and lands. 
In particular, owing to the fact that some companies’ 
annual reports may be released during April or May, for 
the data of company's book value and the value of real 
estate, we use those from previous year for period before 
June and those from current year after June. Besides, in 
order to control the impact of current market factors, the 
model also takes  into consideration, which is the 
weighted market return of the re-investment of the cash 
bonus.

has different impact on different industries, l is the 
sensitivity for the ratio. Real estate has a positive effect 
on yields of stock if I is positive, and negative in the 
same way. To all Intensive companies in all industries, l 
is -0.19912 and insignificant, which means the corporate 
real estate has no significant impact on stock yields. For 
each specific industry, the regression results show that 
only the compos it industry has an l with t value greater 
than 2, which is significant at a confidence level of 95%. 
It indicates a positive effect of real estate on stock yields. 
The more real estate, the lower stock returns. 
Upon examination, p-values of I for the industry 
sector, the commerce industry and social service were 
0.4647, 0.5592, and 0.3036, respectively. These reflect a 
relatively obvious effect of real estate on stock 
performance, although not that obvious. And all of them, 
impact is negative. For industry, commerce and social 
services, the regression results show that the corporate 
real estate ratio did not affect its stock yields 
significantly. 
In summary, impact of real estate on stock returns is 
not significant for most companies. But it’s very 
significant for some specific industry (such as the 
composite). It also has considerable influence on some 
other industries (such as industry, social service).  
 
3.2 CRE and risks 
In order to further study the impact of corporate real 
estate on company stock fluctuations of returns, we 
establish the following four-factor regression model 
according to Fama and French’s (1992) idea. 
  (2) 
In this model,  represents the residual 
from the regression of the mean of yield of each stock on 
the mean of yield of the overall market from Dec.2007 to 
Mar.2012,  is the mean of book value of each stock 
from Dec.2007 to Mar.2012,  is the mean of market 
value of each stock from Dec.2007 to Mar.2012,  is 
mean of property asset value from Dec.2007 to 
Mar.2012. 
Based on the results in Table5, the parameter of 
Real Estate ratio regressed on the stock returns 
fluctuations is -2.3711E-10, and t value is 1.72 and p 
value is 0.06831 respectively, which is significant at a 
- 1680 - 
 
confidence level of 95%.

In other words, real estate has a significant effect on 
the changes in stock returns fluctuations. Because the 
changing in stock returns fluctuations represents the risk 
of the company's stock, we can get the conclusion: CRE 
has a significant effect on the changes in stock returns 
fluctuations under the consideration of all industries. 
Based on the results in Table 6,the parameter of 
Real Estate ratio regressed on the stock returns 
fluctuations in industry sector and commerce sector is 
-5.572E-14and -1.8824E-10 respectively, and t value is 0 
and 4.1 respectively, which is significant at a confidence 
level of 95%.

And real estate has a significant negative effect on 
the changes in stock returns fluctuations in industry 
sector and commerce sector. 
In other words, real estate has a significant effect on 
the changes in stock returns fluctuations. Because the 
changing in stock returns fluctuations represents the risk 
of the company's stock, we can get the conclusion: CRE 
has a significant effect on the changes in stock returns 
fluctuations under the consideration of all industries, that 
the CRE will bring reduction in the risk of stock 
significantly and reduces the volatility of stock returns. 
It is mainly due to the return of real estate 
investment has is relatively stable, while the companies 
in industry and commerce sectors mainly focus on 
business which is dependent on the company's real estate, 
so the expansion of the scale of corporate real estate 
(CRE) will increase the efficiency of operations and 
reduce its operating risk, so as to reduce the volatility of 
stock returns.  
 
3.3 Analysis of consolidated financial indicators: 
Altman Model 
In order to further study the impact of corporate real 
estate on company stock returns, we establish the 
following five-factor regression model according to 
Altman’s idea. 
  (3) 
Where X1 =operation fund /gross total asset value; 
X2 = retained earnings /gross total asset value; 
X3 = earnings before interest and taxes /gross total 
asset value; 
X4 = Market value of equity/ The book value of 
total liabilities; 
X5 = sales proceed/gross total asset value; 
If Z>2.99, then the enterprise's financial condition is 
good, the likelihood of bankruptcy is little. 
If Z<1.81, the enterprise is likely to be bankruptcy. 
Otherwise, it needs much consideration to 
distinguish the condition of the enterprise. 
We can see, the trend of z index is upward with the 
PAI% rising and it reach its top when PAI% is 60%. 
When PAI% exceeded 60%, the z index dropped. In 
summary, when PAI% is small, it has a positive effect on 
z index; when PAI% exceeds 60%, it has a negative 
effect on z index.

4 Conclusions 
 
According to modern portfolio theory, people 
usually think that if the company holds a diversified 
portfolio including CRE, It will improve the company’s 
returns on investment. However, the empirical results 
show that the income of the property intensive non-real 
estate companies who hold a large number of real estate 
assets is not better than companies who have no real 
estate investment. Through the analysis of the data of the 
listed companies in the Chinese market we found that the 
companies who hold CRE have a lower income and a 
higher risk. For the whole market this negative 
correlation is not very clear but it is very clear for 
individual sectors such as commerce, which is reflected a 
significant negative correlation with the number of CRE. 
In this paper, the data we use come from China 
Shenzhen Stock Exchange listed non-real estate 
companies on the Main Board. By using regression 
- 1681 - 
 
method we do further analysis of the impact to the 
company's stock market performance by holding 
corporate real estate (CRE). Empirical research in the 
two dimensions of the industries and regions showed that 
there is a significant difference between CRE holding 
and companies’ market performance in different 
industries and regions. The commercial industry is more 
significant than others, the higher the ratio of real estate 
lead to the lower stock returns. For all industries, there 
are also negative effects, but the impact is not very 
obvious. In the study of companies’ risk affected by the 
real estate company, we found that the CRE holdings 
have a significant impact on the volatility of stock 
returns, and there are significant differences in various 
industries. Among them, the impact on the commerce is 
the most significant. 
In the subsequent work, we will further do research 
on the real reason for why non-real estate companies 
held CRE, if the non-real estate companies did not get 
the return on risky investment by holding CRE that likely 
because these companies have other reasons to hold 
these assets in addition to the pursuit of gains, which 
may be due to other factors that affect the development 
of enterprises, and in the future we will do further study 
on this.
