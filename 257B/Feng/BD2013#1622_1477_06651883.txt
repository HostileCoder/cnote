Abstract 
Mixed signal ATE (Automated Test Equipment) often 
integrates a waveform sampler for testing UHF signals. 
While performing under-sampling, slow jitter greatly 
influences the captured signal which is reconstructed into 
a meaningful waveform by manner of coherent waveform 
reconstruction. The purpose of this work is to remove slow 
jitter effects from a high-speed digital signal measured by 
a waveform sampler and to reconstruct a clear waveform 
and eye pattern. The test signal is a PRBS (Pseudo 
Random Binary Sequence) bit stream with slow jitter. The 
PRBS signal becomes an extreme wideband multi-tone 
from a spectrum point of view, so capturing such a signal 
with a waveform sampler needs a carefully organized test 
plan based on the coherent condition. Measured data is 
reconstructed into a meaningful waveform by reshuffling 
the sequence of the sampled points. Jitter in the signal is a 
kind of PM (Phase Modulation) which smears the 
spectrum. So the point of processing is to demodulate the 
PM signal and then restore the original multi-tone 
components. An elegant mathematical equation is 
introduced to perform the carrier tone recovery. Because 
of the multi-tone structure, processing needs to be applied 
to each one of the tone components. First, the PM effect is 
removed from each tone, and then each tone needs to be 
compensated amplitude loss by referencing the original 
tone power. Finally processing successfully reconstructs a 
clear PRBS waveform and a big eye opening. This paper 
reports the signal processing in detail with showing 7 
Gbps 127-bit PRBS waveform. 
 
1. Introduction 
1.1 Background 
High-speed digital interface devices are evaluated for their 
transmitted waveform integrity using PRBS or device 
specific test patterns. The frequency spectrum of those 
signals is dispersed to more than 10 GHz. Such a high 
frequency signal is attenuated by the frequency 
characteristics of the signal path, so the measured 
waveform is often compensated by de-embedding the s-
 parameters of signal transmission lines. Since those 
interfaces are usually exposed to a harsh noisy 
environment, the transmission signal is contaminated by 
jitter. Moreover such devices may employ SSC (Spread 
Spectrum Clocking) for reducing EMI (Electro-Magnetic 
Interference) outside the device. So, the signal speed looks 
stable in a short period of time; however, the UI (Unit 
Interval) is continuously and subtly changing around the 
nominal period. In this situation, capturing a whole 
waveform set is not an easy task for digital ATE which is 
designed to capture signals with as stable a frequency as 
possible. My colleagues and I reported a method to 
reconstruct a clear waveform and an eye pattern (or 
diagram) at ITC 2012. It is named DNA (Data aNAlysis) 
and RNA (Recovering aNAlysis). This method can 
dramatically recover a clear waveform; however it 
requires a reference signal in addition to the target signal 
and the test conditions are not clearly organized yet. [1]  
Mixed signal ATE such as the Advantest V93000 can be 
equipped with a waveform sampler [2] to test UHF signals, 
which has a very wide band sample-and-hold circuit and a 
high-speed A/D converter in the analog front-end. This 
resource can capture high-speed digital waveforms as well 
as UHF analog signals. There is an issue for the sampler to 
capture high-speed digital signals containing slow jitter. 
This paper specifically reports how it removes slow jitter 
from the measured signal and reconstructs a clear 
waveform and a big eye opening.

1.2 Coherent Waveform Reconstruction 
When denoting the test signal and the sampling 
frequencies as Ft and Fs respectively, and the number of 
signal cycles and the number of sampling points M and N 
respectively, there is a coherent equation defined as 
follows: 
N
 M
 Fs
 Ft
 =      (1) 
 
Lecture 4.3                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                        2                    
                                                    
Where M and N should be integers and relatively prime. 
This is the coherent condition which is important to 
comply with in mixed signal tests. [3] Figure 1 (a) 
illustrates a 3-cycle (=M) sinusoidal waveform which is 
sampled with 10 (=N) sampling strobes. The sampled 
points are marked with numbered dots. Since three and ten 
are relatively prime, each sampled point resides at a 
different primary phase of the sinusoid.  The M-cycle 
sinusoid can be reshuffled based on the primary phase 
sequence to make up a single-cycle sinusoid. Figure 1 (b) 
illustrates how it is reshuffled. This reshuffling processing 
is called coherent waveform reconstruction (CWR). This is 
very useful in mixed signal tests; for example, it is 
effective as a quick signal integrity check in online debug. 
Moreover, CWR is a very important method for 
reconstructing a waveform which has been under-sampled 
by a waveform sampler. Mixed signal ATE provides an 
application specific processing instruction to perform the 
CWR. [4] 
1.3 Under-sampling by Waveform Sampler 
Figure 2 illustrates a ribbon of the panoramic frequency 
domain. The red line marked Fs indicates the location of 
the actual sampling rate. N (=32 in the figure) denotes the 
number of sampling points. Then, a FFT (Fast Fourier 
Transform) generates N/2 bins of spectrum. The baseband 
bin numbers are 0, 1, 2, …, 15, and higher frequency 
components  are extended in bin numbers as 16, 17, 18, … 
The broad range of the frequency domain can be 
considered as a series of N/2-size pages concatenated 
together. When performing under-sampling, you should 
consider the concatenated pages are folded page-wise as 
(b), and degenerated into a single baseband page as (c). 
Consequently the FFT provides the baseband spectrum 
illustrated as (d) at the end. 
 
Figure 2 Page Concept of Under-sampling 
 
For instance, if you have test signal spectra at extended bin 
numbers of 35, 70 and 105 as (a) illustrates, when 
performing under-sampling, they are aliased and found at 
the bins 3, 6 and 9 in the baseband as (d) illustrates. This is 
the methodology the waveform sampler uses to capture 
and analyze very high frequency signals regardless of 
violating the Nyquist theorem. Under-sampling loses the 
frequency information of test signal. However, in device 
testing situation the test signal is well known in advance so 
this does not become an issue. 
The Nyquist theorem prescribes Ft<(Fs/2) so that M<(N/2). 
In under-sampling situation Equation (1) can be extended 
as follows; 
N
 Mx
 K
 N
 M
 Fs
 Ft
 +==     (2) 
Where K and Mx are integers. Mx should be selected as (-
 N/2)<Mx<(N/2). Then |Mx| becomes the aliased bin 
number in the baseband in Figure 2 (d). [5]  
1.4 Under-sampling of Wideband Signal  
The target signal is a PRBS bit stream which actually 
becomes a wideband multi-tone signal. Figure 3 illustrates 
the frequency domain of a multi-tone test signal as well as 
the sampler extended frequency domain. 
 
Figure 3 Under-sampling of Wideband Signal 
 
Let’s suppose that the test signal multi-tone consists of 
total L lines of spectra, whose frequency spacing is ?F. If 
you capture this wideband signal with N sampling points 
by under-sampling, all spectral lines must be 
accommodated in the baseband which consists of N/2 bins.  
So N>2L. The original signal spectra must fall exactly in 
the sampler’s extended bin locations one by one, so 
?F=Nx•Fres, where Nx is an integer and Fres=Fs/N which 
is the sampler’s frequency resolution. N should be selected 
as 2n for the FFT. When folding the pages by under-
 sampling, each one of the aliased bins must not duplicate 
each other in the baseband. So Nx must be selected as an 
odd integer. Consequently the waveform sampler should 
be programmed based on the following guidelines: [6] 
” N>2L   (N=2n for FFT)  (3) 
” Fs=N•?F/Nx  (Nx=Odd Integer) (4) 
1.5 Test Condition 
A digital pin driver of the V93000 generates a 127-bit 
PRBS bit stream running at the speed of 7 Gbps. The 
resource to capture this signal is the waveform sampler 
“MCC” (Multi-Channel analog resource C), which is 
capable of capturing analog signals up to approximately 10 
GHz. Its actual sampling rate is a maximum of 110 Msps. 
 
Lecture 4.3                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                        3                    
                                                    
Therefore, even an extremely wideband signal must be 
captured within the baseband maximum of 55 MHz. 
In order to generate a 2-UI eye pattern (that is convenient 
to see), let’s program the waveform sampler to observe 
two loops of the 127-bit PRBS, so a total 254 UIs of PRBS 
data is actually captured as illustrated in Figure 4. When 
you reshuffle the captured waveform by the factor of 127, 
a 2-UI window eye is efficiently reconstructed. 
 
Figure 4 Target Signal Structure (2 Loops of 127-bit PRBS)  
 
The frequency of slow jitter or SSC here is assumed to be 
around several kHz to several 10’s of kHz so that the 
sampler’s frequency resolution should be on the order of 
kHz. Then the sampling condition based on guidelines (3) 
(4) is determined as follows: 
” Number of Sampling Points:           N=65536 Points 
” Resolution Ratio (?F/Fres):       Nx=16425 
” Sampling Rate:             Fs=109.961049389374 Msps 
When using this condition, the target signal would be 
under-sampled in the way Figure 5 illustrates. The main 
lobe of the 7 Gbps 127-bit PRBS signal consists of 127 
tones below 7 GHz at regular intervals as (a) illustrates. 
 
Figure 5  Frequency Structure of Under-sampled Target Signal 
 
Table 1 shows some of the tone frequencies and aliased 
bin locations calculated by the extended coherent Equation 
(2). The first tone is located at approximately 55.12 MHz, 
the second tone is located at approximately at 110.24 MHz 
and so on. The sampling rate of the waveform sampler is 
approximately 110 Msps, so the baseband is approximately 
55 MHz wide and the extended pages appear as Figure 5 
(b) illustrates. Therefore, when all spectral tones are 
aliased in the baseband, the even numbered tones which 
have positive Mx in Table 1 would fall on the left-hand 
side and the odd numbered tones which have negative Mx 
would be aliased on the right-hand side of the baseband as 
Figure 5 (c) illustrates.  
 
Table 1 Aliased Bin Locations of 7 Gbps 127-bit PRBS 
 
2. Signal Processing Strategy 
2.1 Reality of Jitter Influenced Signal 
The first experiment tested the 7 Gbps 127-bit PRBS 
signal containing a sinusoidal jitter of 5 kHz 200ps-pp. 
 
Figure 6 Reconstructed Waveform and Eye (7 Gbps PRBS) 
 
Figure 6 (a) shows the raw waveform measured by the 
waveform sampler with the condition described in the 
previous section. Then the waveform is reshuffled by the 
factor of Nx (=16425), reconstructing the PRBS waveform 
shown in (b). There are 254 UIs captured, so it displays 
approximately 36.3 ns (=254/7GHz) of the period. 
Actually, it takes approximately 596 us (=65536/110MHz) 
for the waveform sampler to complete the capture. So the 
 
Lecture 4.3                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                        4                    
                                                    
actual measured period contains approximately three 
cycles of the 5 kHz jitter waveform. Consequently the 
reconstructed trace is greatly blurred and collapsed by the 
jitter as (c) shows. Finally, the waveform (b) is reshuffled 
by the factor of 127, generating an eye pattern as shown in 
(d); however no eye opening can be found at all because 
the trace is extremely blurred. This is the influence of the 
slow jitter on the measurement made by a waveform 
sampler. 
A sampling oscilloscope usually integrates a CDR (Clock 
Data Recovery) capability to follow slow data clock 
fluctuations so that it can display clear signal traces. 
However, waveform samplers in ATE usually do not 
integrate such functionality, so this problem cannot be 
resolved without a special post processing. 
 
 
Figure 7   Spectrum of Jitter Influenced Signal (7 Gbps PRBS) 
 
2.2 Spectrum of Jitter Influenced Signal 
Applying the FFT directly to the measured waveform, 
Figure 7 discloses the frequency spectrum of the jitter 
influenced signal as estimated in Figure 5 (c). The odd 
numbered tones are located on the right-hand side and the 
even numbered tones are located on the left-hand side in 
the baseband. Figure 7 (b) (c) (d) and (e) are close up 
views of the areas marked (P) (Q) (R) and (S) in (a). Mx 
numbers are printed besides each tone. The tone spacing is 
164 units of sampler resolution so the distance corresponds 
to approximately 275 kHz. Each tone actually looks 
modulated by the jitter. As (c) and (d) clearly indicates, it 
looks like a typical PM spectrum. Therefore, in order to 
recover a clear waveform trace, you need to remove the 
modulation effect of the jitter.  
2.3 Equation of Carrier Tone Recovery  
Jitter is a kind of phase modulation (PM) to each tone of 
the multi-tone. Let’s denote a tone as cos(?t+?), where ? 
and ? are the angular frequency and the phase of the 
carrier tone. The jitter influenced signal, that is the PM 
modulated tone, can be described as cos(?t+?+?(t)), 
where ?(t) (≈0) is the PM component. It is required to 
process and recover the cos(?t+?) component from the 
measured signal of cos(?t+?+?(t)). For simple expression, 
let’s denote cos(?t+?+?(t)) as cos(?+?). So cos?  is what 
to be recovered. The signal sin(?+?) is the orthogonal 
component of the measured signal cos(?+?). Since ?(t)≈0, 
considering the approximation of cos?(t)≈1 and sin?(t)≈0, 
the PM modulated carriers can be modified as follows; 
???≈
 ?????=+?
 sincos
 sinsin)(coscos)cos(
 ?
 ??? t  (5) 
?+?≈
 ??+??=+?

Equations (5) and (6) are modified respectively as follows; 
?++?=? sin)cos(cos ??    (7) 
??+?=? cos)sin(sin ??    (8) 
Combining Equations (7) and (8), the carrier signal cos? 
is derived as follows; 
{ }
 ??+?++?=
 ??+?++?=
 ?++?=?
 cos)sin()cos(
 cos)sin()cos(
 sin)cos(cos

Finally the carrier cos?=cos(?t+?) is resolved as follows; 
2)(1

  (11) 
This equation is the key to recover the original carrier. 
Herein cos(?t+?+?(t)) corresponds to each one of the PM 
modulated spectrum groups of measured signal. In order to 
resolve cos(?t+?) using Equation (11), the PM component 
?(t) and the orthogonal component sin(?t+?+?(t)) must be 
calculated first. Therefore two pieces of data processing 
are required for resolving Equation (11). One is the PM 
demodulation for ?(t), and the other is the generation of 
orthogonal component sin(?t+?+?(t)) from the measured 
signal cos(?t+?+?(t)).  
 
Lecture 4.3                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                        5                    
                                                    
2.4 PM Demodulation 
The original measured waveform is a multi-tone. Since 
each one of the tones is actually PM modulated here, the 
demodulation processing of Equation (11) should be 
performed on each modulated tone. Figure 8 describes the 
procedure in detail. First, the FFT transforms the measured 
waveform (a) into the multi-tone spectrum as (b). Second, 
a single tone-group is extracted from the multiple tone-
 groups as (c). Third, the extracted spectrum group is 
converted into a waveform by the IFFT (Inverse FFT) as 
(d), and which is finally demodulated by the orthogonal 
demodulation method (ODM). [5] 
 
Figure 8 Extraction of Jitter Influenced Tone Group 
 
 
Figure 9 PM Demodulation by ODM 
 
Figure 9 illustrates the ODM from the spectrum point of 
view. The red circled part of processing (a) (b) (c) and (d) 
is performed in the time domain. The reference cosine and 
sine waveforms in (b) are mathematically generated array 
data in the computer program. The frequency of the cosine 
and sine exactly equals the target carrier frequency ? 
which is the aliased frequency in the baseband. This can 
be calculated by the test condition. The generated cosine 
and sine waveforms are respectively multiplied by the 
extracted tone group waveform. Then each of them is 
clearly split into the low frequency component and twice 
the carrier frequency component as (c), so the low pass 
filtering (LPF) can extract the low frequency components 
x and y respectively as (d) illustrates. Finally the 
arctangent of y/x derives the PM component ?(t) in 
Equation (11).  
Figure 10 (a) shows the demodulated phase trends for the 
odd number tones: 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 of Figure 7 (a); Figure 
10 (b) shows the phase trends for the even number tones: 2, 
4, 6, 8 and 10 of Figure 7 (a). They have exactly the same 
frequency, but the odd and the even number groups are 
exactly out-of-phase each other. According to Table 1, the 
even numbered tones have positive Mx, and the odd 
numbered tones have negative Mx. However, their 
amplitudes are proportional to the original tone numbers. 
The amplitude of tone number k is k times the amplitude 
of tone number 1. 
 
Figure 10 Demodulated Phase Trend 
 
As Figure 7 (a) shows, each tone level gradually reduces 
so the lower the tone level, the more difficult accurate 
demodulation becomes.  In order to avoid recovering 
inaccurate trends from the small level tones, phase trends 
demodulated from the major level tones are normalized 
and averaged. Figure 10 (c) shows the averaged phase 
trend based on the top 76 tones in this particular example. 
The amplitude is normalized to the first tone. There is 
clearly a 3-cycle jitter trend. 
2.5 Orthogonal Component Generation 
Further processing is required to solve Equation (11). The 
component sin(?t+?+?(t)) needs to be derived from the 
measured component cos(?t+?+?(t)). Equation (12) 
simply shows that sin ? can be generated by rotating cos ? 
by -90 degrees.  
?
 pi
 ? sin)
 2
 cos( =?     (12) 
xjyyjxj ??=?+?? )()(    (13) 
The -90 degree rotation is actually equivalent to 
multiplying -j to the complex spectrum component in the 
frequency domain. Equation (13) indicates that -j 
multiplication is first exchanging the real and the 
imaginary parts and then the imaginary part of the result is 
negated. Consequently the -90 degree rotation processing 
can be realized as illustrated in Figure 11. [6] This 
processing is performed in the frequency domain and 
 
Lecture 4.3                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                        6                    
                                                    
finally the spectrum is converted back to the waveform by 
the IFFT. 
 
Figure 11 Signal Processing of -90 degree Rotation 
 
2.6 Total Signal Processing Scheme 
The PM demodulation and the -90 degree rotation are 
discussed in the previous sections. The point is that these 
operations should be performed on each one of the multi-
 tone line groups. Figure 12 illustrates the schematic of 
total signal processing for recovering the clear waveform 
and eye pattern. After processing with Equation (11), the 
reconstructed waveform is distorted as the pulse width gets 
narrower, the smaller the amplitude becomes. Therefore 
the waveform should be subjected to a kind of equalization.  
The power of each recovered carrier is compensated to 
restore the original power of the PM modulated state. 
Figure 12 includes this processing. The effect will be 
shown in detail in the next section. 
 
Figure 12 Flow of Waveform & Eye Reconstruction 
3. Experimental Results 
3.1 Refined Waveform and Eye Pattern 
Equation (11) is applied to each one of the tones. The 
averaged phase trend in Figure 10 (b) is proportionally 
scaled according to the tone number and incorporated in 
the processing. Then the reconstructed PRBS waveform 
looks refined with the thin trace as Figure 13 (a). Its 
spectrum appears organized as (b). However, the 
amplitude of the narrow pulses is smaller than expected. 
This is because the power of the spectrum is not adjusted 
well frequency-wise. The PM modulation makes the 
carrier energy spread out around the original carrier 
location. The power of recovered single tone on Equation 
(11) is different from the original power. 
 
Figure 13 Recovered Waveform & Spectrum (7 Gbps PRBS) 
 
 
Figure 14 Power Compensated Waveform & Spectrum 
 
By collecting the signal power of each tone group in 
Figure 8, the original power of each carrier can be restored. 
Consequently the reconstructed signal is improved as 
Figure 14 illustrates. 
 
 
Figure 15 PRBS Waveform & Eye (7 Gbps PRBS 127 bits) 
 
 
Lecture 4.3                                   INTERNATIONAL TEST CONFERENCE                                        7                    
                                                    
Figure 15 contrasts the original blurred PRBS waveform 
(a)(b) and the final refined waveform (c)(d). The PRBS is 
dramatically refined. When reshuffling the waveform (c), a 
big open eye pattern is restored as (e).  
3.2 Different Conditions 
Let’s verify the effect in different conditions. Figure 16 
shows the 6 Gbps 127-bit PRBS with a 5 kHz 100 ps-pp 
jitter. Because of changing the bit rate, the FFT spectrum 
(b) of the measured waveform looks totally different from 
the case of 7 Gbps depicted in Figure 7 (a). 
 
 
Figure 16 6 Gbps 127-bit PRBS with Jitter 5 kHz 100 ps-pp 
 
Figure 17 shows the 5 Gbps 63-bit PRBS with 5 kHz 200 
ps-pp jitter. Both the bit rate and the PRBS length are 
changed. So the spectrum allocation in (b) looks totally 
different from the previous examples.  
The sampler used in this work covers bandwidth up to 10 
GHz. When testing 7 Gbps 127-bit PRBS stream, 181 
tones are accommodated in the 10 GHz band. When 
testing 6 Gbps 127-bit PRBS and 5 Gbps and 63 bits, 212 
and 126 tones are accommodated respectively in the band.  
As Figures 7 (a), 16 (b) and 17 (b) show, the spectrum 
allocation looks greatly different in an under-sampling 
situation. There are lots of possible numbers available for 
Nx in Equation (4). So you need to look for as good a 
number of Nx as possible for appropriate tone separation, 
that is as equal space of target spectral lines as possible. 
You may need to perform some trial measurements to find 
a well distributed spectrum condition. 
In Figures 16 and 17, the blurred waveforms and the eye 
patterns are successfully refined at the end by the 
processing described in Section 2 based on Equation (11). 
 
 
Figure 17 5 Gbps 63-bit PRBS with Jitter 5 kHz 200 ps-pp 
 
Figure 18 shows a more practical example that is an 
emulation of SSC applied bit stream. The test signal is the 
7 Gbps 31-bit PRBS, which is frequency modulated (FM) 
with a 31.5 kHz triangle signal. The frequency deviation is 
programmed as 0.01% of the bit rate that is 700 kHz. 
Figure 18 (a) is the primitive measured waveform, which 
is directly processed by the FFT, disclosing the frequency 
spectrum as (b). Since the test signal is generated by using 
a UHF AWG (arbitrary waveform generator), the 
programmed PRBS waveform is intentionally limited its 
spectrum into the main lobe only. So there are 31 tones 
captured in the baseband. The sampling rate is tuned up to 
make every tone distributed evenly in the baseband. Each 
tone is numbered from 1 to 31. Each tone is FM modulated. 
The bin #31 corresponds to the bit clock and it is the most 
deviated of all. Reshuffling the primitive waveform (a) by 
manner of CWR with the key number Nx, the two 
sequences of the PRBS waveform is reconstructed as (c). 
Since the measurement is greatly influenced by the SSC, 
the recovered PRBS waveform looks too smeared to see a 
clear trace. As discussed in Section 2.4, performing the 
PM demodulation and further processing, the phase trend 
is disclosed as (d). Then the differential of the phase trend 
reveals the triangle frequency trend as (e), whose spectrum 
is shown in (f). The triangle frequency is 31.5 kHz and the

4. Discussion and Limitation 
The waveform sampler used in this work has an analog 
bandwidth (ABW) of 10 GHz and an actual sampling rate 
(Fs) of 110 Msps. All signal tones in the ABW should be 
captured in the baseband of 55 MHz. When it captures 
65536 points (N) of data, the primitive frequency 
resolution is Fs/N that is approximately 1.7 kHz. So jitter 
more than several kHz can be removed appropriately. 
Figure 19 shows a part of Figure 7, illustrating the close-
 up primitive spectrum. Each tone is scattered by the jitter. 
The tone spacing is approximately 275 kHz wide so that 
the PM spread spectrum up to +/-138 kHz would not cross 
over each other. Then jitter up to 138 kHz can be removed 
in this situation. If you need to remove specific jitter 
frequency, you could apply a LPF processing in the PM 
demodulation scheme.

The number of bits of a PRBS corresponds to the number 
of tones contained in the main lobe or a side lobe of its 
spectrum. Therefore the bit rate of PRBS decides the way 
of multi-tone spectrum distribution. The ABW of the 
waveform sampler determines how many tones would be 
captured in the measurement. If you select an available 
sampler in an ATE, the ABW and Fs are given. Then the 
number of bits and the bit rate of the test signal PRBS 
should be carefully examined when making a test plan. 
Table 2 shows how many tones would be considered in the 
ABW of 10 GHz. The table says that the lower the bit rate, 
the more tones are captured in the baseband, which means 
the tone spacing becomes narrower for the fixed baseband 
width. On the other hand, the shorter the PRBS length, the 
fewer tones will be in the baseband. 
 
Table  2 Number of Tones to Be Accommodated 
 
In general, you should use a waveform sampler with as 
high an actual sampling rate as possible for expanding the 
baseband width. Then if you want to increase the tone 
spacing, reduce the PRBS length. The available tone space 
determines the recoverable jitter frequency and amplitude 
or the frequency deviation of SSC. 
Waveform samplers utilize aliasing to measure UHF 
signals. In under-sampling situation, jitter higher than half 
the sampling rate cannot be distinguished from the original 
existing jitter in the baseband.  
5. Conclusion 
Mixed signal ATE integrates a wideband waveform 
sampler which is a very useful resource to measure UHF

signals including high-speed digital waveforms. Unlike 
high-end oscilloscopes, ATE usually does not have CDR 
capability integrated into the hardware. While a waveform 
sampler performs under-sampling of the test signal, the 
captured waveform is influenced by slow jitter. The 
purpose of this work is to remove slow jitter effects such 
as SSC in a high-speed digital signal and restore a fine 
waveform and eye pattern. The test signal is a PRBS bit 
stream. Slow jitter reduction is realized by post processing, 
whose steps are: 
” PRBS becomes extremely wideband multi-tone. 
” Jitter is PM onto each tone. 
” Original tones can be recovered by Equation (11) 
which is constructed by the modulation signal (?), the 
measured signal (cos(?+?)) and its orthogonal signal 
(sin(?+?)). 
” Each modulated tone is extracted as a group and 
demodulated by the ODM, recovering the modulation 
signal (?). 
” The sin(?+?) is generated by ?90 degree rotation  
from the cos(?+?). The FFT & IFFT method takes 
care of this processing. 
” Recovered tones are equalized power-wise to their 
original modulated state. 
” CWR by the factor of Nx reconstructs a PRBS 
waveform. 
” A second CWR by the factor of the number of bits 
(eg. 127) constructs an eye pattern. 
Finally the developped processing procedure succeeded to 
reconstruct clear refined PRBS waveforms and wide open 
eye patterns. The key in the processing is that Equation 
(11) is derived as a relatively simple combination of 
acceptable processing components. This paper mainly 
discussed an example of a 7 Gbps 127-bit PRBS signal 
containing a jitter of 5kHz. The waveform sampler 
employed in the experiment has an actual sampling rate of 
110 Msps and the ABW of 10 GHz. Reduction of slow 
jitter and SSC is demonstrated in the examples. The multi-
 tone spectrum appearance in under-sampling situation 
greatly depends on the PRBS bit length and the bit rate of 
the signal. The sampling condition should be carefully 
chosen for the aliased multi-tone spectra to fall in the 
baseband with as even spacing as possible to avoid 
overlapping of the jitter-modulated spectrum with each 
other. If the Fs and ABW of sampler are given, the higher 
the PRBS bit rate and the shorter the PRBS bit length, the 
better for wider tone spacing.
