Abstract-Our analysis has shown that the convolutional 
interleaver has severe deleterious effects on throughput 
efficiency and processing delay over packet switched 
satellite communication links that use frequency hopping. 
This traditional interleaver must be flushed between data 
transmissions from different terminals whenever a circuit is 
used in a time division multiple access (TDMA) mode. This 
flushing wastes circuit resources, increases packet delay, and 
lowers utilization. A new approach to interleaving, the 
hybrid interleaver, that includes elements of both the block 
and convolutional interleavers does a more efficient job of 
mapping packets onto frequency hops."] ['I In most cases, 
this allows greater utilization of every hop assigned to a 
circuit. The bounds show that hybrid interleaving provides 
at least 300% greater circuit utilization than convolutional 
interleaving when multiple terminals share a packet circuit 
on a TDMA basis.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Satellite communication channels are an expensive resource. 
Convolutional interleavers when used with packets switched 
links can greatly reduce throughput and increase packet 
delay. For milsatcom, the uplinks and downlinks must be 
highly robust and frequency spreading, coding, and 
interleaving are all needed. This requires common 
synchronization of framing, packets, interleaver, frequency 
hopping, and both coded and user bits.

Most satellite communication systems traditionally have 
provided dedicated circuit services. This approach is a carry 
over from the traditional commercial telephone approach. 
Each circuit has dedicated coding, and interleaving. Circuit 
switching makes reservations straightforward. Satellite 
communication terminals reserve each circuit separately. 
When you need a channel you "dial up" the wanted number 
and a dedicated circuit, connectivity, and channel bandwidth 
is assigned. A set of terminals is assigned to a set of circuits 
for an indefinite duration. 
Circuits are optimum for continuous traffk between 
unchanging end points. However, packet traffic is bursty 
and the paths and destinations dynamically change. In the 
worst case they change on a packet by packet basis. New 
applications seems to be moving away from totally circuit 
switched connections to some form of packet switching 
because the latter offers the potential of significantly greater 
utilization. The latter is more suitable in most cases for 
future traffic when it is dominated by packetized computer 
data and multimedia. 
Packet service with a single terminal per circuit is 
straightforward for in-beam traffic since all downlink packet 
receivers are in the same antenna beam. Out-of-beam packet 
routing requires a separate dedicated circuit for each beam 
to beam data transfer combination, a gateway terminal with 
relatively low rate circuits each beam, to whom all 
crossbeam packet traffk is routed, or an on board packet 
switch. When a terminal must use several lower data rate 
circuits to route packets to multiple destinations beams, the 
terminal buffer queueing delay will be much larger than 
when using a single higher rate circuit to an on board packet 
switch. 
Since low packet buffer delay requires high data rate 
circuits. High-rate usage circuit usage may require TDMA

of several terminals with packet by packet sharing of a 
circuit. Convolutional interleaver flushing degrades multi- 
terminal packet by packet circuit sharing efficiency. Hybrid 
interleaved circuits need not be flushed with each change in 
packet transmitting terminal. Therefore, circuit-sharing on a 
packet by packet basis with a few terminals using a 
relatively high data rate circuit increases circuit utilization 
over that of a terminal using many relatively low rate 
circuits.

This study is a significant part of a trade on how to 
maximize throughput of packets within a circuit switched 
framework. We investigated the utilization versus delay 
relationship due to packet buffer delay, channel interleaver 
span delay and flushing delay. This study assumed that two 
or more terminals were time-sharing a circuit by toggling on 
a packet-by-packet basis. Table I shows our four payload 
and interleaving options. They were used as part of the 
basis to determine how to minimize data delay for in-beam 
and out-of-beam packet traffic, involving both uplinks and 
downlinks with crosslinks treated as out-of-beam 
destinations.

3. PACKET ROUTING 
Intra-beam packet routing requires no special packet 
handling on the payload, while inter-beam packet routing 
strongly effects utilization. Figure 1 shows three approaches 
for supporting inter-beam packet routing. The satellite 
payload contains the packet router in the first approach. 
Ground terminals do the inter-beam routing in the second 
and third approaches. The second assumes that their is a 
“master terminal” that functions as a packet router and 
provides the needed cross beam connectivity to all other 
terminals. 
Y 
where R is the steady state circuit baseband data rate (kbps) 
T, is the interleaver span (Seconds) 
N, is baseband bitslpacket 
The payload routing approach requires only N uplink and N 
downlink circuits for all N terminals to talk all of the other 
N-1 terminals.

The type A Terminal Routing requires that each terminal set 
up a circuit to each of the N beams to which it transmits 
packets. Since each circuit carries only part of that 
terminal’s total transmitted data rate each individually will 
have a relatively low rate depending on the expected level of 
traffic to each downlink or crosslink beam. This approach 
require N*(N-1) uplink as well as downlink circuits for each 
of N terminals to talk to all of the other terminals. This is a 
wasteful use of payload circuits. 
Terminal The links of a circuit switched 
packet router, system are usually transparent to the 
convolutional packets and streaming data they 
interleaving, contain. Nevertheless, multiple 
unprocessed packet source terminals may share 
orpartial such a data stream. If so they will 
process require a switching delay and 
payload overhead due to convolutional 
interleaver flush. Inter-beam packet 
routing yields larger queueing delay 
for multiple lower rate circuits to 
multiple beam positions.

and a payload and associated circuits are not

Convolutional interleaver flushing 
degrades the delay versus utilization 
In type B Terminal Routing terminals have direct circuits 
only to the ground packet router’s beam. If each of N 
terminals must talk to N beams there is a need for N higher 
rate uplink as well as downlink circuits. This terminal router 
relays packets to all N beams. The utilization delay impacts 
of types A and B Terminal Routing have not been taken into 
account quantitatively in the following analysis except to say 
that ground based routing for cross-beam traffic will 
increase delay andor decrease resource utilization from that 
shown herein. The features of each payload configuration 
and packet processing option are summarized in Table 111.

There are three contributions to circuit utilization. The f is t

M/M/l model to determine queueing delay. These traffic

5. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 
Table V is a summary by option of the performance results. 
There are several reasons why convolutional interleaving 
doesn’t permit 100% utilization. (See Figures 3 & 4) 
Flushing is required prior to every change in the-transmitting’ 
terminal. Flushing loss forces the use of many lower data 
rate circuits. Circuit utilization depends on the 
convolutional interleaver span.

There are several reasons why data delay is minimized using 
hybrid interleaving on circuits. (See Figure 2). TDMA of 
packets on a hybrid interleaved circuit permits a higher 
baseband data rate thus less delay. Circuit utilization is 
independent of hybrid interleaver span. Packet buffer delay 
is also independent of hybrid interleaver span. Uplink 
traffic intended for crossbeams is assumed as 6% of the total 
terminal data rate. Buffer delay increases from 0.1 to 16 
Seconds for 98% utilization with hybrid interleaver as one 
lowers the circuit rate from 8 Mbps to 32 kbps. Thus 
TDMA of packets within each circuit is minimized by using 
the highest baseband data rate. (Figure 2) Hybrid 
interleaving should be used in all full processed nodes. 
Comparing the bounds shown in Figures 2 and 3, the hybrid 
provides at least 300% greater utilization for the worst 
hybrid interleaved modulation and data rate modes 
304 
compared to the best convolutionally interleaved modulation 
and data rate modes. 
There are several suggestions for further work. Analysis 
and/or simulation combined queueingkontrol model for 
utilization versus delay for specific hardware configurations 
and packet routing, flow control, and protocol algorithms is 
needed to determine actual throughput delay effects of 
packet DAMA algorithms. The actual improvement in 
throughput delay of space-based versus ground-based packet 
router location can be obtained through simulation. 
Particularly the degree of improvement of throughput and 
decreased delay to cross beam users. An assessment of the 
impact of hybrid interleaving, packet to frequency hop 
synchronization, and other hardware and software on 
terminals and payload is needed. Assessment of the impact 
of provisioning or incorporating hybrid interleaving, 
packetffrequency hop synch, and other packet protocol- 
related features into terminals and potential satellite 
payloads for efficient packet processing is also needed.
